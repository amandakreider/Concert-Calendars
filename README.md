# Concert Calendars
 
Concert Calendars scrapes local Philadelphia concert listings and creates up-to-date calendar files in iCal format that users can subscribe to. So far I have written Python code to pull concert listings for the Fillmore, the Foundry, and The Met. All calendars are refreshed daily.

## Fillmore/Foundry

You can find the script for the Fillmore and the Foundry listings [here](https://github.com/amandakreider/Concert-Calendars/blob/main/scripts/fillmorecal.py) and the resulting .ics file [here](https://github.com/amandakreider/Concert-Calendars/blob/main/calendars/fillmore_events.ics). This script also creates a [.csv file with the concert listings](https://github.com/amandakreider/Concert-Calendars/blob/main/csv/fillmore_events.csv). To subscribe to the Fillmore/Foundry calendar, use [this .ics link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amandakreider/Concert-Calendars/main/calendars/fillmore_events.ics). 

## The Met

You can find the script for the Met listings [here](https://github.com/amandakreider/Concert-Calendars/blob/main/scripts/metcal.py) and the resulting .ics file [here](https://github.com/amandakreider/Concert-Calendars/blob/main/calendars/met_events.ics). This script also creates a [.csv file with the concert listings](https://github.com/amandakreider/Concert-Calendars/blob/main/csv/met_events.csv). To subscribe to the Met calendar, use [this .ics link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amandakreider/Concert-Calendars/main/calendars/met_events.ics).
