# Concert Calendars
 
Concert Calendars is a tool for creating iCal web calendars from local concert listings. So far I have written Python code to pull listings for the Fillmore and the Foundry. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/amandakreider/Concert-Calendars/blob/main/fillmorecal.py) and the .ics file [here](https://github.com/amandakreider/Concert-Calendars/blob/main/fillmore_events.ics).
