# Concert Calendars
 
Concert Calendars scrapes local Philadelphia concert listings and creates up-to-date calendar files in iCal format that users can subscribe to. You can find the Python scripts [in this folder](https://github.com/amandakreider/Concert-Calendars/blob/main/scripts). The scripts save concert listings in both [.ics](https://github.com/amandakreider/Concert-Calendars/blob/main/calendars/) and [.csv](https://github.com/amandakreider/Concert-Calendars/tree/main/csv) formats.

Please note that the scripts are defunct as of April 2025 and need to be updated to run properly.
