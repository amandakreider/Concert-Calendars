# Concert Calendars
 
Concert Calendars scrapes local Philadelphia concert listings and creates up-to-date calendar files in iCal format that users can subscribe to. 

So far I have written Python code to pull concert listings for the Fillmore and the Foundry. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/amandakreider/Concert-Calendars/blob/main/scripts/fillmorecal.py) and the resulting .ics file [here](https://github.com/amandakreider/Concert-Calendars/blob/main/calendars/fillmore_events.ics). To subscribe to the Fillmore/Foundry calendar, use [this .ics link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amandakreider/Concert-Calendars/main/calendars/fillmore_events.ics).
