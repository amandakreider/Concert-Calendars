 8PM – Show\n \nDave Kiss Presents\nBAD BAD HATS\n \nBad Bad Hats are an 
 indie rock trio from Minneapolis\, Minnesota. Known for bringing a joyful\
 , exuberant presence to their live shows\, touring with The Beths\, Margar
 et Glaspy\, The Front Bottoms\, Hippo Campus\, and Third Eye Blind\, the g
 roup took specific care to bring their fun-loving spirit to their third LP
 \, Walkman. \n \nKerry (guitar/vocals)\, Chris (bass)\, and Con (drums) l
 et their collective hair down on Walkman\, bringing raucous and explosive 
 riffs alongside witty lyrics. Though you might not notice from their indie
  rock exterior\, Bad Bad Hats draws a heavy influence from classic pop son
 gwriting that shines through in their hooky choruses and strong melodic se
 nsibilities. \n \nTHE GULLY BOYS\n \nThe Gully Boys origin story plays ou
 t like the perfect domino effect. While sorting vintage clothes in a Minne
 apolis-area Ragstock in 2016\, Kathy Callahan (she/her) shared her dream o
 f becoming a vocalist with Nadirah McGill (they/them). After encouraging a
  friend from middle school\, Natalie Klemond (she/her)\, to join the trio 
 on bass\, Nadi picked up a pair of drumsticks and counted off a cover of B
 est Coast’s “Girlfriend.” From there\, they had to master their inst
 ruments on the fly\, growing as creatives while blossoming with their firs
 t material. After their debut EP landed online a year later\, Gully Boys r
 eleased their debut LP Not So Brave in 2018\, earning Best New Band honors
  from their hometown City Pages and sharing the stage with everyone from T
 he Hold Steady to Third Eye Blind. The band’s Phony EP arrived in late 2
 019 on the edge of a screeching halt. \n

 – Doors8PM – Show\n \n \n \nL.A. WITCH (9:00 PM)\n \nL.A. Witch’s s
 elf-titled debut album unfurled like hazy memories of late night revelries
  in the city center creeping back in on a hungover Sunday morning. Guitari
 st/vocalist Sade Sanchez purred and crooned over jangling guitar chords\, 
 painting pictures of urban exploits\, old American haunts\, and private es
 capades with a master’s austerity. Bassist Irita Pai and drummer Ellie E
 nglish polished the patina of the band’s vintage sound\, adding a full-b
 odied thump and intoxicating swing to the album’s dusty ballads\, ominou
 s invitations\, and sultry rock songs. The album had an air of effortlessn
 ess\, like these songs were written into the fabric of the Western landsca
 pe by some past generation and conjured into our modern world by three pow
 erful conduits. The band readily admits that L.A. Witch was a casual affai
 r and that the songs came together over the course of several years. That 
 natural flow hit a snag when the band’s popularity grew and they began t
 ouring regularly\, so a new strategy became necessary for their sophomore 
 album\, the swaggering and beguiling Play With Fire.\n \nWhere L.A. Witch 
 oozed with vibe and atmosphere\, with the whole mix draped in reverb\, son
 ically placing the band in some distant realm\, broadcast across some unkn
 own chasm of time\, Play With Fire comes crashing out of the gate with a b
 old\, brash\, in-your-face rocker “Fire Starter.” The authoritative op
 ener is a deliberate mission statement. “Play With Fire is a suggestion 
 to make things happen\,” says Sanchez. “Don’t fear mistakes or the f
 uture. Take a chance. Say and do what you really feel\, even if nobody agr
 ees with your ideas. These are feelings that have stopped me in the past. 
 I want to inspire others to be freethinkers even if it causes a little bur
 n.” And by that line of reasoning\, “Fire Starter” becomes a call to
  action\, an anthem against apathy. From there the album segues into the s
 imilarly bodacious rocker “Motorcycle Boy”—a feisty love song inspir
 ed by classic cinema outlaws like Mickey Rourke\, Marlon Brando\, and Stev
 e McQueen. At track three we hear L.A. Witch expand into new territories a
 s “Dark Horse” unfurls a mixture of dustbowl folk\, psychedelic breakd
 owns\, and fire-and-brimstone organ lines. And from there the band only ge
 ts more adventurous.\n \nCULT OBJECTS (8:00 PM)\nCult Objects are a Philad
 elphia post-punk trio with equal love for cacophony and melody. Featuring 
 Larissa Sapko on bass\, Charlotte Anne Dole on drums\, and Lauren Leilani 
 Iona on guitar and vocals\, their debut record Secrets of Pain-Free Living
  is all thrashing guitars and relentless drums\, screaming lyrics that are
  simultaneously vicious and vulnerable. You can find their music streaming
  on all platforms\, at cultobjects.bandcamp.com or through Philly based 
 punk distribution label World Gone Mad (worldgonemadrecords.bandcamp.com).

 s9:00 PM – Show\nDUMMY (11:15 PM)\n \nLos Angeles band Dummy refuses to 
 slow down. After releasing two cassette EP’s in 2020 (on Popwig and Born
  Yesterday respectively)\, Dummy’s debut full-length album arrives via C
 hicago’s Trouble in Mind Records. Employing pummeling guitars and celest
 ial ambience within the same breath\, the band folds a myriad of reference
  points into their drone-pop style. Influence from ‘60s melodicism and 
 ‘90s UK noise pop can be found woven in with inspiration from spiritual 
 jazz\, Japanese new age\, and Italian minimalism.\n \nDummy dodges the bro
 oding\, dark\, dramatic tropes of contemporary “artistic” music often 
 found in punk\, experimental\, and electronic\, instead insisting on joyou
 s and euphoric sonic palettes. They refuse to be artistically stagnant\, c
 ontinuously shifting their approach to writing across 12 tracks. Shaped by
  performances around Los Angeles in 2019\, songs like “Daffodils” and 
 “Fissured Ceramics” feature relentless driving energy and ample psyche
 delic noise. Elsewhere\, Dummy counterbalances the aggression with meditat
 ive synthscapes focused on sound design and studio experimentation\, like 
 on the motorik “X-Static Blanket”. Finally\, centerpiece “H.V.A.C.
 ” and the album’s final track\, “Atonal Poem”\, seek to synthesize
  these two poles\, offering multi-part journeys through uncharted sonic te
 rritory.\n \nIn contrast to blissed-out instrumentation\, Dummy’s sardon
 ic lyricism examines “the burden of modern life\, consumerism\, environm
 ental collapse\, alienation\, and other anxieties born out of living in th
 is absurd moment in history”. Interior design\, marine pollution\, the p
 sychology of commercial architecture\, and nuclear testing are all feature
 d subjects. Dummy’s restless creativity keeps them moving ever-forward\,
  continuously challenging themselves and pushing their sound into exciting
  and exhilarating places. This is – as the album title suggests – “M
 andatory Enjoyment”.\nLIFEGUARD (10:30 PM)\n \nChicago\, IL\nKNIFEPLAY (

  – Show\n\n \nBIG NOTHING (11:15 PM)\nBig Nothing like to joke that the 
 real reason for band practice is the prospect of getting dinner afterwards
 . It’s a self-deprecating take on their motivations\, but it’s not a b
 ad place to start with capturing what makes the Philadelphia-based four-pi
 ece so endearing. Big Nothing make the kind of timeless guitar music that
 ’s as comforting as it is catchy\, and their sophomore full-length and L
 ame-O Records debut\, Dog Hours\, offers ten convivial rock songs that rad
 iate with the warmth of an old friend who’s always there to help you nav
 igate the ups and downs of life.\nDUST STAR (10:30 PM)\nDust Star was born
  in the dead of night on Halloween\, under theinfluence of a twinkling des
 ert sky and two tabs of LSD. JustinJurgens (Sirs) and Cameron Wisch (Cende
 \, Porches) sat with guitars onthe floor of the “Caboose”\, a shipping
 -container-turned-bedroom\,sharing songs they had written over the last fe
 w years. They playedand played until their fingers melted\, all-the-while 
 seeing thepotential of a powerful musical collaboration. They decided to j
 oinforces\, and the “roll-your-windows-down power-pop” outfit Dust Sta
 rwas formed.\nGOSHUPON (9:45 PM)\nGoshupon leaves you feeling refreshed an
 d energized. Goshupon has no added proteins or vitamins.  Goshupon songs 
 are scientifically designed to be fluid and malleable so that any player
 ’s personality may shine thru the challenge of the songwriting. Goshupon
  is supposed to be fun for everyone. Goshupon can be eaten right out of th
 e ground. Goshupon Volume 1 out soon. \nWEBB CHAPEL (9:00 PM)\n“I’m k
 ind of never in the same place for very long.”  For Zack Claxton\, that
  sense of constant uprooting carries over into his approach to songwriting
 .  The Philly-based artist has spent the last five years dividing his tim
 e between Philadelphia and Dallas.  “I finally signed a lease in March 
 and figured it was time to see what’s what as far as the stuff I’d bee
 n making.”  \n \nFollowing the dissolution of Austin-based experimenta
 l band Beth Israel\, Claxton began drawing in the margins\, putting down s
 ketches of ideas and song fragments that would end up becoming the basis f
 or Webb Chapel’s first two releases\, Moverama and Like the Country. \n
  \nOn his newest release Vernon Manor\, Claxton remains firmly in the ethe
 r\, to an almost destructive degree.  “I like the idea of dismantling s
 ongs as you’re listening to them.  Sort of taking them apart and puttin
 g them back together.”  When the lens focuses\, however\, you get a sen
 se that this e.p comes from an altogether intentional place.  The freneti
 c pace and energy develops into a kind of emotional catharsis. Like so muc
 h of the current state we find ourselves in\, it’s neither coming nor go
 ing. It is\, whether you like it or not.  Vernon Manor comes out in Septe
 mber on Strange Mono Records.\n

 tin is a Chicago-born singer-songwriter who grew up in rural Wisconsin\, m
 ostly waiting for Billie Holiday videos to load on back-country dial-up or
  making trips in a busted Geo Metro to watch punk shows in Milwaukee. Trai
 ned as a hairdresser\, she didn’t have musical plans beyond joke singing
  harmonies over the radio. She fronted the acclaimed experimental-folk-pop
  sextet\, PHOX\, formed just outside Madison\, Wisconsin. Eventually\, Mon
 ica moved to LA because “Wisconsin is cold as f*ck”. She found herself
  a little periwinkle casita and is feeling freer than ever in the city of 
 misfits. She’s presently at work putting melodies to her “explorations
  in romantic f*ckery” with lowkey pop songs with blue note whispers\, so
 me golden-era Hollywood dramatics\, and psychedelic flickers courtesy of a
  theremin. Monica is still figuring out who she is\, but quite happy to sh

  learned classical piano by listening to his father play Bach every mornin
 g. If not for an intervention – stumbling upon the catalog of Weird Al Y
 ankovic at 11 years old – he would have followed in his father’s path 
 or perhaps become a jazz purist.  But Weird Al changed everything.   Jak
 e started a parody band and sang his newly-written lyrics to classics like
  “All Star” by Smashmouth and “Men in Black” by Will Smith\, along
  with composing new family classics such as “Amy\, You’re Turning 49
 ” and “Charles\, Charles Sherman.” \n \nFast forward some years bey
 ond his time studying at Berklee College of Music and it’s clear Jake ha
 s found a way to combine his appreciation of great songwriting with his pi
 ano/organ-playing prowess.   He has become a go-to musician on recordings
 \, and tours for artists including Meshell Ndegeocello\, Bilal\, Emily Kin
 g\, Blood Orange\, Benny Sings\, Doyle Bramhall II\, Gabriel Garzon-Montan
 o\, Andrew Bird and Nick Hakim.  Everything from gospel heavyweight Doobi
 e Powell’s “Close to You” to Chance the Rapper’s Grammy-winning so
 ng “No Problem” includes Jake’s work. \n \nMore recently\, while ba
 sed in Brooklyn\, Jake has re-tapped his well of musicality and songmaking
  to create his upcoming album\, Jake Sherman Gets Sexy.  Due March 2020\,
  the album is a journey through modern dating and relationships\, with a p
 oint of view that is somehow both poignant and Weird Al-esque. \n \n\n \n

 sing the arts over college. It was a fertile time in NY to explore theater
 \, art\, music— still connected to the late ’60s early ’70s undergro
 und scene that largely informed Imperioli’s artistic consciousness. That
  same year\, Amitin and Tighe were born. Amitin grew up going to Latin mus
 ic clubs with his father Mike Amitin who was a salsa musician in the golde
 n era of the New York Latin music scene. Tighe comes from an avant-garde a
 rt background\, who at age 14\, handed Amitin a Shuggie Otis record and ha

  there they spent the better part of 10 years touring relentlessly before 
 migrating to Queens New York in 2014. With a live show known for its raw\,
  visceral energy and relentless assault – leaving little to no stoppage 
 between songs – they barreled through countless NYC haunts and DIY venue

 nt time raising his three children.\n \nHe also found the time and inspira
 tion to write and record a new album\, Generations.\n \n“My first record
 \, Policy\, was a book of short stories\,” Butler says. “Generations i
 s more of a novel—despairing\, funny\, a little bit epic… A big chunk 
 of this record is asking: What’s my place in American history? What’s 
 my place in America’s present? Both in general—as a participant\, as w
 e all are\, in the shit that’s going down—but\, also extremely particu
 larly: me as Will Butler\, rich person\, white person\, Mormon\, Yankee\, 
 parent\, musician of some sort\, I guess. What do I do? What can I do? The
  record asks that question over and over\, even if it’s not much for ans
 wers.”\n \nWhile the songs on Generations contain their fair share of dr
 ead and regret\, there is ultimately a lightness that shines through Butle
 r’s music. That brightness is at its most intense when he and his solo b
 and—Miles Francis\, Sara Dobbs\, and Julie and Jenny Shore—perform on 
 stage. Their electricity is palpable throughout Generations\, with the bul
 k of the new songs having been worked out live. Wild synth production—gn
 arly bass synths with live drums—and anthemic backing vocals as on first
  single “Surrender” are punctuated by intimate\, direct moments: Butle
 r’s voice cracking on “Fine” as he conjures his ancestors\, and “P
 romised\,” a meditation on friendship\, how lives are built together\, a
 nd how and why they drift apart.\n \nGenerations was recorded and produced
  by Butler in the basement of his home in Brooklyn. Tracking finished in M

 R (10 PM)\n \nThe combination of modular synthesizer and viola is an uncom

 \, cohabitation\, shared experience\, and separate but equally inspired co

 ic hub Constellation. Chiu’s musical CV to that point included work with

 ession player for the likes of Adrian Younge and Beyoncé and played on re
 cordings by Chloe x Halle\, Angel Olsen\, Fleet Foxes\, and Stanley Clarke
 \, among others. Chiu has generated a strong unit of regular musical colla

 to the titular archipelago in the Baltic Sea between Sweden and Finland. C
 hiu and Honer were taken by the serene and strange quality of the place\, 
 where the sun doesn’t set in the summer and the network of miniature isl
 ands is traversed by ferry which\, according to Chiu\, “casts a surreal 
 horizontal movement through space and time.”\nASHLEY PAUL (9 PM)\n \nAsh
 ley Paul is an American multi-instrumentalist and composer based in London
 . Her intuitive process integrates free form song structures with a focuse

 \, clarinet\, voice\, prepared guitar and percussion she creates a delicat

 is a composer\, percussionist\, producer\, and educator. His compositions 
 are sculptural\, carved from the dense layering of instruments and manipul
 ated samples\, a pantonal harmonic sense\, and an intuitive approach to rh
 ythm. Stardrum has released three solo records (CRATER in 2021\, Tempora
 ry etc. in 2018 and Dance And in 2015). Temporary etc. is a highly pe
 rsonal amalgamation of electro-acoustics\, minimalism\, ambient\, jazz\, a
 nd contemporary experimental electronic music that “further solidifies S
 tardrum’s position as one of America’s most intriguing composers.”(T
 he Wire) CRATER expanded on the techniques of his previous effort with 
 “jaw-unhinging splatterdrum masterworks that seem to explode from Stardr
 um’s tactile performance.” (BoomKat)\n

 is the result of three years of writing\, and some considerable time spent
  apart: Louis relocated to Berlin and worked at a cinema (he sings in Germ

 ion.  Still only in her mid-twenties\, the record sounds like Ives grown 
 up: through the ten sophisti-pop tracks\, there’s more deliberate space 
 that lends breathing room to her most vulnerable\, exposed songwriting yet
 .  Throughout songs that are still full of punchy synths and unconvention
 al rhythms\, Ives uses the quiet spaces in between to honestly reflect on 
 her ongoing struggle to find stability and happiness.  Touching on sobrie
 ty\, overdoses\, and the desire to escape from the realities of modern lif
 e\, the record also focuses on the rewards of slowing down\, and finally f
 inding a home for herself in the ever-shifting world.\n \nIves’ penchant
  for poetic musings on specific details and references has always been par

 ge that’s entirely her own.   “Everyone has a shitty star tattoo/stic
 k n poke\, that’s never perfect\, or is rough around the edges. A beauti
 ful thing to think about is that stars on earth look like blobs but in spa
 ce really defined structures\,” she explains.  This fully-formed versio
 n of herself is the album’s guiding light\, and sees Ives take confident
  steps towards deciding her own fate.  Both self-possessed and yearning\,
  insular and affecting\, Janky Star’s effervescent daydreams are ultima
 tely triumphant\, where ultimately the very act of surviving can be the bi
 ggest achievement of all.\n

  crossover band with our roots set in hardcore. Established way back in 19
 82\, we have about 10 CD’s & 2 DVD’s out on various labels and are con
 sidered to be one of the forefathers of speed metal and thrash punk music.
  We started out in Texas and moved to the Bay Area cause we heard the SF a
 rea had free food at the soup kitchens (from which the classic tune was wr
 itten!!!!!)\nWhen we started our influences were bands like Black Flag and
  the Dead Kennedys. In 1982\, our first release\, which was really a demo\
 , the 22-song 7″ EP\, kickstarted our career as a formidable hardcore ba
 nd. 22 songs in 17 minutes. Blistering fast\, with on-the-dime cuts\, and 
 vocals to match. Said to contain the first grindcore blast ever recorded (
 No Sense). This record was later pressed into an LP\, and was considered t
 o be our first official release even though it was only 17 minutes. The 22
 -song debut eventually was combined with our second release\, 1984’s Vio
 lent Pacification EP\, and came out on CD in the mid-eighties\, when that 
 technology reached indie labels.\nIn 1985 we started to listen to bands li
 ke Metallica & Slayer. Our second full length release Dealing with It\, sh
 owed a progression to the metal side of the music genre. This album also w
 as said to make an impact\, and helped start the crossover movement. “We
  fused together our influences\, and shoved into the DRI mold\, Dealing Wi
 th It is what came out”. DRI went on mixing its own brand of punk metal 
 releasing: Crossover\, Four of a Kind\, Thrash Zone\, Definition\, a live 
 album recorded in 1992\, before releasing Full Speed Ahead in 1996 \; our 
 last full length release. We have been re-issuing our old catalog with bon
 us tracks for the new millennium. We also got a bunch of Live DVD’s in t
 he works\, starting with the 1984 CBGB’s live DVD that came out in 2005.
  Summer of 2016 saw the release of the first new material in years. But Wa
 it..THERE’s MORE came out as a 7″/12″ and CD.\nThe band currently co
 nsists of original core members and song writing team\, Spike Cassidy (gui
 tar) and Kurt Brecht (vocals)\, along with Gregg Orr (bass) and Rob Rampy 
 (drums).We are that band with the skanker in the circle. You know\, the ru
 nning man. The mosher. We appeared on a Beavis & Butthead episode. We also
  held the Guinness Book record for fastest band in the world\, back in the
  day. We played with just about every major band you can name\, and most f
 estivals in our travels around the world for over three decades. We now ha
 ve over 120 DRI songs under our belt\, and still play about 35 or so when 
 we play live.\nHONEY (9:00 PM)Originally\, Honey wasn’t conceived as a f
 ull band project. It was more of a solo projectto serve as “therapy” f
 or singer / guitarist\, Jay Laughlin (Turning Point\, Godspeed). AsJay put
 s it\, “I’ve been playing in bands non-stop since the 8th grade (1986)
 . In 2017\, Ihad a couple of back-to-back shitty situations which put me i
 nto a seriously darkdepression. I thought maybe it was time to take a step
  back from playing in a band andbook some studio time to make a record for
  myself… by myself.” These sessions wouldtake Laughlin back to his roo
 ts — the heavy metal and hardcore music that first caughthis ear and pos
 sessed him to pick up a guitar and write songs in the first place.\n

 ng it\, the suits at GOD? Records demanded the opportunity to release it\,
  and the rest became irrevocable historical fact in 2014. That debut relea

  show 1000 Days (on Drag City). During this time\, Daniel left to focus 
 on raising his son\, and the remaining three members of Wand regrouped as 
 a trio\, with an auxiliary fourth piece for tours.\n \nFollowing a dizzyin
 g 100+ dates played in North America and Europe in support of 1000 Days\,
  Wand took a six-month deep breath at the beginning of 2016. Cory put toge
 ther a string laden solo album\, The Unknown Capitalist From Limbo (rele
 ased later that year)\, and Evan focused on writing and touring with his b
 and Behavior. Meanwhile\, Wand’s barely-perceptible pause had a deeper a
 genda—Evan\, Lee and Cory had sensed the need for a new alignment\, a fa
 bulous new mutation of the body Wand. Sofia Arreguin and Robbie Cody were 
 recruited to play keyboards and guitar respectively\, with the intention o
 f reimagining the band’s approach to writing and performance. A period o
 f intense woodshedding ensued\, both in the practice space and on stages a
 round the world\, out of which the records Plum and “Perfume” emer
 ged.\n \nThe writing process that evolved during the tumultuous seasons of
  Plum and “Perfume” incorporated a new emphasis on econo-jamming a
 nd democratic decision-making\; another new method of invention\, another 
 new mode of digestion. Plum dropped in the fall of 2017\, “Perfume”
  in the spring of 2018. With the success of this music\, the band forged 
 on with confidence\, stockpiling dozens of pieces and working them togethe
 r as a unit. They made the most of their 2018\, taking in deep bubbles of 
 time to tinker and experiment with their sound\, using several different s
 paces as well as their own home studio\, and patiently uncovering the exci
 ting alchemical balance that would bring all this work together as a whole
 . By the turn of autumn\, Wand had arrived at the width and breadth\, the 
 breathless wit of their new album—Laughing Matter.\n \nMAD ALCHEMIST LIQ

 9PM – Show\nWXPN Welcomes\n \nS.G. GOODMAN\n“No one escapes the marks 
 left behind when it comes to love or the absence of it\,” says singer-so
 ngwriter S.G. Goodman\, describing the inspiration behind her sophomore al
 bum Teeth Marks. “Not only are we the ones who bear its indentations\, b
 ut we’re also the ones responsible for placing them on ourselves and oth
 ers.”   When the Kentucky native released her debut album\, Old Time F
 eeling\, she was rightly coined an “untamed rock n roll truth-teller” 
 by Rolling Stone. The roots-inflected rock n’ roll record saw Goodman le
 nding her gritty\, haunting vocals to narrate the dual perspectives of her
  upbringing as the daughter of a crop farmer\, and a queer woman coming ou
 t in a rural town.  Now with Teeth Marks\, co-produced by Drew Vandenber
 g (Faye Webster\, Drive-By Truckers\, Of Montreal) in Athens\, Georgia\, s
 he picks up the threads of Old Time Feeling. But where her critically accl
 aimed\, Jim James-produced debut zeroed in on the South\, reframing miscon
 ceptions in slough water-soaked tones\, her latest album pulses with downt
 own Velvet Underground electricity\, shifting its focus inward – though 
 never losing Goodman’s searing and universal point of view. Teeth Marks 
 is what you might get if Flannery O’Connor and Lou Reed went on a road t
 rip.  Drawing influences from the aforementioned Velvets\, as well as Pa
 vement\, Karen Dalton\, and Chad VanGaalen\, Goodman brings 11 powerful vi
 gnettes to life\, with a sound that ventures deeper into indie rock and pu
 nk territory than she ever has before. Though Teeth Marks is a love album\
 , Goodman doesn’t aim her focus on romantic relationships alone. Instead
 \, she analyzes the way love between communities\, families\, and even one
 ’s self can be influenced by trauma that lingers in the body. Teeth Mark
 s is about what love actually is\, love’s psychological and physical imp
 rint\, its light\, and its darkness. It’s a record about the love we hav
 e or don’t have for each other\, and perhaps\, more significantly\, the 
 love we have or don’t have for ourselves. \n \nLE REN \n\n

 9PM – Show\n \nPORRIDGE RADIO\n \nPorridge Radio are one of the most vit
 al new voices in alternative music\, having gone from being darlings of th
 e DIY underground to one of the UK’s most thrilling bands in the space o
 f less than a year. Their barbed wit\, lacerating intensity and potent ble
 nd of art-rock\, indie-pop and post-punk sounds like little else around\, 
 and led their 2020 album Every Bad to make the nominees list for the covet
 ed Mercury Music Prize.\n \nFor frontperson Dana Margolin\, drummer Sam Ya
 rdley\, keyboardist Georgie Stott and bassist Maddie Ryall – who met in 
 the seaside town of Brighton and formed Porridge Radio in 2014 – global 
 recognition has been a long time coming\, after years of self-releasing an
 d music booking their own tours. In those eight years\, Dana has gained a 
 reputation as one of the most magnetic band leaders around with an ability
  to “devastate you with an emotional hurricane\, then blindside you with
  a moment of bittersweet humour” (NME). \n \nBut if Every Bad establish
 ed Dana’s lemon-sharp\, heart-on-sleeve honesty\, Porridge Radio’s thi
 rd album takes that to anthemic new heights. Waterslide\, Diving Board\, L
 adder To The Sky is the sound of someone in their late twenties facing dow
 n the disappointment of love\, and life\, and figuring out how to exist in
  the world\, without claiming any answers. It’s also catchy as hell.\nSE

 ndle of energy through a focused lens\, each song reminiscent of the stand
 out track on a gifted mix CD. \nAfter Sean returned home to suburban Conne
 cticut in 2019 (“New York had broken up with me”)\, he adopted a “re
 ligious 9 to 5” mentality: working on the record and listening to old hi
 p-hop and ‘90s alternative CDs in his car. “I was doing a lot of couch
  surfing\, living where I grew up in a Connecticut ghost town and touring 
 around the country. I was all over the place. Amidst trying to sort things
  out\, I wanted to make my version of a pop album.”\n

  \nBonny Doon emerged in 2014\, its four members pivoting away from their 
 punk origins to create something restrained and steeped in contemplation. 
 Songwriters Bill Lennox and Bobby Colombo expanded their ongoing collabora
 tion to include drummer Jake Kmiecik and bassist Joshua Brooks. From there
  Bonny Doon took form\, developing a sound indebted as much to musical tou
 chstones like Neil Young and the Silver Jews as it was to the emotional la
 ndscapes of their always changing hometown of Detroit.\n \nThe group recor
 ded what became a self-titled 7” in the summer of 2014\, tracked by Fred
  Thomas in his living room. A tape of 4-track demos\, “Classical Days an
 d Jazzy Nights\,” followed in 2015\, before reenlisting Thomas to record
  their texturally dense debut LP\, which melded their penchant for time-ho
 nored songcraft with production heavy on tape-delay and glowing\, roomy so
 nics. The album was released on Salinas in early 2017\, as the band was al
 ready deep into work on material for a follow-up. Working in a studio for 
 the first time\, they captured a more spare and vulnerable sound and signe
 d on with Woodsist to release the resultant album\, Longwave.\nTHE GOODBY
 E PARTY\n \nOver the last eight years\, the Goodbye Party has remained a 
 hidden gem to devoted fans. The music of Michael Cantor\, the Philadelphia
 -based musician behind the project\, has been a well-kept secret that hold
 s the sacredness of loss close to the heart through classic pop ballads\, 
 atmospheric soundscapes\, cassette tape noise\, swirling guitars\, and an 
 affinity for staying present in the dark corners of our minds. On October 
 9\, 2020\, the Goodbye Party will release their sophomore album\, Beautifu

 d of Cameron Lew\, who manages to not only be the figurehead of the projec
 t\, but also writes\, records\, produces\, directs\, and edits every aspec
 t of the project. While the nontraditional approach may have lead to a mor
 e gradual growth of the project it has resulted in Ginger Root gaining a d
 evoted fanbase.\n \nAfter releasing their sophomore album\, Rikki\, in 202
 0 with much of it feeling lost to the moments of that year Lew decided to 
 take a step back and try to write a succinct project to try and keep liste
 ners engaged for as long as possible. The result of this redirection of en
 ergy was paired with a newfound influence from Japanese art and culture af
 ter Lew immersed himself while learning to speak the language. All of this
  was packaged and delivered on City Slicker in 2021. \n \nWith this batch
  of songs Ginger Root finally saw his hard work pay off in a major way. Th
 e project connected with a massive audience on the internet\, and resulted
  in songs like Juban District and Loretta exploding. Ginger Root’s inter
 net presence grew steadily as well with his youtube amassing 160\,000 subs
 cribers and his Spotify nearly hitting 1 million monthly listeners. \n \n
 The path to success did not come overnight\, but rather at a gradual pace.
  The project delivered it’s first album in collaboration with Acrophase 
 Record\, Mahjong Room\, in 2018 and really has not stopped since. Between 
 each project Ginger Root has played alongside tons of modern Indie standou
 ts like Khruangbin\, Durand Jones\, Omar Apollo\, The Marias\, and Hippo C
 ampus to name a few. \n \nNow Ginger Root sets out to deliver a complimen
 tary EP and continue to captivate fans with his rich visuals and lush soun
 ds that he seemingly never fails to deliver. The project at times feels mo
 re aptly consumed on VHS rather than vinyl. Nisemono arrives in September 
 of 2022 along with their first headline tour in America.\nKING PARI (8:00)
 \n \nKing Pari is an almost accidental project. Cameron Kinghorn and DJ St
 epmom (Joe Christensen) didn’t even set out to start a band. When Joe te
 xted Cameron some jams whipped up on his tape machine\, Cameron hit him ba
 ck with\, “What is this? I want in.” Ten minutes before they first met
  up\, Joe built the loop for their first single\, ‘Sunshine\,’ which t
 hey then wrote on the spot in a flurry of collective inspiration. Now the 
 duo’s collection of work has grown\, amassing millions of streams\, radi
 o play\, shows across the US\, and a fan base growing rapidly.\nKing Pari 
 is much more than this serendipitous start though. The project is the culm
 ination of Joe and Cameron’s years of hard work in the Minneapolis scene
 . Their musical talents afforded them opportunities few have experienced\,
  from being invited to play shows at Prince’s Paisley Park by Prince him
 self to performing with Prince’s band New Power Generation. The two draw
  inspiration from the “no limits” nature of the Minneapolis sound\, pu
 shing it forward as they see it today.\n

  Two of Me\, which introduced the world to the symbiotic writing style and
  profound creative intuition of founders Etta Friedman and Allegra Weingar
 ten\, the band’s third studio album Household Name reveals an exciting n
 ew chapter marked by both personal and artistic growth. Now based in Brook
 lyn\, New York\, after relocating from hometown Los Angeles\, the duo upgr
 aded from GarageBand and took their time writing and recording in a proper
  studio alongside multi-instrumentalist/producer Aron Kobayashi Ritch and 
 drummer Zach CapittiFenton. The resulting album\, mastered by Grammy-winni
 ng engineer Emily Lazar\, is a tightly-stitched collection that is magneti
 c and dynamic\, and also marks their debut for Polyvinyl Record Co./Lucky 
 Number—who signed Momma in the midst of the pandemic before the band mem
 bers had even finished college. In chasing their idols and embracing perso
 nal storytelling\, the band has skillfully carved out their own path. Hous
 ehold Name showcases an unfettered vulnerability elevated by serious alt-r
 ock bombast\, and is an album that tells the world: This is Momma.\n \nwav

 Formed in New Brunswick\, NJ in 2005\, Screaming Females is Marissa Patern
 oster (guitar\, vox)\, Mike Abbate (bass)\, and Jarrett Dougherty (drums).
  Over six albums and more than a decade of music making\, the band has rem
 ained deeply individual and steadfastly DIY. They have also grown into one
  of the most dynamic and devastating touring bands going today.\nOut Febru
 ary 23rd\, All At Once is the trio’s most expansive and imaginative work
 s to date–a double LP that swings between surreal miniatures and solo-he
 avy sprawl. Concision takes a backseat to experimentation\, with arrangeme
 nts meant to evoke the energy and spontaneity of their live shows. It’s 
 music built across a timeline that’s longer than our internet-enhanced m
 oment typically tolerates and a testament to the band’s dedication and p
 erseverance.\nGHÖSH\n \nGhösh is a disco cabal\, a “political party”
  if you dig what we’re saying\, a band– they’re a wild sonic collage
 \, a quasi post-grunge\, post-industrial mash-up\, all wrapped up in the c
 haos and entropic funk of a warped and screwed Public Enemy demo tape and 
 a fax machine shredded in a Cuisinart. Their songs are an iridescent kind 
 of noisy digital alchemy layered in dense charging breakbeats and splatter
 ed in raucous dayglo\, laser-beamed transmissions from the future at the l
 ast protest march of the revolution. \nSymphony Spell (vocals/lyrics) and
  Zachary Fairbrother (various instruments/samplers)\, the two cyborgs that
  form Ghösh\, bonded over their love for jungle\, techno\, rap and nu met
 al to create songs that bang in tantric visions of sight and sound. Their 
 aesthetic is ripped from the screenshots of Republican nightmares and proj
 ected wide in shimmering hologram\, scored by the last dancefloor clearing
  sound blasts from a party on Cybertron\, all couched in the lyrical inten
 sity of a 2008 myspace page co-owned by Audre Lorde and Missy Elliot.\nTHE
  IREThe Ire is a post-punk group originating in Philadelphia\, started by
  guitarist Florence Lin in late 2017. Joined by Ashley Tini (drums)\, Maya
  Brooks (vocals)\, and Daniel Cox (bass)\, The Ire released their demo in
  early 2019\, and have since impressed audiences across the country with t
 heir romantic mixture of rage and passion\; packaged in the nostalgia of a
 n 80s goth and anarcho-punk sound. \n \n \n \nThe release of their debut 
 LP “What Dreams May Come” (June 6th on Play Alone Records) provides a 
 bridge from the early demos into a clear maturation of style and content\,
  as themes such as racial struggle\, societal collapse are echoed from ear
 ly recordings as well as more personal responses to the weight of our curr
 ent world. All coming together under a rallying cry of resistance that res
 onates defiantly with each track.\n\n\n\n\n

 were the biggest rock band in Zambia in the 1970s and spearheaded a new ge

  to Black Sabbath and James Brown and mixing them with traditional African
  rhythms and bush village songs. At t the peak of their popularity\, the b

  – whose name is an Africanisation of Mick Jagger’s – riled up crowd
 s by stage diving from balconies and dancing manically as the WITCH’s bl
 end of psychedelic rock and African rhythms permeated the surrounding atmo
 sphere.\n \nJagari is the charismatic sole surviving original member of th
 e band. As Zambia’s economy stagnated and the country buckled under the 
 AIDS crisis\, WITCH fell apart. Jagari retreated to a life of quasi-anonym
 ity as a university music professor before being wrongfully arrested durin
 g Zambia’s toughest hour. Now a man in his 60s\, he spends his time mini
 ng gemstones hoping to strike it rich\, until very recently the band being
  just a nostalgic memory of his youth.\n \nLargely unknown outside of thei
 r home country\, WITCH finally got the exposure they deserved when Now Aga
 in Records reissued their entire discography in 2012. This allowed Jagari 
 to play outside Africa for the first time and for a new generation of fans
  to discover his music. In 2016 he began a collaboration with Dutch musici
 ans Jacco Gardner and Nic Mauskoviç\, and together with them\, in Septemb

 track experiments quickly took on a life of their own as Pedrum began dist
 illing his musical and lyrical inspirations into something both timeless a
 nd new. His miniature menagerie of light-psych and proto-punk gems had out
 grown their cassette cage and were now ready to be heard.\nPAINT’s epony
 mous debut (Mexican Summer\, 2018) appeared out of the ether\, fully forme
 d. It was praised for its originality and drew favorable comparisons to th
 e likes of Kevin Ayers\, Lou Reed and Julian Cope. The mess was the messag
 e and the decidedly mid-fi production found Siadatian both honoring and es
 chewing tradition. The album was accompanied by videos for the singles “
 Daily Gazette” and “Moldy Man\,” both directed by Sam Kristofski (Co

 eclaring that the music industry needed more happy songs. As Martin Earley
  and Calin Peters recall\, they laughed while reading it\, knowing that th
 eir work as The Ballroom Thieves explores the spirit of that paradigm. Wel
 l\, sort of…they’re not interested in easily defined worldviews.\n \n
 “We read that article and thought\, ‘how are we supposed to write happ
 y songs right now?'” says Earley. “We don’t write happy songs\, but 
 this time we decided to try something new by pairing optimistic sounding m
 usic with dark lyrics. If the listener is not a lyrics person\, they might
  not notice.”\n \nThe Ballroom Thieves’ fourth album\, Clouds\, is a 
 song cycle born of mixed experiences and fueled by the power of imaginatio
 n. The album is a lush meditation on longing to return to touring – to
  see different sunsets and cities. But\, it’s also a reflection of its d
 ifficulties\, e.g.\, insomnia brought on by sleeping in different hotel ro
 oms every night. After a major car accident and the departure of a band me

 n\, skateboarder\, infamous Blink182 stan—will tell you\, “I’m alway
 s gonna be the one whose mom called him ‘the Golden One\,’ right befor
 e she died.” This is where his debut HBO comedy special\, The Golden One
 \, finds Whitmer: age thirty\, investigating this sense (curse?) of destin
 y-as-identity. It’s been thirteen years since he left Alabama for LA\, b
 ecoming a linchpin for LA’s young\, independent comedy scene with Power 
 Violence\, the monthly show he hosted with friends. But he became haunted 
 by the question: had he already peaked\, just like his mom\, singer in a l
 ocal band with big ambitions that never made it out of the Flora-Bama Loun
 ge in Gulf Shores? Rather than shy away from all that messy self-mythology
 \, Whitmer tapped the source of it all through writing this one-man show f
 eaturing his own original music. Songs from The Golden One\, a companion a
 lbum of songs from the special\, features Whitmer’s darkwave bangers\, s
 ynthesizing relatable-content: millennial anxieties\, therapy-speak jokes\
 , and the annals of his own childhood tragedies.\n \nAL MENNE (9:00 PM)\n 
 \nAl Menne has a voice unlike any other. Soft and emotional with lyrical i
 ntimacy that callsback to Transatlanticism-era Death Cab for Cutie\, fitti
 ng as they both share the samePacific Northwest roots. Now based in Los An
 geles by way of Seattle\, Al has spent thelast eight years as the lead sin
 ger of Indie-Rock band Great Grandpa. In-betweenresponsibilities with Grea

 e’s gonna sing. But the sun shining through the branches— are those ra
 ys yellow or hazy gray? What day is today? When are you not going to feel 
 this way again?\n“Hello\, Hi”: welcome in to a new room to play the st
 yles and feels that lie under Ty Segall’s fingers\, easing fresh air int
 o acoustic space with an assortment of love songs flowering in righteous u
 nconsciousness. Plaintive and wistful\, but unafraid. Like rain washing aw
 ay yesterday\, “Hello\, Hi” pushes open the door\, inviting the new to
  pass through all the old shades and degrees of hot and cold. Dark paths t
 urn off abruptly into absurd darkness\, then wind back through the broken 
 rocks\, ecstatic again. Absurdity again. It happens everyday.\n“Hello\, 
 Hi” is expansively rendered by Ty\, mostly by himself\, at home. The iso
 lation suits the songs: you’re only ever as “at home” as you are wit
 h yourself in the mirror. Ty’s acoustic and electric guitars and vocal h
 armonies layer self upon self\, forming a spiny backbone for the album. Te
 xtures at once gentle and dissonant root the songs as they make their move
 : melodic arcs convulsing in doubt and bliss and rage. Busting out of the 
 endless gridlock into open space\, these spirits pass on through.\n“Hell
 o\, Hi”’s flickering awakening to this trip: the opening three tracks
 ’ train of sweet and salty reflections\, before the abrupt crunch of the
  title track electrifies the senses. Good morning’s turned to good mourn
 ing in nothing flat\, but there’s still a way up from the doldrums\, to 
 try again. Why can’t it be just as simple as “Hello\, Hi”? What to d
 o with yourself when love triggers loathing? How many more times do you ha
 ve to go back there again? Pulling at the scratchy wool threads of an old 
 sweater favored for warmth\, comfort\, protection\, rejection\, denial\, b
 lindness etc\, Ty Segall dives from a clear\, open sky\, down through the 
 marine layer and the shimmering waves of all the years.\nRadiating from th
 e same mind fields as Goodbye Bread and Sleeper\, mixed with shard edges o
 f contrast and contradiction from things like Freedom’s Goblin\, Manipul
 ator\, and First Taste\, “Hello\, Hi” is Ty’s most relaxed and compl
 ete production to date\, an ebb-and flow fusion of words and music offerin
 g abstraction and acceptance as it wrestles itself through a fucked-up tim
 e. Your life and what you make of it — throughout “Hello\, Hi\,”
  Ty Segall charts a passage through its enduring tangles honestly\, with c
 larity and confusion. \n

 lso of Black Country\, New Road) met Taylor at the Guildhall School Of Mus
 ic & Drama where they were studying jazz and electronic composition respec
 tively. Generally speaking their modus operandi has been to produce a viol
 ently spatially and temporally disrupted form of pop music which sometimes
  sees them gleefully break apart existing styles only to expertly reassemb
 le them and other times sees them mint entirely fresh genres. Both of them
  grew up playing and loving classical music and picked up a bug for jazz i
 n college\, but their other shared interests include Disclosure and Mica L
 evi\, with Taylor having a penchant for Bob Dylan\, and Georgia for Joni M
 itchell. They have released a clutch of singles\, EPs and a mixtape over t
 he last five years\, already giving rise to something of a press narrative
 : Georgia sings a classic pre-rock & roll orchestral lounge pop song while
  Taylor forces it through a post-dubstep blender\, mixing old with new.\nB
 ut their debut LP\, I Love You Jennifer B\, blasts that simplistic reducti
 onism to smithereens. Releasing in the Fall of 2022\, Georgia and Taylor s
 aid: “I Love You Jennifer B is a collection of Jockstrap tracks that hav
 e been 3 years in the making. Everything on it is pretty singular sounding
  so we hope there is a track on there for everyone and something that spea
 ks to you and says ‘I’m a banger.’”\nMuch has been made recently o
 f the resurgence in interest in the song ‘Running Up That Hill (A Deal W
 ith God)’ via its appearance on the Stranger Things 4 soundtrack but Joc
 kstrap are the only young artists in the UK (both are 24) who currently ha
 ve the same vision for bending classic pop into wonderful new shapes that 
 Kate Bush had during the mid-80s. Jockstrap effortlessly capture the chaos
 \, joy\, uncertainty\, intrigue\, pain and romance of 2022 like no other.\

 PM – Show\nAOIFFE NESSA FRANCES\nIn spring of 2020\, Aoife Nessa Frances
  moved out of the city for the first time in her life. After packing up he
 r things in Dublin\, she moved to rural County Clare on the west coast of 
 Ireland\, and there\, amidst the stillness\, she worked on the songs that 
 would become her second album\, Protector. The resulting body of work deft
 ly juxtaposes golden hours and arguments\, affection and alienation\, and 
 above all marks a crucial period of her life that was transformative and l
 eft her wiser.\n \n“I might have been running away from my problems\,”
  she admits. “I was disconnected from myself and from nature\, but I fou
 nd peace far away from the city\, where there were no distractions. I isol
 ated myself with nothing to do but make music.” Writing Protector provid
 ed Frances an essential sounding board for this journey. “I felt a growi
 ng inner strength that guided me through the making of this album. It was 
 like sculpting with my eyes closed\, this intense sense of self-preservati
 on leading me and growing with each song I wrote. When I started\, I didn
 ’t recognise myself. With each song\, I became more human.”\n \nAoife 
 spent that summer with her dad and two sisters. “It was a very special t
 ime for my family as we had never been that tight knit before\,” she say
 s\, “and we all became very close…driving the country roads and swimmi
 ng in the Atlantic Ocean and lakes of Clare. I had one CD in my car: Jim S
 ullivan’s UFO and we listened to it over and over again.” Like many pe
 ople in their late twenties shaking off youthful rebelliousness\, Frances 
 experienced a solidification of familial ties like never before\, and felt
  the formation of a protective\, impenetrable shell. “For me\, Protector
  acknowledges the part of myself that steers me towards a brighter path. T
 he almost psychotropic power of nature gave me a connection I never felt b
 efore. As the countryside seeped into me and lines of communication opened
  up with my family\, I developed an ability to perceive myself and my choi
 ces within an expanded world.”\nINDIGO SPARKE\n \n“To be at the edge\,
  at the precipice of anything\, requires deep surrender. It’s like dying
  over and over again. In the tidal throes of life at its fullest and most 
 intense is the space where grace and strength is fortified and cultivated\
 , is what I am learning” Indigo Sparke ruminates on her magnetic second 
 full-length album Hysteria\, a huge and beautiful sweeping work\, one that
  possesses a rare\, reflective power. From the first few notes\, in the fi
 rst song\, Blue\, something chilling and captivating pierces straight into
  the listener’s chest. With harmonies reminiscent of the voices in our h
 eads\, she examines love\, loss\, grief\, a newly realized rage\, her hist
 ory\, dreams\, and the emotional weather patterns surrounding those sensat
 ions: her words tell the stories\, and the sounds act them out. It’s a d
 iary built for big stages. ‘Hysteria’ arrives just a year after her st
 riking\, minimalist debut\, Echo. Here though\, Sparke offers an expansive
  body of work—it’s a simultaneously nostalgic yet clear and complex co
 llection that expands her sound and outlook. \n
