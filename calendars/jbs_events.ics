 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \nQUASI\n \nBreaking the Balls of History 
 is Quasi’s tenth record\, landing ten years after their last record\, on
  February tenth. Three tens\, which aligns with the thirty years they’ve
  played together. Sam Coomes and Janet Weiss have become Pacific Northwest
  icons\, and Quasi has always felt so steadfast— their enduring friendsh
 ip so generative\, their energy infinite\, each album more raucous and cat
 chy and ferocious and funny than the last. But we were wrong to ever take 
 Quasi for granted. For a while\, they thought 2013’s intricate Mole City
  might be their last record. They’d go out on a great one and move on. T
 hen in August 2019 a car smashed into Janet’s and broke both legs and he
 r collarbone. Then a deadly virus collided with all of us\, and no one kne
 w when or if live music as we knew it—the touring\, the communal crowds\
 , the sonic church of the dark club—would ever happen again. “There’
 s no investing in the future anymore\,” Janet realized. “The future is
  now. Do it now if you want to do it. Don’t put it off. All those things
  you only realize when it’s almost too late. It could be gone in a secon
 d.”Under lockdown\, Portland’s streets fell still\, airplanes vanished
 \, wildlife emerged. And with the obliterated normal came an unexpected gi
 ft: uninterrupted time\, hours every day\, to make art. Quasi couldn’t g
 o on the road\, so they got an idea: they would act as if they were on tou
 r and play together every single day. Each afternoon\, Sam and Janet bunke
 red down in their tinypractice space and channeled the bewilderment and ab
 surdity of this alien new world into songs. Janet’s strength returned an
 d rose to athlete-level stamina. “When you’re younger and in a band\, 
 you make records because that’s what you do\,” Sam said. “But this t
 ime\, the whole thing felt purposeful in a way that was unique to the circ
 umstances.” They knew they would keep it to just the two of them playing
  together in a room. They knew they’d record the songs live and together
 \, to capture a moment.The incredible result of those sessions is Breaking
  the Balls of History\, recorded in five days and produced by John Goodman
 son at the legendary Robert Lang Studios in Shoreline\, WA. Here are two a
 rtists at their prime\, each a human library of musical knowledge and expe
 rience\, entirely distinctive in their songcraft and sound. In Quasi-form\
 , the band becomes alchemically even greater than the sum of its parts: Ja
 net’s galloping drums and Sam’s punk-symphonic Rocksichord and their i
 ntertwining vocals make something gigantic\, anthemic.\nBAT FANGS\n\n \nBo
 rn of a shared love of hair metal\, partying\, and the reckless spirit of 
 rock and roll\, Washington D.C./ Carborro\, NC duo Bat Fangs brings a fier
 y combination of shredderistic guitars and heavily harmonized hooks.  Gui
 tarist/vocalist Betsy Wright (Ex Hex) and drummer Laura King (Mac McCaugha
 n\, Speed Stick) united after playing a show together in their respective 
 projects\, with the goal of pushing Wright’s pop focused songwriting in 
 a bolder\, brasher direction. Taking up the primary songwriting role and s
 hifting to guitar\, Wright steps outside of the typical Ex Hex sound with 
 Bat Fangs’ rowdy rock.\n

 ors8PM – Show\nTIM BARRY\n \nAnd so begins “Ain’t Much For Talking\,
 ” the opening salvo on Tim Barry’s latest album\, Spring Hill. In a fa
 shion that can only be called “perfectly Tim Barry\,” the line carries
  with it some rather immense weight and rather eloquently and succinctly s
 ets the table for what’s in store\, both on the remainder of the song an
 d on the album as a whole. If you’re expecting a baker’s dozen tales o
 f introspection and honest reflection and occasional pointed-tongued humor
  and a handful of lines that’ll punch you right square in the solar plex
 us\, you’ve come to the right place.\nJOSH SMALL\n \nJosh Small was born
  in Falls Church\, Virginia on the day Mt. St. Helens erupted. Now\, he wo
 uld tell you that a person’s perception of chaos is just as interesting 
 and important as the chaos itself. And I would add that a person’s upbri
 nging-their collective experiences\, the things they never talk about\, an
 d the songs they stomp out together on the porch-determines the landscape 
 of a life. Josh Small is the child of the first non-traveling generation i
 n a family of gypsies and in his songwriting he captures what seems to be 
 the collective memory of all the transience leading up to his life. He pul
 ls from a legacy of tall tales\, extreme loyalty\, and bizarre collections
  to develop layered\, diverse stories in which he plays the protagonist. T
 he wily singer with the worn-through boot soles manages to capture a trave
 ling narrative reminiscent of the bard\, the ballad of a weary lover\, and
  the “by hook or by crook” self- indulgence of a real rock n’ roller
 .\nSALLY ROSE\n \nWith her first solo album in a decade\, Sally Rose is ge
 tting back to her Americana roots. But don’t worry\, she’s still a roc
 k n’ roll riot grrrl at heart — and she’s bringing some much needed 
 queer femme representation to the world of country music.\n \n-RVA MAGAZIN

  – Show\nTHE MESSTHETICS\n \nThe last time drummer Brendan Canty and bas
 sist Joe Lally were in a band together\, they were the rhythmic architects
  for Fugazi\, an organization whose decade and a half of disciplined progr
 essivism provided a necessary bridge between the zenith of late-punk expre
 ssion and everything alternative in rock that followed. In 2016\, the two 
 were enlisted by guitarist Anthony Pirog in a conspiracy to subvert and re
 imagine the power trio\, bringing fully into the 21st Century a form that 
 may have reached near perfection with Hendrix’s Band of Gypsys on the ve
 ry first day of the 1970s.\nWith a self-titled recording scheduled for rel
 ease in the Spring of 2018 on Dischord\, the Messthetics will widen the re
 ach of a decisive instrumental music that so far\, they have only shared w
 ith a privileged handful of east coast and southern audiences. Across its 
 eight original compositions and one cover\, Anthony guides the sound throu
 gh complex changes and harmonic densities that might compound\, but never 
 confound or muddy its connection with the listener’s body. Recorded by B
 rendan in their practice space\, the group’s debut gives Anthony ample o
 pportunities to swap guitar textures and styles as freely as an octopus ch
 anges patterns.\n \n— Dr. Thomas Stanley (aka Bushmeat Sound)\nJAMES BRA
 NDON LEWIS TRIO\nI would think James would have a personal reference for s
 uch a title as Eye of I\, the poetic ululation of the trio of words\, not 
 unlike the sound of this particular human trio of music messengers. To my 
 mind\, Eye of I is in reference to a focus\, and a focus which is not enti
 rely disciplinarian but one infused with the spiritual. Having played a ti
 ny bit with James at a loose session some years back\, I felt the sound of
  meditation\, prayer\, and thoughtfulness in both a search and an acceptan
 ce of vibratory creative impulse. We just went into an elemental wave of s
 onics as a free thought recognition of peace and bliss in concordance with
  all the wild conflict this universe has in both its real world and dreams
 cape. The music went outside of any physical construct of time\, space and
  judgment\, feeling perfectly imperfect as a cosmologic unification of ope
 n-hearted love.\nJames’ compositions are at once the sole realizations o
 f his own “living music” concepts\, the aura of actually “seeing” 
 the music as it is conjured and gifted from the composer’s mind\, spirit
 \, and body\, as well as being defined to a profound degree by the interac
 tion of players James finds himself compatriot to. The JBL Trio on Eye Of 
 I is James on tenor\, cellist Christopher Hoffman and percussionist Max Ja
 ffe—augmented on two tracks by the guest appearance of cornetist Kirk Kn
 uffke\, and joined on a third by Anthony Pirog\, Brendan Canty. and Joe La
 lly of The Messthetics—players who have been on the scene\, and who are 
 obviously in the mix for JBL as these serious soul serenaders are not afra
 id to dig in hard to the dynamics being proffered\, always allowing a soph
 istication to present a sentient\, sometimes placid (with youngblood rambu
 nction\, underlying and playful) groove\, a groove dealing with intellect 
 as natural guidance—music reflecting the masters and finding its own com
 munitarian grace.\n— Thurston Moore\, 2022 London\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nTOLEDOFor Jordan Dunn–Pilz and 
 Dan Alvarez\, Toledo isn’t just their band\, it’s a way to blend their
  minds together and become one. “Individually\, we’re a mess\,” says
  Alvarez. “But as a pair\, our strongest qualities reveal themselves.”
  Lifelong friends\, Alvarez is the wildcard and Dunn–Pilz\, the sensible
  one. On their new EP Jockeys of Love — co–produced and mixed by Jorge
  Elbrecht (Wild Nothing\, Frankie Rose) — the duo have mind–melded yet
  again to create a soundtrack for those long drives when the entire world 
 seems to be in harmony with you\, and your thoughts seem monumental becaus
 e of it. The EP strikes a perfect balance of light and dark\; its lyrics c
 over heavier matters like relationship issues\, anxiety\, depression\, and
  alcoholism\, while the music retains a sense of better days just around t
 he corner. You can hear almost the entire emotional spectrum spread across
  these six songs\, but its prevailing emotion is hope. \nANOTHER MICHAEL
 ‘New Music and Big Pop’ is Another Michael’s most collaborative work
  yet. Recorded in a small A-frame house-turned-makeshift studio outside Fe
 rndale\, NY\, the record finds the trio pushing their sound in a dreamier\
 , more folk-influenced direction\, building songs around vulnerable\, inti
 mate performances using an ethereal palette of breezy guitars\, subtle key
 boards\, and layered harmonies. As on the band’s early EPs\, singer and 
 songwriter Michael Doherty’s mesmerizing voice is front and center here\
 , calling to mind Robin Pecknold or Ben Bridwell in its reedy\, crystallin
 e timbre\, but it feels more at home than ever before amidst the album’s
  lush\,Technicolor landscape.\nANNA SHOEMAKERPraised as “Brooklyn’s ow
 n Olivia Rodrigo” by NYLON. Following the release of her debut full-leng
 th Everything is Fine (I’m Only on Fire)\, Anna has quickly emerged as t
 he next indie-pop darling to watch. Combining alt-leaning production\, int
 oxicating pop melodies\, and notably honest lyricism\, her songs capture t
 he turmoil\, charm\, and introspection of young adulthood. \n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nKING TUFF\n \nThere are times in 
 our life when we feel magic in the air. When new love arrives\, or we find
 ourselves lost in a moment of creation with others who share our vision. A
  sense that: this iswho I want to be. This is what I want to share.It’s 
 a fleeting feeling and one that Kyle Thomas\, the singer-songwriter who re
 cords andperforms as King Tuff\, found himself longing for in the spring o
 f 2020.But knowing he couldn’t simply recreate this time in his life at 
 will\, Thomas—who hails fromBrattleboro\, Vermont—set out to write a l
 ove letter to those cherished moments of inspirationand to the small town 
 that formed him. The one where he first nurtured his songwritingimpulses\,
  bouncing ideas off other like-minded artists. The kind of place where the
  changing ofthe seasons always delivered a sense of perspective and fresh 
 artistic inspiration. Where he felta deeper connection with nature and sen
 se of community that had once been so close at hand.\n \n“I wanted to ma
 ke an album to remind myselfthat life is magical\,” he reflects.And so\,
  Thomas seized upon his memories\, creating what he calls “an album abou
 t love andnature and youth.”The result isSmalltown Stardust\, a spiritua
 l\, tender and ultimately joyous record that mightcome as a shock to those
  with only a passing knowledge of the artist’s back catalog. OnSmalltown
  Stardust\, Thomas takes us on his journey to a place where past and prese
 nt collide\,where he can be a dreamer in love with all that he sees. Image
 s of his youth abound: fromRoute 91 which runs through his hometown (in 
 “Smalltown Stardust”)\; to Redtooth\, a spectrewho used to roam the st
 reets (“Bandits Of Blue Sky”)\; to old friends\, old haunts and old dr
 eams(“Always Find Me”)\; to Vermont’s Rock River\, which gave its na
 me toa song of a torch stillburning for past love: “Those days are gone 
 and we can’t rewind/ Cuz people grow and placeschange/ But my love for y
 ou will never fade away.\nTCHOTCHKE\nNew York-based trio\, Tchotchke relea
 ses the ‘50s-inspired music video for their single “Wish You Were a Gi
 rl” following the release of their self-titled debut album. The video\, 
 which stars band members Anastasia\, Eva\, and Emily as distraught runaway
 -brides and housewives\, is a statement on rejecting traditional feminine 
 ideologies. “The entire video plays with this fictitious smokey dollhous
 e world where the band runs away from all feminine responsibilities and fo
 rced ideologies\,” director Ambar Navarro shares.  Throughout “Wish Y
 ou Were a Girl\,” we see the trio trapped within the confines of heteron
 ormativity\, and as it progresses\, we see them grow increasingly frustrat
 ed\, leading to their eventual escape from these age-old ideologies. \n

 ’Aïr (or “stars of the Aïr region”) welcomes you to Agadez\, the c
 apital city of Saharan rock. Playing for over 25 years\, Etran has emerged
  as stars of the local wedding circuit. Beloved for their dynamic repertoi
 re of hypnotic solos and sun schlazed melodies\, Etran stakes out a place 
 for Agadez guitar music. Playing a sound that invokes the desert metropoli
 s\, “Agadez” celebrates the sounds of all the dynamism of a hometown w
 edding. Etran is a family band composed of brothers and cousins\, all born
  and raised in the small neighborhood of Abalane\, just in the shadow of t
 he grand mosque. Sons of nomadic families that settled here in the 1970s f
 leeing the droughts\, they all grew up in Agadez. The band was formed in 1
 995 when current band leader Moussa “Abindi” Ibra was only 9 years old
 . Whereas other Tuareg guitarists look to Western rock\, Etran de L’Aïr
  play in a pan-African style that is emblematic of their hometown\, citing
  a myriad of cultural influences\, from Northern Malian blues\, Hausa bar 
 bands\, to Congolese Soukous. It’s perhaps this quality that makes them 
 so beloved in Agadez. “We play for the Tuareg\, the Toubou\, the Zarma\,
  the Hausa\,” Abindi explains. “When you invite us\, we come and play.
 ” Their music is rooted in celebration\, and invokes the exuberance of a
 n Agadez wedding\, with an overwhelming abundance of guitars\, as simultan
 eous solos playfully pass over one another with a restrained precision\, f
 orceful yet never overindulgent. \nEMILY ROBB\nEmily Robb is a Philadelph
 ia based musician who has been part of the rock and experimental scenes fo
 r over a decade.  Her bands have included Lantern\, Louie Louie\, Astute 
 Palate and most recently Refrigerator Mouth. While her collaborations are 
 extensive\, she also focuses on making solo electric guitar music. Her pl
 aying is unbounded\, surging within its own stratosphere\, and distinctive
 ly rock in heritage. 2021’s How To Moonwalk\, Emily’s debut solo a

 ir debut album Topical Dancer. The Ghent-based duo\, who broke out with th
 eir 2019 Zandoli EP on Soulwax’s record label DEEWEE\, are rare storytel
 lers in electronic music: they take the temperature of the time and funnel
  them into their playful synth concoctions – never didactic and always w
 ith a knowing wink.\n \nTheir new studio record – which cements them as 
 a duo under both their names for the first time and is co-written and co-p
 roduced by Soulwax – is both a triumph of kaleidoscopic electro-pop and 
 “a snapshot of how we think about pop culture in the 2020s.” It captur
 es Charlotte and Bolis’s essence as musical collaborators and the conver
 sations they’ve had over the past two years on tour\, as well as their p
 erspectives as Belgians with an immigrant background\, Charlotte with Guad
 eloupean and French-Martinique ancestry and Bolis being of Chinese descent
 .\n \nConceptually\, the pair wanted to put these observations and ideas a
 bout culture today and the zeitgeist into a “time capsule shaped like an
  egg”\, with the idea that you could “bury the album somewhere”\, sa
 ys Bolis\, for future generations to find and figure out what the 2020s we
 re all about through their eyes. The egg is “a visual shorthand\,” the
 y say\, “for new life and unhatched potential.”\n \nZandoli was partly
  an exploration of what it means to be a woman of Caribbean heritage growi
 ng up in Belgium – Pitchfork called it “striking\, playful electro pop
  with a sly sense of humour”. Topical Dancer\, however\, expands their w
 orldview outwards. Songs like “Hey” question the shallowness of ‘wok
 eness’ and searches for a utopia of “equality\, harmony and integrity
 ”\, while ‘Reappropriate’ is a fluttery R&B-ish song about liberatin
 g oneself from sexual trauma. Charlotte sings across English\, Dutch\, Cre
 ole and French\, her signature deadpan delivery at times recalling a vogue
  house vocalist or a Black Mirror-style virtual assistant\, giving the alb
 um a hypnotic\, fourth-world quality.\n

 ting somewhere between the nihilistic detachment of shoegaze and the emoti
 onal honesty of folk songwriting. They’ve made a slow and careful shift 
 from being the solo bedroom recording project of songwriter\, Tj Strohmer\
 , to a collaborative\, production-focused studio-recorded band. Through th
 eir ever-expanding genre palette\, range of fidelities\, and a long list o
 f collaborators runs a unique mood that ties everything together.Informed 
 by his experiences living in Philadelphia and their contrast with his rura
 l southern Maryland upbringing\, Strohmer’s sometimes straightforward\, 
 sometimes dreamlike lyrics feature scenes of darkness from many different 
 aspects of life. He deals with themes of death\, drugs\, heartbreak\, abus
 e\, and self-destruction\, all expressed through an androgynous vocal styl
 e\, which\, combined with the band’s lush\, often dense orchestral instr
 umentation gives a beautiful lightness to the heavy subject matter.Knifepl
 ay has earned a dedicated cult following since their 2017 debut with their
  home-recorded Eps\, acclaimed debut album Pearlty (2019)\, a lengthy B-S
 ides Compilation (2020)\, and an EP Hurt Someone (2021 Born Losers Recor

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nWORRIERS\n \nLauren Denitzio has 
 always been the type of songwriter to say exactly what’s on their mind. 
 Over the course of the past decade with their band Worriers\, they’ve ad
 dressed gender liberation\, capitalist violence\, and searing heartbreak\,
  allover the band’s signature style of triumphant chords and subtle pop 
 sensibilities. Worriers was always a band that shined with the feelings of
  ecstatic potential\; offering a sense of liberation amidst the chaos of t
 he world. And yet\, on their newest album Warm Blanket\, they’ve never s
 ounded more free.The band’s fourth full length record has the feel of an
  exciting debut and there’s a reason: it marks the first time that Denit
 zio accepted that the group they had been trying to treat as a band is act
 ually a solo project. After a pace of touring and recording that would be 
 breakneck for most\, but derigueur in the underground scene which forged t
 hem\, Denitzio found themselves in the summer of 2022 with a chance to fin
 ally catch their breath. “I realized I could write whatever I wanted.”
 The DIY ethic that Denitzio developed on a thousand punk tours\, playing s
 quats\, house parties and rowdy warehouses is never far from their mode of
  operation. And so—with no proper training in audio recording—they rec
 orded and mixed the entirety of Warm Blanket at home. Atom Willard (Agains
 t Me!\, Social Distortion) contributed drums remotely\, adding an orchestr
 al element of weight and emphasis to the proceedings.The result is a colle
 ction of songs that reflects Denitizio “unlearning the expectations of b
 eing in a band” and writing music “that’s more in line with my actua
 l influences.” Written during a particularly fertile creative period—D
 enitzio had already completed an entirely separate new album to be release
 d later—Warm Blanket marked a chance to write the kind of songs they had
  always appreciated but were unsure of how to place in the Worriers catalo
 g.\n \n \n \nLIZDELISE \n \nPhiladelphia band Lizdelise has garnered loc
 al acclaim since their inception in 2014. LDL released their newest track 
 “WMN” June 7th in anticipation of their first North American tour– a
  queer ballad\, full of fear and joy\, and the feeling of running to catch
 -up with yourself. The experimental pop band recorded “WMN” at Betty
 ’s in Chapel Hill\, NC\, with Andy Stack (Wye Oak\, Joyero\, Helado Negr
 o). For fans of…dynamic\, genre-bending range like NNAMDI\, shredding gu
 itar and dreamy vocals like St. Vincent\, darkness and strength like Sharo
 n Van Etten.\nBEST BEARBest Bear is all about understated indie-rock\, eth
 ereal dream-pop textures\, and heartfelt lyrics. At times lush and oneiric
 \, at others raw and unapologetic\, the band’s songs feel like a genuine
  portrait of the member’s life-long love of music. However\, there is al
 so an inclusive\, community-driven element at play. Connecting with the au
 dience and other artists drives the mindset of the band\, which proudly id
 entifies with the LGBTQIA+ community and values. Fans of artists such as P
 hoebe Bridgers\, The Beths\, Soccer Mommy\, or Pinegrove should definitely
  tune in!\n \n \n \n \n

  Who has time to read this in 2022? With all that’s happening? With thes

 hink it’s a good thing. Listen to the music\, come to a show\, think for
  yourself. The best compliment I ever received was when someone told me th
 ey can never tell when I am serious. My two biggest fears are opposites 
 — having a child or killing someone. You’re probably a little confused
  or annoyed\, but at least you’re not asleep. That’s kind of my thing.
  I bet you made it this far. Success!!!\nWe have all been through a lot. E
 specially the last few years but also all the years before that. There was
  never time to collectively stop and question what has been considered “
 normal” for so long and it turns out nothing really is. These ways of th
 inking and doing in America were never serving everyone but now they’re 
 not serving anyone (except maybe 5 guys that all look identical and own ev
 erything). So\, I spent an entire record trying to understand what is happ
 ening\, what’s wrong with this place and what’s wrong with myself\, it
 ’s called “FOREGROUND MUSIC” and it’s going to come out on legenda
 ry label\, Kill Rock Stars\, on 3/3/23.\nJOHN ROSEBORO\nBrooklyn\, New Yor

 ghout the pandemic\, Jane Fitzsimmons & Ian Jones self-converted their Dod
 ge Promaster Tour-Van into a full-time\, doomsday mobile-home\; complete w

  with their own four hands. Living in it full-time since February of 2021\
 , 20 songs were written\; 15 recorded\, and 10 chosen for their post-pande
 mic proclamation. The songs are beautifully evocative\, political without 
 being patronizing or pandering\, and widespread in their diversity of soun
 ds & emotions. Title track “One Stop Shop (For A Fading Revolution)” i
 s a propulsive overture for the end times\, while “HaHaHome”\, the alb
 um’s lead single- is an ode to brit-pop with a Stone-roses-esque basslin
 e that could even make Paul McCartney jealous. “Brooklyn Bridge” showc
 ases the duo’s ability to craft metaphorically complex lyrics that are s
 imultaneously immediate because of the heartfelt prosody of Fitzsimmons’
  vocals- vocals that until now\, would’ve seemed out of twen’s former 
 wheelhouse as “indie-psych-rockers”. On “Feeling In Love (From the W
 aist Down)” and “Sweet Dreams (In the Parking Lot)” they make good o
 n their promise to ‘never write the same song twice’. Important\; cons
 idering how many bands in the cultural sphere get by as one-trick ponies.\
 n \nIn addition\, twen have solidified a 5 piece line-up\, consisting of M
 erideth Hanscom on bass guitar\, Asher Horton on guitar\, and Luke Fedorko
  on drums. To show it all off\, the band will be headlining 2 NYC shows at

  twen are proving to be among the most original\, hardworking and authenti
 c American rock bands today. Not because they are tiktok viral\, or posing
  in decades-cosplay and attempting to draw you in by preying on your rock-
 n-roll nostalgia\, but because they are writing great songs\, traveling th
 e country in a van they built themselves\, self-producing their own art\, 
 screenprinting their own merch\, and doing it their way\, all against the 
 backdrop of the apocalypse. That image can’t be crafted by a team\, and 
 just as has always been the case\, that freedom is what rock n’ roll rea

 , and silent knights\, POISON RUIN stab at the pulsing heart of what it me
 ans to live under the permanent midnight of contemporary life. With Harves
 t\, the band aligns their sonic palette to their godless\, medieval-inflec
 ted aesthetic symbolism\, creating a record which strikes with an assured 
 sense of blackened harmony.\n“I’ve always found fantasy tropes to be i
 ncredibly evocative\,” vocalist Mac Kennedy notes\, “that said\, even 
 though they are a set of symbols that seem to speak to most people of our 
 generation\, they are often either apolitical or co-opted for incredibly b
 ackwards politics.”\nKennedy reworks fantasy imagery as a series of tote
 ms for the downtrodden\, stripping it of its escapist tendencies and retoo
 ling it as a rich metaphor for the collective struggle over our shared rea
 lity: “Instead of knights in shining armor and dragons\, it’s a peasan
 t revolt\,” Kennedy explains\, “I’m all for protest songs\, but with
  this band I’ve found that sometimes your message can reach a greater au
 dience if you imbue it with a certain interactive\, almost magical realist
  element.”\nThe title track invokes images of feudal peasants\, tithes\
 , and money-hungry lords\, sounding the horn of labor with the rallying cr
 y\, “Isn’t this our harvest? Isn’t this our feast to share?” Tales
  of the undead rising to take revenge upon those who have unknowingly wron
 ged them spin out like pleasantly cathartic folktales (“Resurrection II
 ”)\, while other tracks address the profound beauty and spirit of those 
 making ends meet in the forsaken ends of POISON RUIN’s hometown of Phila
 delphia (“Blighted Quarter”). The band stares into the abyss of modern
  living with a sober and empathetic outlook\, portraying our cracked reali
 ty as a complex and difficult to parse miasma of competing desires.\nWith 
 Harvest\, POISON RUIN have constructed a richly chilling fable out of mode
 rn living. Their tale is as lurid as it is seductive\, as much a promising
  fantasy as it is a dreary portrait of reality itself. \n \n \n \nPUFFER

 ce here. We are a group of five boys from Miami\, Florida just looking for
  a good time. Now if you’d like to take the time\, we’d like to tell y
 ou how this shit-show began. On a warm summer evening in the year of our L
 ord 2015\, a young college drop out is in his backyard\, guitar in hands s
 cribbling lazily on a loose sheet of paper. He taps his pen on his chin in
 tensely\, contemplating the first and only line that reads: “I’m going
  down”. he stares down at his pathetic excuse for an opening line and ca
 lls it a night. “eh\, I’ll try again tomorrow” he says. This is his 
 mantra. He didn’t know it then\, but that pathetic little line would be 
 the birthplace of a little band called Mustard Service and that pathetic l
 ittle line would be the opening line of a little album called Zest Pop. 
 For the next two years Marco Rivero and Armando Baeza (producer and forme
 r drummer) wrote and recorded the debut album “Zest Pop”\, bringing in
  their friends Gabriel Marinuchi (guitar)\, Augusti Di Catarina (bass\, ba
 cking vocals)\, and Leo Cattani (keys) to play the songs live as a full ba
 nd. they played a few push-moshing\, beer-spilling\, gear-breaking\, cop-c
 alling\, arrested-getting shows throughout Miami-Dade County\, managing to
  amass a small yet passionate fanbase in their home town. In those years\
 , GarageBand™  transitioned into ProTools™\, recordings evolved into
  mastered tracks\, and  small house shows turned into packed venues. Th
 eir Debut album was released in June of 2017\, relying solely on live sho
 ws and streaming platform algorithms for promotion and exposure. The algo
 rithm gods took pity on these poor fools and granted them a world-wide aud
 ience over the span of the next three years\, leading into the release of 
 their sophomore album titled “Ces’t La Vie” in March of 2020.`\nRYA

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nFAKE NAMES\n \nIf credibility wer
 e currency\, Fake Names’ wealth would be off the charts. Composed ofBria
 n Baker (Minor Threat\, Bad Religion\, Dag Nasty)\, Michael Hampton (S.O.A
 .\,Embrace)\, Dennis Lyxzén (Refused\, INVSN\, The [International] Noise 
 Conspiracy)\,Johnny Temple (Girls Against Boys\, Soulside) and the newest 
 member Brendan Canty(Fugazi\, Rites of Spring)\, the band is a veritable p
 ost-hardcore dream team. Howeverinstead of rehashing the past\,Expendables
 is a reinvention that sees the band dialingback the distortion and leaning
  into the melodies. The result pairs their unparalleledpedigree with a pop
  sensibility that’s slightly unexpected and wholly satisfying. “On our
 last record [2019’sFake Names] the general influences were 70’s U.K. p
 unk and power-pop\; butit wound up with a little classic rock vibe as well
 \, like the Vibrators meetsAerosmith. We never saw that coming!” Baker e
 xplains. “The pop influences are a littlemore out front on this one and 
 the production really helps it shine. It sounds more direct\,more urgent.
 ”While the band’s debut album was actually a demo that Epitaph founder
  and Baker’s BadReligion bandmate Brett Gurewitz wanted to release as is
 \, forExpendablesthe bandenlisted producer Adam “Atom” Greenspan (IDLE
 S\, Yeah Yeah Yeahs). “On the newrecord the guitar tones are pretty clea
 n\, which is not what we normally do\, but we’re oldenough to know to gi
 ve Atom’s ideas a shot because that’s the whole point of bringingsomeo
 ne in\,” Baker explains. “Atom had me play through amps and pedals way
  out ofmy comfort zone\, but the sounds he built were perfect for the song
 s.” That sense ofcuriosity is a major thematic component ofExpendables\,
 from the chiming harmonies of“Go” to the moody melodicism of “Madtow
 n” (the latter of which could have just as easilybeen written in 1982 as
  it could in 2022). There’s also an economy to these songs that’sroote
 d in the fact that they were recorded in the span of a week\, which elimin
 ated theoption to add superfluous instrumentation or arrangements. The res
 ult is an album thatretains the members’ purity of vision in a strikingl
 y refreshing way.\n

 7PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nBLACK BELT EAGLE SCOUT\n \nThe L
 and\,The Water\, The Sky\n \nThis land runs through Katherine Paul’s blo
 od. And it called to her. In dreams she saw the river\,  her ancestors\, 
 and her home. When the land calls\, you listen. And KP found herself far f
 rom her ancestral lands during a time of collective trauma\, when the worl
 d was wounded and in need of healing. In 2020 she made the journey from Po
 rtland back to the Skagit River\, back to the cedar trees that stand tall 
 and shrouded in fog\, back to the tide flats and the mountains\, back to S
 winomish.\n \nIt is a powerful thing to return to our ancestral lands and 
 often times the journey is not easy. Like the salmon through the currents\
 , like the tide as it crawls to shore this is a story of return. It is the
  call and response. It is the outstretched arms of the people who came bef
 ore\, welcoming her home. The Land\, The Water\, The Sky is a celebration 
 of lineage and strength. Even in its deepest moments of loneliness and gri
 ef\, of frustration over a world wrought with colonial violence and pain\,
  the songs remind us that if we slow down\, if we listen to the waves and 
 the wind through the trees\, we will remember to breathe.\n \nThere is a t
 hroughline of story in every song\, a remembrance of knowledge and teachin
 gs\, a gratitude of wisdom passed down and carried. There is a reimagining
  of Sedna who was offered to the sea\, and a beautiful rumination on sacri
 fice and humanity\, and what it means to hold the stories that work to tea
 ch us something.\n \nChord progressions born out of moments of sadness and
  solitude transform into the islands that sit blue along the horizon. The 
 Salish Sea curves along her homelands\, and when the singer is close to th
 is water she is reminded of her grandmother\, how she looked out at these 
 same islands\, and she’s held by spirit and memory.\n \nThe Land\, The W
 ater\, The Sky rises and falls\, in darkness and in light\, but even in it
 s most melancholy moments it is never despairing. That is the beauty of re
 turning home. When you stand on ancestral lands it is impossible to be alo
 ne. You feel the arms and hands that hold you up\, unwilling to let you fa
 ll into sorrow or abandonment. In her songs Katherine Paul has channeled t
 hat feeling of being held. In every note she has written a love letter to 
 indigenous strength and healing.\n \nThere is a joy present here\, a fierc
 e blissfulness that comes with walking the trails along the river\, feelin
 g the sand and the stones beneath her feet. It is the pride and the certai
 nty that comes with knowing her ancestors walked along the same land\, dip
 ped their hands into the water\, and ran their fingertips along the same b
 ark of cedar trees.\n \nThis is a story of hope\, as it details the joy of
  returning. Katherine Paul’s journey home wasn’t made alone\, and the 
 songs are crowded with loved ones and relatives\, like a really good party
 . And as the songs walk us through the land it is important we hover over 
 the images and the beauty\, the moments that mark this album as site speci
 fic. The power of this land is woven throughout\, telling the story of nar
 row waterways\, brush strokes\, salmon stinta\, and above all healing.\nCL

 at the wild raucous flutes found on early Incredible String Band occupied\
 , or better still\, the right (certainly not the left) stereo channel on t

  to capture it. The group is driven by Langan and Frost’s finger-plucked
  melodies on guitar but branches out to instruments of the Middle and Far 
 East\, India\, the Mediterranean\, and Appalachia. It is the belief of the

 ond full-length under Leslie Bear’s moniker\, Long Beard\, and her first
  since 2015’s Sleepwalker. Throughout the record\, Leslie explores what
  constitutes a home — how it extends beyond the physicality of a roof ov
 er your head to the comfort of another person. A sense of self\, stability
  or security.The last four years between records mark a particularly signi
 ficant and transitional time for Bear. A career move led her back to her h
 ometown in New Jersey long after her friends and peers moved away\, result
 ing in feelings of stasis and nostalgia that shape the album. Reflections 
 on the past are evident in tracks like album single “Sweetheart”\, in 
 which Bear considers a past love\, where they are now\, and her life in re
 lation to theirs.Bear’s sophomore album shows a growth and maturation in
  sound from her debut. Co-produced with Craig Hendrix (Japanese Breakfast)
 \, the record occupies a dreamlike space that weaves between shoegaze-ting
 ed guitars and upbeat\, jangly pop. While still loyal to Leslie’s signat
 ure ethereal\, melodic guitars and haunting whispered vocal delivery\, the
  fully realized arrangements demonstrate a stunning clarity throughout the
  album.\n \nThe perfect amalgamation between Bear’s ambient-textured loo
 ps met with the pristine production and pop stylings of Hendrix’s playin
 g can be heard in album standout “Snow Globe.” The combined reversal e
 ffects\, seamless transitions\, and heartbeat percussion are the language 
 of Means To Me.What Bear has created with Means To Me is not only a mirr
 or for herself\, but also a means for the listener to reflect on what home
  means to them. Whether Bear has defined a home for herself is left to won
 der\, as she leaves us with these final lines before the album crescendos 
 into an explosive distorted instrumental and slowly fades: “driving down
  through our state lines while you dream\, I’m thinking of a name to go 
 by.”\nYOWLERYowler is the Philadelphia-based solo project of Maryn Jones
 \, who has been recording and releasing music online and in burned cd\, ta
 pe and record form since as early as 2004. What started out in 2013 as a c
 onceptual project where dark thoughts and too-quiet moments could be place
 d\, Yowler has become a main outlet for Jones’ songwriting. After most r
 ecently being a part of the loud pop outfit All Dogs as songwriter\, and l
 ong-time member and multi-instrumentalist in the psych-folk group Saintsen
 eca\, Jones has been focusing her musical time and energy on writing for Y
 owler\, and collaborating with Philadelphia-based producer and engineer Ky
 le Gilbride to create the forthcoming Black Dog in My Path. Black Dog in 
 My Path is Yowler’s second album after 2014’s release The Offer\, and 
 was recorded in the many months after Jones’ move from Columbus\, Ohio t
 o Philadelphia. Created with Gilbride of Swearin’ and Missing Earth\, th
 e record is a kind of sonic quilt\, pieced together from various musical i
 nspirations and drawn from a period of great personal change. \n

 sembled from recordings done at home and at the Bunk with a revolving door
  of friends — anchored by the core trio of Mimi Gallagher\, Cat Park\, a

  to 9 – not 10 – songs to form a concise and perfect statement. That s

 8PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nFUCKED UP\n \nI was sent an unfi
 nished version of Dose Your Dreams so that I might contribute string par
 ts. I couldn’t stop listening to the rough mixes I received. A friend as
 ked me how the record was. I replied\, “My God\, Fucked Up have made the
 ir Screamadelica.”\n \nAnd psych-rock-groove it is. The drums mixed wid
 e\, propensity for drones\, for delay pedal\, for repetition\, groove. The
  politics and aesthetics of hardcore married to an “open format” appro
 ach to genre. Elements of doo-wop\, krautrock\, groove\, digital hardcore.
 \n \n“None of Your Business Man” opens the album in familiar enough te
 rritory\, a sax-assisted exit from an office space. But things get psyched
 elic very quickly. By the time the title track arrives\, Mike Haliechuk is
  whispering\, wah pedals are in full effect\, and we’re wearing oversize
 d t-shirts and pinwheeling. “Accelerate\,” the lyrical centerpiece of 
 the album\, storms in like Boredoms on a bullet train and dissolves into a
  digital nightmare. The album closer\, “Joy Stops Time\,” finds Fucked
  Up at their most Düsseldorfian\, nearly eight minutes of blissful motori
 k.\n \nAt the center of it all is Damian Abraham’s scream—a man chaine
 d\, a man tortured\, a true protagonist. The effect is one of an epic\, ev
 ery chapter attempting its own narrative devices\, its own genre hybridiza
 tion—and it works\, it works so insanely well. The drama unfolds like a 
 miniature world of many parts being explored\, a map being illuminated\, l
 ocation by location.\n \nAs with David Comes to Life\, there is a story h
 ere. David—who once came to life—is now indentured to a desk job. Davi
 d meets the elderly Joyce who closes his eyes\, opens his mind\, and sends
  him on a spiritual journey. David embarks on his own metaphysical odyssey
 . He sees a stage adaptation of his own life. He speaks to an angel in a l
 ightbulb. He sees an infinite series of universes as simulations within si
 mulations.\n \nMeanwhile\, Lloyd—Joyce’s lover—was sent\, decades ag
 o\, by Joyce on the same odyssey\, but was lost in the void. Lloyd seeks t
 o be found and reunited with his lover. Where will David end up? Will Joyc
 e and Lloyd be reunited?\n \nDose Your Dreams—meaning: treat your dreams
  as you would a dream\, allow yourself to be lost within them\, allow them
  to open your heart and your mind\, enjoy them as you would a drug. Reach 
 out for my hand and pull me close.\n \n—Owen Pallett\n \nJune 2018\n

 nFever Museum is the first LP from the Cleveland and Philadelphia band Orb
 its. Recorded remotely over the course of 18 months while navigating the t
 edium and anxiety of the global pandemic\, Fever Museum is a concise yet s
 onically vast listen. Listeners of members Toby Reif (the Sidekicks) and M
 axwell Stern’s (Signals Midwest\, Timeshares\, Meridian) past output wil
 l find themselves in familiar territory\, yet Fever Museum’s densely lay
 ered vocals\, downtuned guitars\, synthesizers\, and odd timings position 
 the record as a unique vessel for exploring ideas well outside the realm o
 f their past output. Drummers Adam Beck (Into It. Over It.\, Sincere Engin
 eer) and Eric Slick (Dr. Dog\, Waxahatchee) also lend their talents to the
  recordings\, sharing space with Reif’s programming. Bassist Chris Bagli
 vo (Superweaks) and drummer Jarret Nathan (Pears) round out Orbits’ live
  lineup. \n \nThe remote aspect of writing and recording for Orbits was a
  natural fit for Reif and Stern. The two first met on a music forum in 200
 6\, sharing tracks from their high school bands via mediafire links and sn
 ail-mailing burned CDs. Their music careers began in parallel\, with Reif 
 booking shows from his dorm room in Bellingham\, Washington\, and Stern to
 uring from his native Cleveland. After meeting in-person for the first tim
 e in 2011\, the two began traveling the world with their respective projec
 ts\, often crossing paths and occasionally pinch-hitting in each other’s
  bands. It wasn’t until 2020\, with Stern living in Philadelphia and Rei
 f coincidentally finding himself in Cleveland\, that the two began writing
  together. They released their first music as Orbits\, the Rising Tide in 
 the Spirit Room EP\, on New Year’s Day 2021.\n

 disciplinary artist working in sound\, text\, image\, and performance. Her
  work positions itself around the spectacle of the human condition\, deepl
 y interested in questions of meaning-making\, womanhood\, socio-ecological
  systems\, and the wielding of power. Her personal philosophies around mus
 ic-making approach the sonic landscape as an object with shape\, dimension
  and weight. She has presented over 250 live performances across the US\, 
 UK\, and Europe.\nLeschper’s The Opening\, Or Closing Of A Door\, due Ma
 rch 4 via ANTI/Epitaph\, is a paean to the sensory world. It’s the first
  Leschper has released under her given name\, having retired the moniker M
 others after eight years of performing and releasing music under it. Thoug
 h both projects are guided by Leschper’s idiosyncratic approach to songw
 riting\, they couldn’t sound more different. While Mothers drew inspirat
 ion from the stark\, skeletal sounds of post-punk and contemporary folk\, 
 Leschper’s new work is practically baroque\, integrating an array of syn
 thesizers\, strings\, woodwinds\, and over a dozen percussive instruments.
 \nNINA RYSER\n \nNina Ryser was born and raised in Brooklyn\, NY\, and has
  been based in Philadelphia\, PA since 2015. Her interest in songwriting a
 nd DIY home recording started when she was 7 years old with piano lessons 
 and a Fisher Price tape recorder\, and led to her path in contemporary cla
 ssical composition for a variety of instruments and ensembles\, including 
 the American Symphony Orchestra\, which performed her 10-minute piece writ
 ten for chamber orchestra at Bard College’s Fisher Center in 2015.    
 Nina received her BA in Music Composition at Bard College where she studie
 d contemporary-classical composition and electronic music. She also hung o
 ut a lot in the film building\, where she discovered her love for green sc
 reen animation.  Nina has played in many bands\, including Palberta – a
 n art-punk/pop trio of 10 years that has released 8 full-length records an
 d several EPs which have received reviews by the New York Times\, NPR Musi
 c\, Rollingstone\, Vice and Pitchfork\; they have toured prolifically acro

 ’s self-titled\, pop-leaning solo project consists of lush synth composi
 tions accompanied by vocals and electronics. She has toured with her solo 
 project throughout the US\, and has opened for The Space Lady and Kikagaku
  Moyo. Her latest album\, Paths of Color\, is her sixth solo album: “In
  line with her past few releases\, Paths of Color is characteristic Nina
  Ryser: dreamy\, wonky\, synth-based art-pop that’s bubbly\, edgy\, swee
 t\, and dark all at once\; with elements of post-punk\, art rock\, and fre
 e jazz. But on Paths\, Ryser has honed her home recording and mixing skil
 ls and refined her home studio set-up\, making it her most polished-soundi
 ng work yet. But she’s maintained that homemade vibe\, as well as the fr
 eedom of childhood expression that is so crucial to her sound. Her backgro

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nTANUKICHAN\n \nTanukichan is the 
 solo project of classically-trained Bay Area native Hannah van Loon\, whos
 e music screeched to a halt when she discovered what she affectionately ca
 lls “dad rock” in her tween years. Throughout her self described “sh
 eltered” adolescence\, van Loon taught herself guitar by spending hours 
 in front of the radio\, replicating riffs and chords from omnipresent band
 s like The Beatles and Incubus. Although van Loon is the creator and leade
 r of Tanukichan\, the project can be considered a collaboration between he
 r and the Grammy-nominated chillwave pioneer Chaz Bear of Toro y Moi. Afte
 r seeing an early Tanukichan show in 2016\, Bear expressed an interest in 
 working with van Loon\; Radio love\,Tanukichan’s first headbanger of an 
 EP\, arrived on Bear’s own Company Records that same year.The promising 
 four-song project was followed in 2018 by van Loon’s breakout debut LP\,
  Sundays\, which prompted her first solo headlining tour and dates opening
  for artists like Kero Kero Bonito and The Drums. Sundays earned Tanukicha
 n enthusiastic critical acclaim\, with Pitchfork writing that it “captur
 es the spirit of a day whose wide-open nature fosters anxieties as well as
  ambitions” and Rolling Stone lauding its “bruising riffs\, taut groov
 es\, and open-road-ready guitar anthems.” Tanukichan’s sophomore album
  GIZMO is out on March 3rd\, 2023. While still rooted in the eerie shoegaz
 e she’s become known and loved for\, it also sees her go beyond her comf
 ort zone\, incorporating elements of grunge\, industrial synths\, nu metal
  basslines\, and electric guitars that culminate into a captivating wall-o
 f-sound. The result is her most fun-sounding work yet.\nWINTERWhat Kind of
  Blue Are You?\, Winter’s sophomore release with Bar/None Records\, is a
 n emotional excavation of Samira Winter’s purest self.\nMusically\, the 
 LP’s 10 songs reconnect with the earliest incarnation of Winter\, once a
 gain painting with brushstrokes of distorted guitar\, but using them to fu
 el a wiser\, more mature form of sonic liberation. Whereas 2020’s Endle
 ss Space (Between You and I) was steeped in fairytale surrealism and spri
 nglike grace\, her latest offering is crystalline and spartan\, songs stri
 pped to their inner blue core\, Winter’s smoldering shadow self.\nIt’s
  another stunning work in a canon that’s established her as one of Los A
 ngeles’ most enduring\, consistently-head-turning dream poppers\, the me
 lancholy and bittersweet beauty that’s been with her throughout Winter
 ’s existence now pushed to center stage. Strengthened by her ever-increa
 sing powers as a songwriter\, she confronts painful wounds of trauma and d
 espair for the first time on record\, and achieves some semblance of peace
  and healing in the process.\n

 sion between optimism and despair that’s defined much of the past few ye
 ars of American life\, examining the power (or naïveté\, depending on yo
 ur perspective) of positive thinking in the face of chaos and uncertainty.
  The songs here are tender and timeless\, with straightforward arrangement

  a soulful\, ’70s-inspired palette of playful Wurlitzer\, breezy guitars
 \, and muscular percussion.\n \nThe Cactus Blossoms broke out nationally i

 ith Kacey Musgraves\, Jenny Lewis\, and Lucius followed\, as did raves fro

  when David Lynch tapped them to perform in the return of Twin Peaks\, and
  continued to build on their success with their 2019 sophomore LP\, Easy W
 ay\, which led Rolling Stone to laud the duo’s “rock-solid\, freak of 
 genetics harmonies.”\nTWO RUNNERTwo Runner is Paige Anderson and Emilie

  influential fixture of independent music ever since. The group released t
 heir debut LP In Heaven (2011) via Domino\, and in 2012 their song Meet th
 e Frownies was sampled by Kendrick Lamar and Dr Dre on The Recipe. Having 
 left Domino and changed their name to Mr Twin Sister\, the group re-emerge
 d in 2014 with the low lit disco and funk of their self-titled Mr Twin Sis
 ter. The record appeared on best-of-year lists from Pitchfork\, Gorilla vs
  Bear\, TIME\, and many others.  In 2018 the group released Echo Arms\, t
 heir most popular track to date\, and Salt\, their third and most diverse 
 album yet. 2021 saw the release of the group’s fourth full length LP Al 
 Mundo Azul\, a vibrant\, surreal record that swaps the group’s restraine

 7PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nCOME\n \nCome is a cult American
  alternative rock band\, formed in Boston by Thalia Zedek (vocals\, guitar
 )\, Chris Brokaw (guitar\, vocals)\, Arthur Johnson (drums)\, and Sean O
 ’Brien (bass).Brokaw and Zedek had been introduced by a mutual friend in
  Boston shortly before Zedek moved to New York to join legendary noise roc
 kers Live Skull in ’86. They stayed in touch\, and Brokaw briefly played
  in Zedek’s side project Via before forming the influential slowcore gro
 up Codeine.\n \nZedek and Johnson first met in the fall of 1988 while on t
 our with their respective bands Live Skull and Bar-B-Q Killers. O’Brien 
 and Johnson were long-time friends and former housemates from the close-kn
 it Athens\, GA\, music scene of the ’80s\, where Sean played guitar and 
 then bass in the Kilkenny Cats\, and each of their bands was featured in t
 he 1987 documentary Athens\, GA–Inside/Out.\n \n1990 found all four musi
 cians living in Boston\, and they decided to join forces to see what might
  happen. The musical chemistry was immediate\, and it wasn’t long before
  the band had its first show and a recording offer from Sub Pop.\n \nCome
 ’s first release was “Car” b/w “Last Mistake\,” the August 1991 
 installment in the first volume of Sub Pop’s Singles Club. The single ma
 de them one of the most highly touted new acts on the underground scene\, 
 and there was more than one label eager to release the band’s first full
 -length effort. Come chose Matador in the US and Placebo in the UK to put 
 out their debut album Eleven Eleven in 1992. The album was a great success
  with both critics and fellow musicians\, and tours followed with Nirvana\
 , Dinosaur Jr.\, Sugar\, and Pavement\, among others. Pitchfork has called
  it “one of the most elusive gems of the Matador catalog”. After the r
 elease\, Brokaw left Codeine\, devoting himself full-time to Come.\n \nCom
 e released their second album\, Don’t Ask Don’t Tell\, in 1994\, again
  on Matador and Placebo. It was to be the last album recorded with the rhy
 thm section of Johnson and O’Brien. Though somewhat calmer than its pred
 ecessor\, it was equally as grave. Among the highlights of the album\, and
  of the whole of the band’s impressive song catalogue\, are the two dark
  ballads\, “Let’s Get Lost” and “Arrive\,” each closing a side o
 f the vinyl edition. Brokaw and Zedek’s emotional dual guitar work rival
 s Verlaine/Lloyd\, chiming and majestic\, cascading into feedback-ridden s
 qualls informed by both punk and metal\, sifted through one of the tightes
 t rhythm sections ever assembled.\n \nCome’s third record\, 1996’s Nea
 r Life Experience\, was recorded with two different rhythm sections: Tara 
 Jane O’Neil and Kevin Coultas from the now-legendary Louisville band Rod
 an\, and Chicago’s Mac McNeilly (The Jesus Lizard) and Bundy Brown (Tort
 oise). It was released on Matador in the United States and on Domino in Eu
 rope.The band’s final release\, 1998’s double album Gently\, Down the 
 Stream\, was again released on Matador/Domino and featured a new rhythm se
 ction of Daniel Coughlin on drums and Winston Braman on bass. After extens
 ive touring on the release in both Europe and the States\, the band went o
 n hiatus\, and both Brokaw and Zedek pursued solo careers and other musica
 l collaborations.\n \n \n \nSUN ORGAN\n \nPhiladelphia\, PA\n

 iani that has sparked an international cult following. His often romantic 
 brand of darkwave\, and songs like “The Perfect Girl\,” have signaled 
 a cultural paradigm shift across the online world that has united people a
 cross diverse subcultures. In describing Mareux’s sound\, reviewer Fabri
 zio Lusso puts it best\, “Mareux‘s moody and strongly emotional electr
 onic laden lo-fi approach straddles the line between synth-pop\, coldwave 
 and post-punk in a stunning and infectious blend of thick glacial beats\, 
 lustrous synth stabs\, sparse droning elements\, vigorous bleak bass pulsa
 tions and a superb passionate voice\, flavored by a mournful shadowy-goth 
 feel\, a seductive 80s flair\, and sometimes subtle groovy r&b inflection.

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\nMO TROPERMo Troper is truly one of a kind\,
  and that’s never been more apparent than on his fifth full-length\, the
  winkingly titled MTV. Arriving hot on the heels of his 2021 full-length\,
  Dilettante\, the album finds the Portland\, OR-based power pop extraordin
 aire diving further into home-recorded immediacy to make a record that fee
 ls like a strikingly direct conduit to the world of Mo–where heartbreak\
 , hilarity\, and hooks allgo hand-in-hand. “My third record\, Natural Be
 auty\, was super labored over\,” Troper explains. “It was the total op
 posite of where I am now. It cost a lot of money and took a lot of time\, 
 and it just wasn’t really rewarding by the time it was done. So I’ve b
 een less interested in doing that process again.” Most of MTV was writte
 n during\, or in the immediate aftermath of\, a lengthy tour and then quic
 kly captured at home on an 8-tracktape recorder. “I’m just really inte
 rested in writing songs–that’s the most fun part for me\,” he says. 
 “So when it comes to recording\, I think the first pass is usually best.
  The more attempts I make\, the more sterile things become. I’m just kin
 d of pushing that mentality even further now”\n2ND GRADE\n \nRinging fro
 m hi-fi headphones and blown-out boombox speakers alike comes the overload
 ed guitar genius of Easy Listening\, a record of rock ‘n’ roll daydrea
 ms and terminal boredom\, and 2nd Grade’s long awaited second LP on Doub
 le Double Whammy. Like a blue slushy on a hot day\, Easy Listening is a 
 sweet respite. Like the Blue Angels touching down on the Las Vegas Strip\,
  Easy Listening is impossible to ignore. And like a janitor mopping up b
 eer on the floor of the Hollywood Palladium in 1972\, hours after the Roll
 ing Stones have finished “Ventilator Blues” and climbed onto the bus\,
  Easy Listening knows the glory and cost of escapism\, abandon\, and the 
 soul of rock ‘n’ roll. Philadelphia’s 2nd Grade is a band both obses
 sed with and worthy of rock stardom\, and Easy Listening proves their sta
 tus as virtuosos of the power pop renaissance.\n \n \n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nWESTERMAN\n \nUK artist Westerman
  returns with his first offering in two years with the song “Idol\; RE-r
 un” out via Partisan Records. The new track\,produced by James Krivcheni
 a and Westerman\,juxtaposes gentle and celestial sonics with an aggrieved 
 disposition and features artwork by renownedNew York via Portugal Graphic 
 Designer and Illustrator Bráulio Amado. The song was written after Wester
 man emergedfrom a period of disenchantment with making music\, and with th
 e future of his career feeling abstract\, it seemed unclear to Westerman w
 hether the material he was recording would ever be heard. Creatively\, thi
 s offered a strange kind of freedom\, and accommodated some of the most ad
 venturous and unselfconscious songwriting of his career. Finding textures 
 became a central concern taking programming and looping into his own hands
  in a way he never had before\, creating polyrhythmic grooves to lend urge
 ncy to his inner dialogue.”Idol\; RE-run” is the first taste of songs 
 written in this period and provides a hint for what’s to come from Weste
 rman in the coming year. The track featuresJames Krivchenia\, Mikel Patric
 k Avery and Booker Stardrum on drums\, Ben Reed on bass\, Luke Temple on s
 ynth\, Mat Davidson on piano\, Robin Eubanks on the trombone and of course
  Westerman on vocals\, guitar and synth.Speaking about the new song\, West
 erman shares:”The lyrics to the song were written around the same time a
 s the storming of the Capitol. The compulsion towards the pedestal is stro
 ng. The need to scapegoat and revere without logic. Our populists actively
  celebrate their being people who don’t know anything other or better th
 an anyone else\, yet these spectres with their failings conduct our anger 
 and resentment as if they were gods. They are nothing more than the shadow
  of something else\, the face fronting a need to be loved or revered prese
 nt in everyone. And there will always be another face to front.”\nTWAIN\
 n \nHave you ever…\n \n…faced an impossible question\, to be answered 
 at once by a kaleidoscope of wind\, diffusing your bewilderment into thous
 ands of spinning bulbs?\n \n…awoken to hear the person sleeping beside y
 ou speaking a language they do not speak in their waking life? …felt y
 our legs possessed\, to throw you across the room in shapes? …lost you
 r heart\, only to find it on the bank of a cold spring\, in the hands of a
  filling station attendant\, or in the dust swimming through the light of 
 your bedroom window?\n \n Have you ever listened to Twain?\n \n“A lone
 ly day\, I went outside to smoke awhile\,and think about a picture in a bo
 ok:He was laying in the grass in his suit\,as the angler posed in pursuit 
 of the fish”\n \n For the past decade or so\, Mt. Davidson has cultiva
 ted his songs and sounds\, attempting to create a bridge\, a meeting place
 \, between the terrestrial and the mystic.  He is a ponderous and delicat
 e sort of creature\, short and vaguely leonine\, who has spent most of his
  young life abiding in the midlands of transcendence.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nNARROW HEAD\n \nTruly great pop s
 ongs do not require a cheery outlook in order to work\, nor do they pander
  to expectations of syrupy sweet easy-listening. Rather\, the best pop mus
 ic is a matter of refinement and pure intention\, of dialing groove to mel
 ody so that the two might puncture the malaise of everyday living in uniso
 n\, revealing some brief\, sober truth about our shared human condition. O
 n their third LP\, Moments of Clarity (Run for Cover)\, Narrow Head have a
 chieved precisely this feat. Traversing the depths of massive\, churning r
 iffs\, often distorted to the point of violence\, bouncing\, lock-grooved 
 rhythms\, and crystalline\, gorgeously constructed hooks\, the Houston-bas
 ed outfit puts on a masterclass in the art of writing songs that match the
  pain\, pleasure\, and confusion of modern living. Each track is sentiment
 al without being precious\, heavy without unnecessary griminess\, pop-forw
 ard without letting the listener off the hook easy: these songs ask for so
 me form of hurt or desire to be paid back to them in return\, some promise
  that the listener is putting equal skin into the game.\n \n \n \nGRAHAM 
 HUNT\n \nWisconsin Musician Graham Hunt’s latest effort\, “If You Knew
  Would You Believe It?” (Smoking Room Records) is a journey that confide
 ntly tackles pop/rock from every possible sonic angle.  Hunt’s penchant
  for combining wistful melodies with lyrics that make stagnant moments fee
 l improbably vivid compliments an increasingly refined incorporation of 
 ’90s and early ’00s alt-rock touchstones. Through all of the familiari
 ty\, Hunt has managed to develop a style that feels authentically singular
 \, an honest extension of his tastes\, preferences\, and experiences.\n \n

  world wasn’t built with most people in mind. For those who exist on the
  fringe\, you learn to pave your own way\, foster your own community\, and
  create your own joy. As a queer person and a daughter of migrants\, Lahey
  learned how to adapt to a world that wasn’t made for her\, and her thir

  discomfort\, whether it’s reveling in absurdity or turning towards expl

 ’s music is based on evoking mood\; their vivid arrangements utilize tim
 e and space to build soundscapes that invite the listener into their world
 . The quintet’s distinct sound pulls from 70s film scores\, the funkier 
 side of jazz\, and the samples that form the foundation of hip hop. They p
 ush the boundaries of instrumental soul and funk with their own approach h
 oned by countless hours in the studio\, studying the masters\, and perhaps
  most importantly\, the ‘tyranny of distance’ that dictates a unique p
 erspective to their music. Hailing from just outside of Melbourne\, Austra
 lia\, their first two albums\, All News Is Good News and Daylight Savings 
 amassed a die-hard fanbase and brought their sound from their home studio 
 to every corner of the globe. The band is now signed to Big Crown Records\
 , joining a lineage of contemporary and classic sounds that have influence
 d Surprise Chef’s music since their formation in2017. Surprise Chef is L
 achlan Stuckey on guitar\, Jethro Curtin on keys\, Carl Lindeberg on bass\
 , AndrewCongues on drums\, and Hudson Whitlock—the latest member who doe
 s it all from percussion to composing to producing. Their self proclaimed 
 “moody shades of instrumental jazz-funk” have a bit of everything: pun
 chy drums\, infectious keys\, rhythm guitar you might hear on a Studio One

 ors\n \n9PM – Show\nPROTOMARTYR\n \nThere is darkness in the poetry of U
 ltimate Success Today\, Protomartyr’s fifth album. The theme of things e
 nding\, above all human existence\, is present and reminiscent of Cormac M
 cCarthy’s ‘The Road’. ‘Day Without End’\, the first song\, sets 
 the tone for the whole album. “This is the dawning of the day without en
 d / when fear steps into light”. The music here sounds delicate\, airy a
 nd at the same time carried by an insistent\, light\, metallic drum part b
 y Alex Leonard and a punctuating bass line by Scott Davidson. There are ex
 quisite\, subtle gifts from other instruments that always heighten the gui
 tar\, instead of fighting with it. They help to create a harmonious wall o
 f sound all of its own. This was intentional. Greg Ahee wanted to use diff
 erent textures other than pedals\, and the drone quality of some of those 
 instruments colours the guitar and the whole sound with a warm\, rich in r
 everb\, yet all-consuming landscape for Joe Casey’s voice. The album was
  recorded in a late 19th century church Dreamland Recording Studios in ups
 tate New York\, which still has its original high arched ceilings\, creati
 ng a natural and eerie reverb. Protomartyr co-produced these songs with Da
 vid Tolomei\, who thought they would capture the essence of the place. The
  quality of sound enhances the idea of disappearance\, of dissolving away 
 through the high ceiling. Sometimes it brings us back to life and “Every
 body’s hunted with a smile / being processed by the boys”. And it soun
 ds like “a riot in the streets”.\n

 7PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nBAYONNE\n \nSince his 2016 debut
  album Primitives\, Bayonne has channeled his vast imagination into an ele
 gant yet wildly experimental form of electronic pop\, equal parts meditati
 ve and mesmerizing. In the making of his latest body of work\, the Austin-
 based artist/producer/multi-instrumentalist otherwise known as Roger Selle
 rs found himself in even greater need of an outlet for his kinetic creativ
 e impulses\, thanks to an intense convergence of events in his personal li
 fe: his father’s diagnosis with and eventual death from cancer\, the end
  of a significant relationship\, and an overwhelming struggle with depress
 ion and anxiety. Deeply informed by a deliberate transformation of his mus
 ical process\, Bayonne’s third full-length Temporary Time ultimately mak
 es for his most expansive work to date—an album of both painfully raw in
 trospection and otherworldly beauty.\n

 ittle horse makes thrilling and wildly unpredictable songs that are a refl
 ection of the joys that come with making music with your best friends. The
  Pittsburgh quartet’s sophomore album\, Girl with Fish\, which is out Ju
 ne 9 via Saddle Creek\, was made focusing on intuition over intention: let
 ting the magic of collaboration come first. “Anything that makes us laug
 h or puts a smile on our faces\, we usually end up keeping in the songs\,
 ” explains drummer Jake Kelley. Across 11 self-recorded and self-produce
 d tracks\, the band careens from blissed-out pop to harsh noise\, glitchy 
 programmed drum beats\, and off-kilter indie rock—sometimes all in one s
 ong. As a follow-up to their critically acclaimed 2021 debut Hayday\, this
  LP\, with its overwhelmingly inviting and emotionally resonant tracklist\
 , is a document of four people trusting their instincts and most important
 ly each other.\n

 91. Comprised of bassist and vocalist Chris Murphy\, guitarists/vocalists 
 Jay Ferguson and Patrick Pentland\, and drummer/vocalist Andrew Scott\, th
 e quartet possessed a rare chemistry from the start. There are so many mom
 ents peppered throughout the 30-year history of Canadian indie rock heroes
  Sloan that set them well apart from the pack. From the band’s earliest 
 home studio recordings that married their pop smarts with fizzy\, fuzzed o
 ut guitars\, right up to later efforts that contain multitudes in their tr
 ack listings\, ranging from Dylanesque streams of consciousness to short\,
  sharp blasts of power pop — Somehow\, it all remains quintessentially S

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nREMEMBER SPORTS\n \nAfter four al
 bums of expertly crafted pop punk\, Remember Sports follows up last year
 ’s epic Like a Stone with the first EP of their decade-long run. Recorde
 d piece meal in their respective homes\, sometimes together\, sometimes ap
 art\, Leap Day trades the live immediacy of their studio classics for some
 thing cozier\, though no less rousing. The core trio of Carmen Perry\, Cat
 herine Dwyer\, and Jack Washburn have always kept up active home recording
  practices for their solo projects–Carmen as Addie Pray\, Catherine as S
 pring Onion\, Jack under his own name–and here we find them gently foldi
 ng sounds sprung from their bedrooms into their signature brand of basemen
 t rock. Absent a dedicated drummer for the first time in their recorded hi
 story\, the band opts for simple drum machine accompaniment\, lending the 
 music a fresh weightlessness even as Carmen’s arresting vocals and sharp
  lyrics bring gravity in all their righteous anger\, scathing self-reproac
 h\, and disarming tenderness. Musically\, all the thrilling guitar riffs a
 nd grooving bass lines we’ve come to expect are here\, but the gradual r
 ecording process offered the band more opportunity to explore and experime
 nt\, adding on subtle layers of instrumentation\, distortion\, and electro
 nics\, and with them a warm sense of depth. In all\, Leap Dayis a short an
 d sweet\, loose but confident affair\; at once a reminder of Remember Spor
 ts’ absolute mastery of the pop rock anthem and a tantalizing sip from t
 he well of ideas they have yet to plumb.\n

 ke a kid: experimenting\, having fun\, and trying to discover new things a
 bout this work\,” says Pile’s Rick Maguire about All Fiction. It’s h
 is band’s eighth record\, and one that finds the ambitious group assembl
 ing its most texturally complex material yet—despite the fraught inspira
 tion underscoring its restive lyrics. Alongside the blistering drums and s
 corched-earth riffs that first galvanized Pile’s dedicated fanbase\, the
  band has incorporated elegiac strings\, mystifying vocal corrosions\, and
  haunting synths. From the creeping fear of cinematic opener “It Comes C
 loser” to the euphorically ascending keys on ego-shattering closer “Ne
 on Gray\,” All Fiction is an ornate\, carefully paced study on the subje
 ctivity of perception\, the data-shaping despotism of big tech\, and the c
 onnections between anxiety and death. In its most vital moments\, it’s a
 lso a resolute recommitment to the restorative significance of art and ima
 gination.\n \nFor fifteen years\, Pile’s evolving take on rock has earne
 d the group one oft-repeated superlative: “your favorite band’s favori
 te band.” Ceaseless touring took its members from Boston’s basement ci
 rcuit to international festivals\, hitting loftier technical apexes with e
 ach new record. Maguire—the fastidious composer\, evocative guitarist\, 
 and potent voice behind the solo-turned-punk project—gives musical body 
 to his interior world in scream-along-able lyrics that skew surreal. \n
