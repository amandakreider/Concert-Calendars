 oors9 PM – Show\nSLOW HOLLOWSAfter a three-year hiatus\, Slow Hollows re
 turns reinvented\, sharing new single & video “Old Yeller.” The genre-
 defying Los Angeles band founded by songwriter Austin Feinstein is now his
  solo project. Though the group amicably disbanded in early 2020\, the now
  25-year-old artist never stopped writing songs. The more he fleshed out n
 ew material\, the more Feinstein realized it made sense to continue on as 
 Slow Hollows. “Ultimately making a cohesive record was the most importan
 t thing to me\,” says Feinstein. “Having some time away from the band 
 made me realize what ‘Slow Hollows’ stood for. It’s hard to realize 
 what you’re getting at when you’re doing it\, so the time to myself he
 lped me understand what made it work.” In sharp contrast to 2019’s Ac
 tors\, which interpolated R&B and dance music and was influenced by collab
 orations with Frank Ocean (Feinstein sings the chorus on Blonde’s “Sel
 f Control”) and Tyler\, the Creator (who crafted the beat for Actors’ 
 “Heart”)\, “Old Yeller” focuses purely on Feinstein’s songwritin
 g\, stripping things back to only an acoustic guitar\, his voice\, and gen
 tle atmospherics. “Old Yeller was recorded in two or three takes one aft
 ernoon in September ‘22” shares Feinstein\, “The lyrics take inspira
 tion from the job of an old vacuum cleaner\; feeling dusty and worn down\,
  working over the same familiar spaces over and over again\, until reachin
 g the point of frustration and resignation. Taking production inspiration 
 from John Cale\, we decided to add a drone underneath the track.”\nCOMPU
 TERWIFENew York City-based Addie Warncke began Computerwife in 2018 at the
  beginning of her college career\, using SoundCloud as a diary to chronicl
 e her emotions. When the pandemic hit\, Warncke released the five songs sh
 e was proudest of as her self-titled debut EP\, and the strength of those 
 tracks led to a signing with Danger Collective Records. Now\, she’s pois
 ed to release her debut self-titled full-length: a raw and intimate portra
 it of her experiences processing the small but poignant moments that shape
  a life. Computerwife’s sound is captivating and nuanced\, pushing the b
 oundaries between analog and digital. “The main theme that ties this alb
 um together is an interest in the deep web and an attempt to combine exist
 ing media to make something new\,” she explains. With her seamless blend
  of shoegaze\, emo\, and lo-fi noise pop\, Computerwife speaks directly to
  the disquiet experienced by every 21st century digital girl with a tenuou
 s grip on life and identity.\n

 – Doors8PM – Show\n \nMICHAEL HURLEY\nMichael Hurley grew up in Bucks
  County\, Pennsylvania. As a teenager in the 1950s he fell in love hearing
  the music of Fats Domino\, The Everly Brothers and Bo Diddley blast from 
 the radio\, and was enthralled by the records of Blind Willie McTell\, Han
 k Williams and Uncle Dave Macon that he sought for his own. This love for 
 music\, true and unvarnished\, supplied him with a finely tuned musical co
 mpass he has not wavered from for 50 years and counting. Hurley’s music 
 sounds old\, like it has always existed\, and simultaneously singular\, li
 ke something you’ve never heard anyone else play quite like that before.
  This timeless quality ensures that Hurley’s audience constantly renews 
 itself. From the the beatniks in the NYC Village where he started in the e
 arly 60s\, to the hippies in Vermont\, to the Americana fans\, indie rocke
 rs and freak folkers from the last two decades\, Michael’s music never f
 ails to find fresh new ears. Pressed for a description\, Hurley has called
  it “jazz-hyped blues and country and western music”.\nHurley’s earl
 y records were released on Folkways\, Warner Brothers/Raccoon\, and Rounde
 r\, while in recent years stalwart independent labels like No Quarter\, Fe
 eding Tube\, and Mississippi have been carrying the torch. The great news 
 is that there is no stopping Michael Hurley. His 2021 album\, The Time Of 
 The Foxgloves on No Quarter Records received rave reviews world wide. A ne
 w album for the same label is in the can. Besides being a truly unique mus
 ician\, Hurley is also a cartoonist and watercolor artist of note — the 
 instantly recognizable results of which grace his album covers.\nHurley no
 w resides on the west coast\, so east coast appearances have been scarce t
 he last decade. Old and new fans should not pass up the rare opportunity t
 o catch Michael in action on various New England and New York state stages
 .\nMichael Hurley makes a great cameo and performs his classic “Oh My St
 ars” in the movie Leave No Trace\n \n \nSHANNEN MOSER\nShannen Moser w
 ants to have a conversation: with their past selves\, their present self\,
  their undesignated\, unfurling future selves\; with the trees that adorn 
 their old street\, and the door they used to call home\; with the shadows 
 of lovers-turned-to-friends and the overwhelming cacophony of abrupt chang
 e. They’re drawing a map but the port of call is cloudy and indistinct. 
 It’s while traveling along these nebulous contours that their latest alb
 um The Sun Still Seems To Move forms a kind of physicality\, of outstretch
 ed giving hands\, that offers a guide through the fog. Here\, Moser examin
 es the disorientating\, challenging task of trying to hold onto ourselves
 ––and everything else––all at once. But this isn’t a fatalistic 
 journey of melancholy or apprehension. Instead\, Moser celebrates the smal
 l steps and the unwavering perseverance that makes it all worthwhile.\n

 It’s a spotlight on the honest truth of Molly’s experience before and

  birth name is Mary\, and each track feels like a different aspect of the 
 intersection between a buttoned-up Mary and a buttoned-down Molly. Nowhere

 am Evian started recording Plunge\, his fourth LP\, now set for release on
  Flying Cloud Recordings via Thirty Tigers – his first album on his new 
 imprint. He invited his friends and fellow musicians to his property in th
 e Catskills\, where he’d just painstakingly relocated and revamped his F
 lying Clouds Studios into a new barn on the property\, restoring a vintage
  console and tape deck from 1974. Adrianne Lenker brought a jug of maple s
 yrup from Vermont\, Sufjan Stevens set off fireworks in the meadow\, and a
 t midnight\, the group of friends cold-plunged into a nearby creek as it s
 tarted snowing. The next day\, the Plunge sessions began\, and the album 
 was tracked in the early winter months of 2023 over a 10-day period. Joine
 d by a group of his closest friends and collaborators (including Liam Kaza
 r\, Sean Mullins\, El Kempner of Palehound and Adrianne Lenker of Big Thie
 f)\, the young artist / producer set out with a wide-open approach. “No-
 one knew the songs or what the plan was. We kept it loose and fun. This wa
 s the spirit of the sessions. No headphones\, no playback\, minimal overdu
 bs\, or bleed. Fast and loose.”The result is Evian’s best album to dat
 e: a cathartic rock record that melds power pop\, iridescent guitar\, rauc
 ous psychedelia\, and Sam’s now sought-after grooves. The music is both 
 fresh and familiar\, sonically inspired by his penchant for early 70s prod
 uction and creatively propelled by the free-spirited process depicted in t

 oors8 PM – Show\nPACKSMadeline Link\, who makes music under the moniker 
 PACKS\, has always found inspiration in her surroundings.  When it came t
 o newest effort Melt the Honey (her second full-length in the space of a y
 ear)\, she wanted to look beyond the mundane spaces that had informed much
  of her previous work.  Over the course of 11 days last March\, Link and 
 the rest of her band (Dexter Nash [guitar]\, Noah O’Neil [bass] and Shan
 e Hooper [drums]) gathered in Mexico City\, a city that already held a spe
 cial place in her heart as an artist-in-residence at Casa Lü in 2020).  
 PACKS practiced new songs in a rented studio space\, with each member brin
 ging their aesthetic sensibility to the table. From there\, they took a bu
 s to Xalapa where they spent the remainder of their time abroad working at
  a house known as Casa pulpo\, an architectural feat removed from the bust
 le of city life\, owned and operated by Wendy Moira\, the visionary behind
  Teatro Lucido\, a prominent theater and music venue in Mexico City. “Th
 e house has no straight lines\, it puts you in a creative mindset\,” Lin
 k says. “Plus\, it was really warm\, we were there for three weeks enjoy
 ing the weather and self-recording with minimal equipment.”Melt the Hone
 y emulates the environment in which it was made\; it’s a warm\, unvarnis
 hed album\, one that invites the listener into PACKS’s familial way of w
 orking. Listening to it makes one feel as if they were there in the forest
 s of Veracruz while the band laid down tracks. “Paige Machine” opens w
 ith the hiss of rain from an epic thunderstorm as Hooper counts in the son
 g that was inspired by Mark Twain. “He invested in a printing device cal
 led the Paige Compositor\, spent his life’s savings on it\, and it worke
 d almost perfectly\, it would have been revolutionary\,” Link explains. 
 “But then the inventor\, Paige\, took it apart to tweak something\, make
  the machine work even better\, and it never worked again. They say that t
 his failure led to Mark Twain’s decline.” To Link\, the Paige Machine 
 is an apt metaphor for life\, wherein our stubborn\, progress-hungry attem
 pts to improve what is already working can lead to obsessive tinkering and
  endless re-dos. Embracing imperfection proved critical while recording at
  Casa pulpo\, where outages caused by storms and inconsistent electrical w
 iring ended up serving the record’s ethos rather than hindering it. Anot
 her stand-out track\, “HFCS\,” begins with Link singing a note far out
  of her typical register. “I dunno if that’s gonna work\,” she says\
 , laughing\, before the bold lead guitar part takes over\, launching them 
 into a straight-up power pop song reminiscent of the Hives. It’s a song 
 that’ll get the crowd moving\, as Link sings about the tantalizing\, if 
 sickening\, promise of downing a bottle of Crown high fructose corn syrup\
 , just for the thrill of it. “It’s about that creepy rush of adrenalin
 e\,” she says. “Like when you drink a lot of pop or get a text from a 
 crush.”\nDOLL SPIRIT VESSEL (Solo)\n

 Freeman deals in biblical deluges\, apocalyptic fever dreams\, Floridian m
 iscreants\, and green mountain malaise. On his excellent debut LP “I Loo

 pable urgency\, whether it is the punch-in-the-face\, careening momentum o
 f “Tower\,” the country-gazing guitar squall of “Souvenir Heart\,”
  or the singalong finale of “Palms.” Careful arrangements and producti

 of songwriting is 100% what I’m about\,” says Dent May. “That’s wh
 at keeps me going. My goal is to just live a long life and write a ton of 
 good songs.” With the Mississippi-raised\, Los Angeles-based musician an
 d pop auteur what you see is what you get: a restless and prolific artist 
 who worships at the altar of a memorable hook and a sharp lyric. There is 
 no gimmick or press-ready narrative about May overcoming past trauma\, men
 tal breakdowns\, or surpassing insurmountable obstacles. This is simply a 
 guy who is extraordinarily good at making warm and inviting tunes. He’s 
 done it for over 15 years and isn’t stopping anytime soon. The 38-year-
 old artist has made a career of impeccably crafted pop songs starting with
  his 2009 debut The Good Feeling Music of Dent May &amp\; His Magnificent 
 Ukulele\, which came out on Animal Collective’s label Paw Tracks. His fo
 llow-ups in 2012’s Do Things and 2013’s Warm Blanket solidified him as
  a bedroom pop pioneer whose songs felt equally timeless and ahead- of-the
 -curve. Following a move from Mississippi to Los Angeles\, May signed with
  Carpark and released two increasingly adventurous albums in the psychedel
 ic Across the Multiverse from 2017 and the silky Late Checkout in 2020. H
 is latest LP is What’s For Breakfast?\, his sixth album and third with C
 arpark\, marks a shift from timeless pop to more guitar-driven rock. The 1
 0-song collection is some of May’s most energetic and immediate tunes ye
 t. It mirrors his relentlessly prolific streak\, which includes platinum- 
 certified singles with Eyedress and guest appearances with The Undercover 
 Dream Lovers\, Bob Jr.\, and Paul Cherry. Alongside two other artists\, he
  operates and works out of the recording studio Honeymoon Suite in northea
 st Los Angeles.\nJIMMY WHISPERSA lot has changed for everyone over the 8 y
 ears since Jimmy Whispers released his debut LP\, especially for Jimmy him
 self. In another lifetime\, he was that sweet kid from Chicago who stole o
 ur hearts with his aw-shucks Midwestern attitude and his knack for writing
  catchy old-time melodies. Legendary critic Jessica Hopper once called him
  the city’s “greatest new homegrown musical enigma\,” and he turned 
 a mixtape of iPhone voice memos (Summer in Pain) into a profound racket\, 
 that saw him perform at the Pitchfork Music Festival and earn praise from 
 that outlet and places like Stereogum\, Spin\, BrooklynVegan\, VICE\, NME\
 , and many others. If you caught a glimpse\, it was exciting\, but it was 
 just a warm-up to his second act. As for today\, Jimmy Whispers is alive a
 nd well in Los Angeles. He’s still making music—quite a lot of it. He
 ’s got a blossoming new career as a music video director and filmmaker. 
 He’s become a co-writer for others including Drugdealer and Dent May. He
 ’s got his sobriety\, a new commitment to making life-a ffi rming art\, 
 and a 1988 Buick Reatta. Jimmy Whispers has returned with a new LP The Sea
 rch For God out June 9th on Carpark Records. His first since his 2015 debu
 t\, the album was co-produced by Ziyad Asrar of the band Whitney\, and ret

 ment when a listener truly connects to a song. It’s an intangible reacti
 on that bridges science and emotion\, turning firing synapses into somethi
 ng cosmically beautiful. Another Michael exists for that moment: when a so
 ng transforms the setting of a long walk home\, or speaks to a past experi
 ence while simultaneously making a new one\, or taps into something univer
 sal by relating details so specific and personal that they could only be r
 evealed in music. In 2023 the band released Wishes To Fulfill\, the first 
 in a pair of albums dedicated to their love of song\, and now they’re ba
 ck already with the experimental next chapter\, Pick Me Up\, Turn Me Upsid
 e Down. Together\, the dual LPs create and pay tribute to the power of tra
 nscendent musical moments. Wishes To Fulfill and Pick Me Up\, Turn Me Ups
 ide Down are contrasting but complimentary albums: musical siblings that a
 re undeniably different entities but still share key sonic DNA. They each 
 offer a plethora of dynamics\, feelings\, and moods to soundtrack the rich
 ness of life\, and form Another Michael’s finest work to date. Where Wis
 hes To Fulfill was a lean 29-minute set of single-worthy tracks\, Pick Me 
 Up\, Turn Me Upside Down is more expansive\, patiently unfolding to reveal
  an exploratory side that brings new hues into the band’s vibrant sound.
  Another Michael’s adoration for music allows for simple sonic satisfac
 tion\, but it also taps into something deeper\, something connective. “M
 usic is a medium of communication\,” says bassist Nick Sebastiano\, “I
 t’s not a purposeful decision to talk about music in our songs but it ju
 st inherently means so much to us. If something makes your heart sing\, th
 e audience is going to hear it.” On Wishes To Fulfill and Pick Me Up\, T
 urn Me Upside Down\, the band didn’t set out to capture the all encompas
 sing\, existential value of music\, but they did contribute to it–offeri
 ng more songs to the world\, and with them\, chances to create one of thos
 e moments.\nTENCIA Swollen River\, A Well Overflowing is Tenci’s second 
 album\, following their 2020 debut My Heart Is An Open Field\, which intro
 duced Jess Shoman’s musical explorations to the world. Shoman admits tha
 t their first album dealt with letting go of painful life experiences\, re
 sulting in emptiness. In this more recent collection Tenci carries an oppo
 site feeling\, a celebration of self-rejuvenation. A Swollen River\, A Wel
 l Overflowing shows Shoman steering their inventive music further and wild
 er\, spilling over 12 fable-like songs. In a combination of milk\, coins\,
  glass\, water\, and light\, each song forms a spell to “fill my heart b
 ack up\,” Shoman says\, “by reframing complex feelings by turning my h
 ead sideways and seeing them in a different way.”\n

 nuine love of connecting with people\, and passionately eclectic musical t

 to the raw freedom of Jeff Buckley\, from Missy Elliott’s electric caden

 ission slip and says ‘you are allowed to make art now.’ You either do 
 it or you don’t.”\nWhile the nine songs on Grace for the Going are dis

  Initially a studio project formed with the help of Engineer and Producer

 es from a plethora of genres\, both modern and classic\, refusing to be bo
 xed in by conventional labels. The outcome is an ever-changing musical lan
 dscape that continues to evolve along with their line-up. On their last E
 P Endless Mirage\, Savoth and King collaborated with the Synth & Soul reco

 t full-length album Axis of Time. According to Outlaw\, the record is mean
 t to transport the listener to a dream-like state\, where space and time s
 lowly fade away and reality is merely a distant memory. From the euphoric 
 highs of lead single “Free My Mind” and uninhibited groove of “Speed
  of Light” to the trance-like meditation of “Dreams” and mournful me
 lodies of “Invisible Clock\,” Angelo and the EHS house band truly go t

 oors8 PM – Show\nTWENTwen is a van-lifeing rock band that emerged onto t
 he east coast music scene in 2017 with their distinct blend of shoegaze\, 
 indie rock\, and post-punk influences. Though the band was formed in 2016 
 by lead vocalist Jane Fitzimmons and guitarist Ian Rollins Jones\, their e
 mergence post-pandemic has marked the beginning of what is essentially an 
 entirely new project\; save for their keeping the name “Twen”.This lat
 est chapter is marked by the band booking their own tours\, designing and 
 screen printing their own merch\, directing and editing their own music vi
 deos\, and producing and mixing their own albums\; all to a degree which w
 ould seem impossible to believe\, if you didn’t know that they also buil
 t their own mobile-home from scratch and have been living in it\, traversi
 ng the North American continent for the past 3 years.The duo-led 5 piece a
 re readying their 3rd LP to be released in 2024\, but have already debuted
  lead single ‘SeaStar’\; an early 00’s throwback to Southern Califor
 nia beach anthems that finds the band further evolving from the coy\, shoe
 gaze aesthetics of ‘Awestruck’ (2019) – to a modern classicism\; cha
 racterized on their 2nd LP ‘One Stop Shop’ (2022) by political (yet ho
 peful) lyrics\, indelible hooks and a home-grown sonic mix that rewards th
 e listener with each subsequent spin.With over 350 shows under their belt 
 across North America and Europe\, including arena appearances supporting R
 ainbow Kitten Surprise\, Wet Leg\, Whitney\, Tacocat\, & White Reaper\, Tw
 en’s live show exhibits their all-around relevance as a DIY rock band th
 riving in the digital age.\n

 group’s lush washes of effects-heavy guitars and yearning vocals recall 
 U.K. shoegaze acts like Kitchens of Distinction and Ride\, and American in

 s and Kisses EPs in 2003 and 2004\, then sporadically resurfaced with the 
 albums The Battle of Sealand (2007) and Molten Young Lovers (2017).  Wink
 s and Kisses was remastered for a 20th anniversary deluxe reissue in 2023.
   The 20th anniversary deluxe edition included demos dating back to the g

 de’s Mark Gardener for engineering\, mixing\, and mastering duties\, Sug
 arcoat is a dense\, reverb-laden exploration of alt rock’s 40+ year hist
 ory that conjures up concord from chaos. Whether it’s the post-punk-ting
 ed “Seafoam” (which happens to feature Jeff Schroeder on lead guitar) 
 or the hypnotic psych of “Slyce”\, Blushing weaves a cohesive musical 
 arc that effortlessly blends their disparate influences into a sonic water
 mark that is unmistakably their own.\nBODYWASHBodywash formed in 2014 as a
  vehicle for the sonic bond between Chris Steward and Rosie Long Decter. T
 he Montreal duo conjure a dreamscape with airy vocals\, intricate guitars 
 and pulsating synths over a heavy rhythmic foundation. In 2019\, they rele
 ased their debut LP\, Comforter\, which received praise from Bandcamp Dail
 y\, NPR\, Clash Mag and elsewhere.  The sophomore LP finds the band exper
 imenting with glitching drones and cascading vocals while exploring themes
  of dislocation and decay. In support of the record\, the duo has played a
  series of headlining dates across North America as well as festival spots
  at SXSW\, Treefort Fest\, Sled Island and more.\n

  inadvertently developing his own singular style. Summers in Ireland lent 
 their own inspiration\, as did 10 straight years camping at Bonnaroo. Prin
 e’s musical tastes grew to become decidedly eclectic\, spanning John May
 er\, Outkast\, Bon Iver\, the Strokes and more.It wasn’t until Prine rea
 ched his mid-twenties\, though\, that he considered a career of his own in
  music and began to share with others the songs he wrote in private. His s

 on the choices we make\, and the people we always come back to.Davis earne

  “I finally feel like this album is more me than anything else that’s

  Playing for over 25 years\, Etran has emerged as stars of the local weddi

 hborhood of Abalane\, just in the shadow of the grand mosque. Sons of noma
 dic families that settled here in the 1970s fleeing the droughts\, they al
 l grew up in Agadez. The band was formed in 1995 when current band leader 
 Moussa “Abindi” Ibra was only 9 years old. “We only had one acoustic
  guitar\,” he explains\, “and for percussion\, we hit a calabash with 
 a sandal.” Over the decades\, the band painstakingly pieced together gea
 r to form their band and built an audience by playing everywhere\, for eve
 ryone. “It was difficult. We would walk to gigs by foot\, lugging all ou
 r equipment\, carrying a small PA and guitars on our backs\, 25 kilometers
  into the bush\, to play for free…there’s nowhere in Agadez we haven
 ’t played.”From the days of the Trans-Saharan caravan in the 14th cent

 that stands at the crossroads\, where people and ideas come together. Unde
 rstandably\, it’s here where one of the most ambitious Tuareg guitar has
  taken hold. Agadez’s style is the fastest\, with frenetic electric guit
 ar solos\, staccato crash of full drum kits\, and flamboyant dancing guita
 rists. Agadez is the place where artists come to cut their teeth in a lucr
 ative and competitive winner-take-all scene. Guitar bands are an integral

  effort\, as all songs were written\, produced and engineered by frontpers
 on & multi-instrumentalist\, KC Abrams\, who explored themes of human conn

  cult favorite Japanese band\, Fishmans (active throughout the late 80’s

  (released by Native Cat Recordings in 2019)\, found Murphy taking the mic
  for the first time to deliver dreamy dance tracks that felt home-cooked a
 nd effortlessly chic. Her layered percussion and hypnotic\, expressive voc
 als coupled with Stuart’s production and harmonic palette evoked shades 
 of disco\, ‘90s house\, and a sly pop sensibility. ”A smooth\, sumptuo
 us\, and soulful record\,” said Bandcamp\, who helped propel the group
 ’s early following. Murphy’s musical talents are family heirlooms: he
 r father\, percussionist and engineer Patrick Murphy\, taught Brijean her 
 first patterns on a pair of congas that she inherited from the late Trinid
 adian steel drum legend Vince Charles (of Neil Diamond). Growing up in LA
 ’s Glassell Park\, Murphy was raised by a cadre of honorary aunts and un
 cles – a deep bench of jazz\, Latin and soul musicians in their own rite
 s. This meant she grew up regaled by musical lore – larger-than-life tal
 es of jazz luminaries\, psychedelic trips and obscure cultural enclaves 
 – sampling some of those family stories and weaving them into her work. 
 Growing up outside of Chicago\, Stuart found his way into jazz clubs and f
 estivals as a teenager\, frequently going to hear Jeff Parker\, Fred Ander
 son\, and other members of the AACM. While attending the University of Mic
 higan\, he studied under Detroit jazz royalty\, Robert Hurst and Geri Alle
 n. After college\, Stuart became intrigued by the music of J Dilla and Moo
 dymann\, and began learning production and exploring the connections betwe
 en jazz\, house\, and hip-hop.\n

 oors8 PM – Show\nTHE CLIENTELEThe Clientele’s ‘I Am Not There Anymor
 e’ follows 2017’s ‘Music for the Age of Miracles’ (which arrived a
 fter a seven-year hiatus for the band)\, with new recording sessions begin
 ning in 2019 and continuing piecemeal until 2022 —in part due to the pan
 demic and also because the band wanted the space to experiment. “We’d 
 always been interested in music other than guitar music\, like for donkey
 ’s years\,” vocalist/lyricist/guitarist Alasdair MacLean says. This ti
 me out\, he — alongside bassist James Hornsey and drummer Mark Keen — 
 incorporated elements of post-bop jazz\, contemporary classical and electr
 onic music. According to MacLean\, “None of those things had been able t
 o find their way into our sound other than in the most passing way\, in th
 e faintest imprint.”This stretching out — what MacLean calls “a leap
  forwards and to the side” — can be heard clearly in “Blue Over Blue
 \,” with its percussive samples and its moments where the arrangement op
 ens up suddenly into something cinematic in scope\, with horns and strings
 . “What happened with this record was that we bought a computer\,” Mac
 Lean explains. Under the old Clientele way of recording\, a tricky song li
 ke “Blue Over Blue” might’ve eaten up all their studio time\, as the
 y worked out the time signature and the instrumentation. For ‘I Am Not T
 here Anymore\,’ though\, the trio would lay down a few tracks and then t
 ake them home to play around\, trying out different arrangements before re
 turning to the studio to finish recording all the little instrumental enha
 ncements.“Blue Over Blue” depicts MacLean’s scary adventure of being
  lost in the woods with his son\, he explains: “‘Blue Over Blue’ is 
 about getting lost in the woods on Hampstead Heath on an autumn day with m
 y two-year-old son on my shoulders—he loved it and wanted to play hide a
 nd seek. I knew he was a ticking time bomb as I had no food with me and wa
 s trying to find my way back to a path.” The accompanying video sees the
  band adorned in armor beneath beautiful and abstract artwork.Over the 32-
 year career of the pop band The Clientele\, critics and fans have often de
 scribed their songs with words like “ethereal\,” “shimmering\,” 
 “hazy\,” “pretty” and “fragile.” MacLean\, though\, has his ow
 n interpretation of the effect his music creates. “It’s that feeling o
 f not being there\,” he says. “What’s really been in all the Cliente
 le records is a sense of not actually inhabiting the moment that your body
  is in.”\n

 ge is the only law.”With a credo adapted from science fiction author Oct
 avia E. Butler\, an album title from a collection of metaphysical poetry\,
  and an expansion in consciousness brought on by personal crisis\, guitari
 st and songwriter Shana Cleveland learns to embrace a changing world with 
 unconditional love on News of the Universe\, the new full-length from Cali
 fornia rock band La Luz.News of the Universe is a record born of calamity\
 , a work of dark\, beautiful psychedelia reflecting Cleveland’s experien
 ce of having her world blown apart by a breast cancer diagnosis just two y
 ears after the birth of her son. It’s also a portrait of a band in flux\
 , marking the first appearance for drummer Audrey Johnson and the final on
 es from longtime members bassist Lena Simon and keyboardist Alice Sandahl\
 , whose contributions add a bittersweet edge to a record that is both eleg
 y for an old world and cosmic road map to a strange new one.But is there a
 ny band in the world more suited to capturing the chaos of change in all i
 ts messy beauty than La Luz? Formed by Cleveland in 2012\, La Luz is belov
 ed for their ability to balance bedlam and bliss\, each new record another
  fine-tuning of the band’s mix of swaggering riffs with angelic vocals b
 orrowed from doo-wop and folk\; a band so reliably great that it makes the
  huge step forward in confidence and sheer musicality that is News of the 
 Universe all the more formidable. Cleveland\, also a writer and painter\, 
 has developed into a truly original songwriter with her own canon of haunt
 ed psychedelia that\, in recent years\, has drawn upon the changing landsc
 ape around her rural California home for inspiration\, notably on last yea
 r’s critically acclaimed solo release\, Manzanita\, a magical realist do
 cumentation of her pregnancy and early motherhood that appeared on many ye
 ar-end lists.Yet if Cleveland has spent years writing songs about ghosts\,
  what lurks in the shadows of News of the Universe is nothing less than de
 ath itself. “There are moments on this album that sound to me like the l
 ast frantic confession before an asteroid destroys the earth\,” says Cle
 veland.\n
