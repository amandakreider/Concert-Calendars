 oors9 PM – Show\nILLITERATE LIGHT\nIt’s dangerous to put Illiterate Li
 ght in a box\, especially with the release of their new album\, Arches. Ar
 e they a guitar-driven indie rock duo? Kaleidoscopic neo-psychedelia? Synt
 h-kissed\, harmony-laden folk? What does one do with an album beginning wi
 th “fake tits and diet coke\,” then pivoting to train derailments in r
 ural Ohio and never-ending black holes? These prolific farmers-turned-rock
 ers have captured the energy of their live shows—fans crowd-surfing\, mo
 shing\, crying\, and crooning—and infused it into their latest release.
 “We’ve always been shape shifters\, moving between heavy\, dark distor
 tion and gentle sweet fingerpicking\, writing aggressive songs\, introspec
 tive songs\, and love songs\, exploding and embracing\,” reflects singer
 -guitarist Jeff Gorman. “Smashing it all together used to feel strange\,
  but now there’s a glue between everything we do. Our fans get it. They 
 care less about genre. All they care about is feeling. And that’s all we
  care about. Are you alive or not?”Illiterate Light’s third album\, Ar
 ches\, is not a passageway but an arrival. “We’re no longer striving t
 o define a sound\,” said drummer Jake Cochran. “We’re leaning into s
 ides of ourselves that have felt off-limits\, sticking to what feels right
  rather than concerning ourselves with comparison.” Out November 1 via T
 hirty Tigers\, the record is bursting with thunderous anthems\, biting lyr
 ics\, and lush harmonies.\nPALMYRA\n

 oors9 PM – Show\nSIX ORGANS OF ADMITTANCEWith Time is Glass\, Six Organs
  of Admittance is captured once again in the intricate tangle of the fretb
 oards\, soaring in open skies above. Like lens flare cutting through the s
 peakers\; spiderwebs cracking the windshield that holds back all the onrus
 hing reality. Blowing the dust away\, cutting a new path for cognition. As
  is always endeavored…. After 20 years of living on the road in differe
 nt places\, Six Organs of Admittance had returned home to Humboldt County 
 — a far country\, to some\, but still part o f the world through which c
 reatures of all kinds are moving through and contributing to. And some of 
 them are human. Alone together — forming connection and exchange out of 
 thought and expression — no different from the people on the other side 
 of the Redw ood Curtain. It was there\, where Six Organs had long ago emer
 ged\, in the name of everything cycling\, of circles that spiral concentri
 cally and remain unbroken\, the new music was conceived. In moments\, it 
 was as if the future had some – how wrapped around 360 degrees\; elsewhe
 re\, the systems and patterns inside the writing and recording only became
  evident later — like a recognition that cumulus and nimbus clouds which
  passed through the sky the day before contained familiar shapes. Informin
 g the songs accordin gly as he went\, Ben picked up on modes both musical 
 and lyrical\, threading backward through the time of Six Organs of Admitta
 nce. Almost marinating in it as a way of life. Working on the music and th
 e vocals\, then spending some time with them while steppin g away from the
 m. Walking the dog and coming back to them. Time is Glass is made of that 
 kind of time. Alone time. Recorded in the visceral environs of home\, Tim
 e is Glass is sharply focused\, even as misty impressionist mountains floa
 t through the background. Sweet and spiny\, “ The Mission ” sings its 
 purpose\, before turning abruptly to the orchestral rumble of “ Hephaest
 us ”: rural industrial psychedelia\, ecosystem goth\, synths arcing to l
 ift a helplessly earthbound community into the firmament above. Winding al
 most imperceptibly back into song with “ Slip Away ”\, the time of the
  record becomes clear\, moves fluidly\, relaxed but aware\, from event to 
 event. People and things coming around again. The intuit\, passing through
  wormholes and time\, sounding deep then dissolving into the universal. Th
 e acoustic sounds ringing\, layered suddenly\, then clear again. Explosion
 s of a new kind of distortion. Ecstatic melodies. Communing. The space of 
 a day. The space of a season. Time is Glass\, and Six Organs of Admittanc 
 e is here and will be here\, again.\nTASHI DORJITashi Dorji  is a Bhutane
 se guitarist and improvisational musician known for his avant-garde and ex
 perimental approach to music. Tashi’s own skewering of guitar traditions
  has developed an idiosyncratic take on the instrument\, one defined by mo
 vement and profound openness to technique. \n

 oors8 PM – Show\nFUTUREBIRDS\n“I’m movin’ on\,” Daniel Womack si
 ngs during the first minute of Easy Company\, an album that finds Futurebi
 rds — once the best-kept secret of Athens\, GA’s music scene\, now a b
 eloved act on a national scale — back in the driver’s seat\, speeding 
 together toward some new horizon.Momentum. Evolution. Expansion. Those are
  important traits for a critically-acclaimed group that recently celebrate
 d its 15-year anniversary. “When you’ve been a band for as long as we 
 have\, there’s a lot of moving on\,” says Thomas Johnson. “We just k
 eep going\, because that’s how you keep things fresh. That’s how you k
 eep the spark.” By matching the sharply-written songs of three distinct 
 frontmen with a progressive mix of rock & roll\, electrified folk\, and co
 smic American roots music\, Futurebirds have built an audience that’s as
  wide as the band’s own sound. With Easy Company\, Futurebirds’ fifth 
 studio album\, that sound reaches a new peak.Featuring four songs apiece f
 rom singer/songwriters Womack\, Johnson\, and Carter King\, Easy Company f
 eels like a celebration of the tight-knit bonds that have held Futurebirds
  aloft since 2008. Back then\, the guys were college students at the Unive
 rsity of Georgia\, building a buzz around town with shows at fraternity ho
 uses and local bars. Years later\, they’ve become headliners at bucket-l
 ist venues like The Ryman and The Fillmore\, collaborating with fellow gen
 re benders like My Morning Jacket’s Carl Broemel along the way. They tea
 m up with new partners on Easy Company\, which was recorded with producer 
 Brad Cook in the border town of Tornillo\, TX. The guest list includes Wax
 ahatchee’s Katie Crutchfield\, who trades verses with King on the album
 ’s title track\, and Drive-By Truckers co-founder Patterson\, who delive
 rs a spoken-word monologue during “Soft Drugs.” A brass section even m
 akes a brief appearance. The result is a bold blend of old and new\, deliv
 ered by a band of brothers who’ve never sounded so invigorated. Easy com
 pany\, indeed.\nCOLOR GREEN\nFor the California-based quartet Color Green\
 , playing music together is all about stepping into the unknown. “When w
 e play live\, I don’t really know what’s going to happen\,” says Noa
 h Kohll\, one of the band’s two guitarists and four vocalists. “You re
 ally have no idea what you’re going to get with this band\, which keeps 
 things fresh for us and maybe makes the live experience special.” In a v
 ery short time\, they have developed a word-of-mouth reputation as a dynam
 ic and unpredictable live act\, grounding their cosmic jams in earthy melo
 dies and drawing from ’60s SoCal folk-r0ck\, ’70s classic rock\, ’80
 s underground rock\, ’90s psychedelic dance-rock\, and any other sound t
 hat catches their ears.\n

 oors8 PM – Show\nSAM BURCHFIELD\nSam Burchfield was raised in the foothi
 lls of the Blue Ridge Mountains of South Carolina\, where he learned to pl
 ay and learned to write. His youth was steeped in the mossy creeks and dee
 p ravines of those ancient woods\, and they imbued him with the gift of so

 orgia mountains and continues to find inspiration in the rivers and ridges
  of Southern Appalachia.His latest album ‘Me & My Religion’ was produc
 ed with his touring band\, The Scoundrels. It is the first collaboration f
 or the group after years of paying dues to the highway. Colin Agnew (drums
 )\, Trygve Myers (bass)\, and Ryan Plumley (guitar) accompanied Burchfield
  to Muscle Shoals\, Alabama along with Nashville producer\, Rachael Moore\
 , to record the album of 7 days.This 10 track album is almost equal parts 
 Americana\, psychedelia\, indie folk\, and Southern rock. All these flavor
 s combine to support the album’s main theme. As seasoned listeners will 
 expect\, Burchfield’s lyrics are far from on the nose\, as the declarati
 ve title would suggest. ‘Me & My Religion’ is an exploration of mankin
 d’s toil for meaning in a world of vapid consumerism and commercialism 
 – one in which we have become deaf to our own harmony with nature. Despi
 te the weight of these ideas\, the album feels like a lighthearted sojourn
  through the backwoods of our imagination.\nLEON MAJCEN\nLeon Majcen is a 
 musician whose story is one of resilience and determination. He grew up on
  the Gulf Coast of Florida\, the son of Bosnian war refugees who had fled

 above a slow-burn\, sparse synth\, conjuring a tipsy loneliness\, a hazy r
 ecollection\, a disco ball spinning at the end of the night for an empty d
 ance floor. Sun June’s music often feels like a shared memory – the de
 tails so close to the edge of a song that you can touch them. And as an Au
 stin-based project\, their music has also always felt strangely and specif
 ically Texan – unhurried\, long drives across an impossible expanse of o
 penness\, refractions shimmering off the pavement in the heat.But on Bad D
 ream Jaguar\, Sun June is unmoored. The backdrop of Texas is replaced by l
 onging\, by distance\, by transience\, and a quiet fear. The only sense of
  certainty comes from the murky past. It’s a dispatch from aging\, when 
 you’re in the strange in-between of yourself: there’s a clear image of
  the person you once were and the places you inhabited\, generational curs

 DOORS\n9PM SHOW\n \nDIRTY DOLLHOUSE \n\nDirty Dollhouse is the multi-gen
 re music of Philadelphia-based artist Chelsea Mitchell\, a folk chanteuse 
 with classical training and a retro-pop composer with a soft spot for cou
 ntry. After releasing her first lo-fi EP\, Married in the Aviary\, Mitchel
 l received the Tri-State Indie Vocalist of the Year award and the lyrics t
 o her song “Nobody’s Daughter” were showcased in American Songwriter
  Magazine. Joined by light accompaniment for a follow-up EP\, 25 Shades\, 
 saw a departure from traditional folk and embraced a Nashville vibe while 
 2017’s full-length album Vinyl Child was a mixture of darkly contemplati
 ve pop songs and quiet\, intimate confession. Drawing from many muses has
  produced a uniquely diverse catalogue\, but it has also made it near-impo
 ssible to pin down who Mitchell sounds like. In sultry-toned moments you m
 ight hear Nicole Atkins\, a soft bird-like peak could make you think of Ka
 cey Musgraves\, and a certain belt may summon Brandi Carlile. Though her v
 ocals range from soft twang to unabashedly operatic\, it could suffice to 
 say that Mitchell’s songs all fit under the same “singer-songwriter”
  umbrella as her lyrics weave a diary page to life and her band expands on
  structural simplicity with subtle grace. As bassist Joshua Machiz\, drumm
 er Eric Lawry\, and lead guitarist August John Lutz II are now full-time m
 embers\, Dirty Dollhouse has found a new and exciting momentum\, opening f
 or rising stars like Nikki Lane and Amanda Shires and playing to a wider a

 iting cathartic pop tunes from a punk heart. Having moved over 10 times in
  her life\, dropped out of college\, ended and started new relationships\,
  Bren knows a thing or two about unexpected change. Breaking through self-
 doubt is a common theme throughout her writing. Distilling influences rang
 ing from Elliott Smith to Mitski to the Pixies\, Bren’s music shares fam
 iliar sentiments of vulnerability and introspection\, serving as your comp
 anion for feelings you may not have even realized you had.\n \nDOMINY\n\n

DESCRIPTION:\n\nTHE BRET TOBIAS SET \nBret cut his teeth co-fronting the 
 Bigger Lovers\, a Philly guitar pop group that swung for the fences in the
  aughts. Dude re-emerged in 2023 with a set of flinty\, sharply observed n
 umbers that have deeply resonated with dozens. Bret’s songs are typicall
 y 1) dyspeptic 2) tender\, or 3) self-immolating\, at times simultaneously
 . His deep bench of talent includes Krista Umile (harmonies/keys)\, Tracy 
 Stanton (bass)\, Jeff Tanner (skilled guitar)\, Mike Kennedy (tubs) and\, 
 occasionally\, Patrick Berkery (also tubs). \n\n \nMANDY VALENTINE\nNeve
 r taking themselves too seriously\, Philadelphia-based 6+ piece Mandy Vale
 ntine brings a new approach to some classic country and rock & roll themes
 . With galloping rhythms\, close harmonies\, and lyrics like\, “I see a 
 whippoorwill\, oh\, start to fly and feel so lonesome\, baby\, I could cry
 ”\, Mandy Valentine evokes mid-century country icons such as Hank Willia
 ms\, Elvis Presley\, and the Everly Brothers while treble-drenched guitars
 \, female-forward vocals\, and catchy hooks recall 60s pop like The Shangr
 i-Las and The Orlons. Put together\, Mandy Valentine is “a little bit co
 untry and a little bit rock n roll”. \n \nALL THE LIVING AND THE DEAD\
 nAll the Living and the Dead is a five-piece\, Philly-based indie pop rock
  band that blends the energy of rock with multi-layered vocal harmonies. F
 ormed in 2022\, the members have played in and around the Philly scene in 
 bands such as The Bigger Lovers\, Mason Porter\, Missing Palmer West\, and
  Space Ate Mafia. \n

 eking self-improvement\, we parse through our inner angels and demons\, de
 signating our better tendencies as core parts of our identity and dismissi

  a tricky and disingenuous prospect — often further muddied by capitalis
 m\, armchair psychologists and religious zealots — but it’s also an es
 sential\, life-affirming process worth enduring. Box for Buddy\, Box for S
 tar\, the latest album from This Is Lorelei\, explores this conundrum\, fu
 nctioning both as an earnest transformative exercise and a tongue-in-cheek
  takedown of the illusion of transformation.Since 2012\, New York City sin
 ger-songwriter Nate Amos (Water From Your Eyes\, My Idea) has recorded and
  self-released hundreds of songs under the This Is Lorelei moniker\, and p

 unedited diary entries\,” written and recorded without much forethought\

 That could be physical pain\, emotional pain\, familial pain\, but it’s 
 there in cycles.” On her piercing and profound new EP\, The Ceiling Coul
 d Collapse (due July 15th\, 2022\, via Fantasy Records)\, Bobbitt picks th
 rough the dizzying rubble of folk and indie rock for moments of resonant e
 motion and frames them in heartbreaking lyrics and openhearted expanses.\n

 the close-knit group of Al Menne\, Dylan Hanwright\, Cam LaFlam\, and Pat 
 and Carrie Goodwin – didn’t know if they would go on. After starting o
 n the follow-up to Four of Arrows\, each member was called in different di
 rections\, some to new countries\, new jobs\, new life stages. But as Menn
 e puts it simply\, “Time passed and I missed my friends.” As any good 
 relationship built on mutual love\, trust\, and a mountain of shared histo
 ry\, the quintet—who grew up in Seattle and have been making music toget
 her for a decade—were drawn back into one another’s orbits in 2023.  
 Great Grandpa recently made their highly-anticipated and “epic return”
  (Brooklyn Vegan) with the gorgeous track “Kid\,” and “Doom” is an
 other cathartic entry in the band’s beloved catalog. Penned by Pat Goodw
 in soon after the release of 2019’s acclaimed Four of Arrows\, the song 
 swirled in the band’s consciousness\, taking on many iterations before b
 eing officially recorded in 2024. “Doom\,” produced by guitarist/engin
 eer Dylan Hanwright and Goodwin\, is the bands’ first self-produced trac
 k since 2017’s Plastic Cough. It sees the band at the furthest end of th
 eir prog/math-rock spectrum — at times embracing the odd time signatures
  and heavy electric guitar of their early years while expanding on the dar
 k\, knotty chamber-folk of Four of Arrows. And now\, with these two new tr
 acks and a run of tour dates on their belt\, Great Grandpa continues. Thes

 oors9 PM – Show\nESTHER ROSE\nEverything clicks on Safe to Run\, the fou
 rth album from singer\, songwriter and perpetual searcher Esther Rose. It
 ’s the quiet culmination of years spent fully immersed in a developing a
 rtistry\, and presents Rose’s always vividly detailed emotional scenes w
 ith new levels of clarity and control. As with previous work\, her songwri
 ting transfigures the chaos and uncertainty of a life in progress\, but he
 re she sharpens the pop elements and attaches unshakably catchy hooks to e
 ven the darkest stretches of the journey.After spending her formative year
 s in Michigan\, Rose relocated to New Orleans and got her start in music t
 here while awash in the unparalleled energy of the city’s scene. Over th
 e course of her first three records\, an infatuation with traditional coun
 try gradually evolved into a more distinctive style and increasingly perso
 nal material. Rose’s music traced her changes as she moved through stag
 es\, studios\, and home addresses\, and she eventually left NOLA for New M
 exico where the two year writing process for Safe to Run unfolded. Making 
 the transition to this new environment after spending the better part of a
  decade building a life somewhere else demanded looking around and taking 
 stock. All the heaviness\, sweetness\, levity\, and self-discovery that ha
 d led up to that point began funneling into new songs that moved slower in
  order to dig deeper\, taking on the intricate hues of a desert horizon as
  they came together.\nTWAIN\n“There is nothing remarkable about my life 
 that is necessary to know in order to appreciate the songs\,” says Matth
 ew Davidson of Twain. He describes the project as “a modern folk-opera o
 f indefinite length consisting of songs and images from my life\, a self-c
 aricature of the musician and writer Matthew Davidson.”Twain made his la
 bel debut with Rare Feeling in 2017. The album was aptly hailed by NPR as 
 “at once human and otherworldly\,” by Consequence of Sound as “devas
 tating\, delicate\, meditative\,” and by Uproxx as “cosmic folk\, brig
 ht and sparkling\, but with all the caterwauling and rough bits that the m
 ost stoic traditionalist might desire.” Following the beloved release\,
  Twain played Newport Folk Festival and toured alongside artists including
  Buck Meek\, Langhorne Slim\, and Courtney Marie Andrews. Davidson is a fo
 rmer member of The Low Anthem and Spirit Family Reunion and a contributor 
 to Big Thief\, whose latest album Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in Yo
 u features Davidson’s distinct contributions on six songs. \n

 ors9PM – Show\n \nNAKED GIANTS\nWhen Naked Giants formed in 2014\, the 
 Seattle trio—vocalist/guitarist Grant Mullen\, bassist/vocalist Gianni A
 iello and drummer Henry LaVallee—were all eighteen years old\, and full 
 of the reckless\, restless energy of youth. A decade on\, both they and th
 e world have changed immensely. Shine Away—the band’s third full-lengt
 h\, following on from 2018’s SLUFF and 2020’s The Shadow—is very muc
 h an acknowledgement of that. It’s an album that doesn’t just reflect 
 on the personal life and times of the three of them and the world at large
 \, but casts a discerning\, self-reflective eye on what it’s like to be 
 in\, and be\, Naked Giants. It’s the sound of a band coming into\, and b
 ecoming\, themselves. Of course\, that’s a never-ending process\, but fo
 r the first time in their career\, Naked Giants are taking stock of their 
 journey—who and what they were\, are\, and want to be.  \n“Our first 
 record was still running on fuel from starting the band as 18 year olds wi
 th a rock’n’roll dream\,” says Mullen. “Since then\, life has chan
 ged. We all got day jobs or went back to school\, and really grew into our
 selves individually.  Before\, we were anxious to express ourselves in wh
 atever way we could through music. Now\, we have more to say\, and I think
  we’ve made a record with more meaning and purpose.”\nDespite these pe
 rsonal changes Shine Away contains the same sense of impetuous urgency tha
 t defined SLUFF. and the band’s preceding 2016 debut EP\, R.I.P.\, and w
 as still to be found within the fabric of The Shadow’s songs\, too. So w
 hile the band might be removed from their younger selves\, there are still
  traces of those people in these nine songs.\n \nGIRL AND GIRL\nSub Pop
 ’s latest signing is Girl and Girl: lead singer/songwriter Kai James and
  his Aunty Liss (Melissa James) on drums\, supported by Jayden Williams on
  guitar and Fraser Bell on bass. The four-piece garage rock outfit from Qu
 eensland has a kinship that shines through in their music and in their ele
 ctric live shows – Kai’s magnetism backed by Liss’ 37 years of drumm
 ing experience. With infectious hooks and surprising emotional intensity\,
  Girl and Girl is an undeniably good time.\nNamed as one of the TheMusic.
 com.au‘s ‘Top 25 Rising Acts of 2021’\, Girl and Girl won the inaugu
 ral Gold Coast Music Prize in 2022. The band supported Dry Cleaning on a n
 ational tour of Australia before embarking on a debut European Tour includ
 ing showcase performances at The Great Escape\, support dates with Blondsh
 ell and an appearance at London’s uber hip Wide Awake Festival.\nIn 2023

 t port city of Sekondi-Takoradi\, in the Western Region of Ghana. His earl
 y fascination with music blossomed into a lifelong passion. From mastering
  his father’s flute at the tender age of eight\, to honing his guitar sk
 ills under the mentorship of “Uncle Bonku”\, Sammy Lartey and Ebo Tayl

 st the zenith of Ghana’s highlife era\, Ambolley emerged as a pivotal fi
