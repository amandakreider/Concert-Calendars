DESCRIPTION:\n*All events are 21+ valid ID required for entry*\n \n7PM –
  Doors8PM – Show\n \nGROCER Grocer is a band from Philadelphia. Lead by 
 three distinct vocalists\, they pendulate between moments of brash atonali
 ty\, saccharine pop sensibility\, and rhythmic acrobatics. Their compositi
 ons are both meticulous and volatile\, while their live performances are l
 auded for explosive chemistry with cheeky curiosity. On their most recent 
 full length Number’s Game the band rearranged the puzzle pieces of 90s-i
 nfluenced rock and dissonant pop into something utterly their own. Now bui
 lding on a landscape of polyrhythms and chromaticism that their fans have 
 grown to cherish\, they explore new sonic structures in their forthcoming 
 EP Scatter Plot. Across its six tracks\, Grocer reiterates they are just a
 s comfortable with glassy earworms as they are with angular dissonance. Th
 ey remain giddy\, furious and singularly themselves.\nWASHER Washer is a r
 ock band originally from Brooklyn\, NY featuring Mike Quigley on guitar/ba
 ss/vocals and Kieran McShane on drums. Since forming in the late months of
  2013\, the duo have become a staple of the local DIY scene\, another hard
  working band playing countless shows throughout the eastern and central U
 S. They’ve garnered a strong reputation in that time thanks to the band
 ’s scrappy energy and infectious indie leaning garage punk anthems. Impo
 ssibly catchy and deceptively complex\, Washer’s songwriting stays with 
 you\, burrowing deep into the recesses of your mind as the band aim to “
 do a lot with a little”. Punk rock minimalism at its finest.\nSHANNEN MO
 SERDespite spending most of the last decade living\, working\, and nurturi
 ng their craft in the city of Philadelphia\, Shannen Moser’s sound remai
 ns rooted in their upbringing in rural Pennsylvania. Tributes to the pasto
 ral hillsides of Berks County echo through their music\, evoking images of
  learning to sing along to Townes Van Zandt in the passenger seat of their
  dad’s pickup or along with the Sacred Harp choirs in Quaker meeting hal
 ls. In 2014 Moser packed up their roots\, along with influences from freak
 -folk artists like Joanna Newsom and early Animal Collective and moved to 
 Philadelphia to focus on recording and performing. Those privy to these pe
 rformances and recordings quickly became captivated by a sound that was bo
 th haunting and infectious\, showing promises of songwriting genius and a 
 powerful voice.\n

 nADVANCE BASE\n \nAdvance Base is the melancholic soft rock recording proj
 ect of Chicago\, IL singer/songwriter Owen Ashworth (formerly of Casiotone
  for the Painfully Alone). Using a two-handed arsenal of electric piano\, 
 Omnichord\, samplers\, effect pedals & drum machines\, Ashworth builds min
 imalist\, heavy-hearted\, & nostalgia-obsessed ballads around his conversa
 tional baritone. The warm\, electronic sound of Advance Base has been desc
 ribed as “lo-fi\,” “depressed” & “weirdly uplifting.”\n \nAnim
 al Companionship\, the third & most recent “studio” album by Advance B
 ase\, was released September 21\, 2018 by Run For Cover Records / Orindal 
 Records. GoldFlakePaint & Various Small Flames both listed Animal Companio
 nship among their favorite albums of 2018. Since then\, Advance Base has r
 eleased Wall of Tears & Other-Songs I Didn’t Write\, a home-recorded col
 lection of (mostly) country/Americana covers arranged for electronic instr
 uments & Live at Home\, a collection of mid-quarantine livestream concert 
 performances & the closest representation of an Advance Base live set comm
 ercially available. A new single titled ”Little Sable Point Lighthouse
 ” was released on March 31\, 2022.\n \n \n \nYOUNG MOON\n \nTrevor Mont
 gomery is a craftsman. By day he’s a skilled tile setter\, a job taxing 
 to both the mind and body. By night he’s an equally meticulous and hard 
 working musician\, coaxing just the right tones out of his vintage drum ma
 chines and synths to carry his tales of love and redemption. As a tile set
 ter and as a musician\, his job is the same: assembling things of beauty t
 o fill empty spaces. Gifted with a somber baritone\, Montgomery returns wi
 th a new album under his Young Moon moniker entitled Colt. Having been in 
 bands such as San Francisco post-rockers Tarentel and solo under the monik
 er Lazarus (Temporary Residence)\, in 2012 Montgomery released Navigated L
 ike the Swan\, his first album under the Young Moon moniker. According to 
 The Wall Street Journal “It engulfs the listener—and sometimes even th
 e narrator…”\, while Consequence of Sound called it “…powerful and
  heartfelt…”\n \n \n \nKRISTIN DAELYN\n \nPhiladelphia indie folk art
 ist Kristin Daelyn roots herself in the comfort and simplicity of folk\, u
 sing fingerstyle guitar and intimate storytelling as the foundation of her
  music.  Each piece creates a tender world of melancholy and warmth\, emo
 ting through layers of ambient arrangements and layered vocal swells.\n \n
 Daelyn self engineered and produced her first two albums “Waning” and 
 “Gardens and Plantings”.  Recording both albums at home\, she invites
  you into an almost private space to share personal musings and experience
 .\n \nHer most recent single “You Loved Me Anyway” was released in Jan
 uary and was featured on WXPN\, Gems on VHS and Various Small Flames.\n

 hidden treasure” by Stereogum\, Mal Blum writes cleverly crafted songs t

  a Minneapolis-based indie punk trio of best friends: Keytarist and bassis
 t Taylor Kraemer (she/they)\, guitarist KT Branscom (they/them)\, and drum
 mer Katie Fischer (she/they). VIAL has brought their genre-bending cascade
  of sound into electrifying live performances since their formation (On Ti
 nder\, mind you) in mid-2019. They’ve got songs that smack you in the fa
 ce: Rage-written speedruns about running over misogynists (“Roadkill”)
  and head-bopping\, cheek-blushing queer love songs to tingle your toes (
 “Violet”)\; VIAL is a powerhouse who knows how to adapt their sound\, 
 and themselves\, allowing them to grow in new ways during 2020’s days of
  quarantine by creating a wide audience on TikTok and other social media w
 hile revving up to release their blossoming debut album\, LOUDMOUTH (2021)
 . This record was highly anticipated after the success of their debut EP\,
  “Grow Up\,” which hit streaming sites soon after the group’s format
 ion in late 2019. \nFollowing the release of LOUDMOUTH\, VIAL has made an
  explosive return to live music\, playing historic venues across Minnesota
 \, including First Avenue’s iconic main stage\, and have hit many of the
 ir favorite cities while supporting artists such as FIDLAR\, HUNNY\, and J
 hariah. \n \nJOHN-ALLISON WEISS\nJohn-Allison Weiss is a singer/songwrite
 r living life on their own terms. Born in Michigan and raised in Georgia\,
  they started making music in high school and never stopped. Their career 
 started online where they made lifelong fans through MySpace and Tumblr\, 
 lonely hearts across the globe who found solace in their soft songs and ho
 pe in their louder ones. From 2010-2020 they toured relentlessly\, sharin
 g the stage with everyone from Lou Reed to Letters to Cleo. They wrote son
 gs with heroes like Tegan Quin and Kevin Devine and took their music to tw
 o more continents with tours in the UK and Australia. Flying just under th
 e radar\, Weiss earned a cult following and the respect of peers like The 
 Wonder Years\, Into It. Over It.\, Now Now\, The Front Bottoms\, Jenny Owe

 After her time on The Voice\, Zo formed Velvet Rouge. In March of 2023 the
  band was WMMR’s Local Shots Artist of the Month. They have performed at
  an eclectic mix of Philly’s music venues\, including a sold-out show at
  Johnny Brenda’s\, Brooklyn Bowl\, and World Cafe Live. Velvet Rouge has
  also had the opportunity to perform on WXPN for National Public Radio Day
  2022\, as seen in NPR Music.\nIn 2022\, Gina Zo was inducted into the Rec
 ording Academy Philadelphia Chapter and has set out on a journey to put he
 r mark on rock n roll. In late 2022\, Velvet Rouge was voted Best Rock Ban
 d in Philly by PHL Live & was featured in the March issue of Philly Style 
 Magazine as the music to listen to in the Now section – where they were 
 titled “Philly’s Hottest Rock Band”.\nAs they prep for their EP rele
 ase in early 2024\, they have been recording at Philly’s top studios wit
 h Brian McTear and Amy Morrissey (War On Drugs\, Sharon Van Etten\, and Dr
 . Dog) at Miner Street Recording\, Tommy Joiner at Milkboy Studios\, and M

 s still very much alive. You can feel it in the raw energy of Desoto Jones
 \, a band which blends contemporary sound with the roots of American Rock.
 The ragged intensity of Desoto Jones is reminiscent of the early days of g
 runge and alternative\, but is also pleasantly sophisticated\; the band sk
 illfully fuses ear-grabbing melodies with soulful\, introspective lyrics. 
 Their music is an inquest of candid expression\, but the band doesn’t tr

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nREMEMBER SPORTS\n \nAfter four al
 bums of expertly crafted pop punk\, Remember Sports follows up last year
 ’s epic Like a Stone with the first EP of their decade-long run. Recorde
 d piece meal in their respective homes\, sometimes together\, sometimes ap
 art\, Leap Day trades the live immediacy of their studio classics for some
 thing cozier\, though no less rousing. The core trio of Carmen Perry\, Cat
 herine Dwyer\, and Jack Washburn have always kept up active home recording
  practices for their solo projects–Carmen as Addie Pray\, Catherine as S
 pring Onion\, Jack under his own name–and here we find them gently foldi
 ng sounds sprung from their bedrooms into their signature brand of basemen
 t rock. Absent a dedicated drummer for the first time in their recorded hi
 story\, the band opts for simple drum machine accompaniment\, lending the 
 music a fresh weightlessness even as Carmen’s arresting vocals and sharp
  lyrics bring gravity in all their righteous anger\, scathing self-reproac
 h\, and disarming tenderness. Musically\, all the thrilling guitar riffs a
 nd grooving bass lines we’ve come to expect are here\, but the gradual r
 ecording process offered the band more opportunity to explore and experime
 nt\, adding on subtle layers of instrumentation\, distortion\, and electro
 nics\, and with them a warm sense of depth. In all\, Leap Dayis a short an
 d sweet\, loose but confident affair\; at once a reminder of Remember Spor
 ts’ absolute mastery of the pop rock anthem and a tantalizing sip from t
 he well of ideas they have yet to plumb.\n2ND GRADEFor Peter Gill (Friends
 hip\, Free Cake For Every Creature)\, the fearless leader of Philadelphia 
 power-pop group 2nd Grade\, being our full\, open selves means we can be a
 s sincere as we are sarcastic. New album Hit To Hit is about wearing your 
 heart on your sleeve but at arm’s length. It’s about being both earnes
 t and ironic. It’s playing with different selves yet managing to coalesc
 e them into one identity\; a self-aware and self-reflexive identity that m
 akes the characters concocted by Gill amusing\, relatable and insightfully
  authentic.\n

 9PM – Show\nMOLLY RINGWORM\n \nMolly Ringworm is an indie rock band from
  New Jersey. What started as front woman Sarah Holt’s diaristic solo pro
 ject in 2015 has since solidified into a full band effort with guitarist a
 nd cousin Johnny Zappas\, bassist Andrew Simpson and drummer Michael Auble
 . Described as “Breeders meets Liz Phair to go to lunch with Pavement\,
 ” the band pairs nuanced narratives with dynamic arrangements. \n \n \
 n \nDedicated to doing-it-themselves\, their first full band EP\, Good Ol
  Boys\, was recorded and mixed by the band in their homes over the course 
 of 2019. The EP topped the local college radio charts and led them to open
  for Faye Webster that year. Molly Ringworm released their latest EP\, Se
 ems\, on Kidokoro Records in March of 2022. Despite being recorded remote
 ly during the course of the pandemic\, the 20-minute track list manages to
  deliver the quartet’s wagon-sized sound and their sharpest songwriting 
 to date. \nUGLI\nCalling UgLi’s music “ugly” is too easy. Sure\, th
 eir songs are rough and ragged like the torn edges of construction paper. 
 Sure\, they are noisy\, blown-out in all the right ways\, with only Durant
 e’s caterwaul piercing their melodic mass. Sure\, genre labels like “i
 ndie” or “alternative” don’t do enough to capture what the band ac
 complished in their self-released 2021 debut FUCK\, nor do more specific l
 abels like “punk-rock” or “power-pop” seem accurate enough. For no
 w\, DIY will have to do. UgLi’s follow-up girldick. shows a band more in
 -control of their chaos. The EP was ritten in the wake of FUCK’s unexpec
 ted momentum\, which stirred up new thoughts and feelings in Durante and h
 er bandmates. UgLi’s latest is nothing if not loud\, unapologetic\, and 
 unafraid. But UgLi’s music is about more than making an expressive\, emo
 tional racket\; it’s about seeing someone like you onstage\, hearing the
 m on a slab of vinyl\, and knowing that you could pick up a guitar and do 
 the same.\nPALE SHADE\nPale Shade is a shoegaze/slowcore group from Philad

 – Doors8:30PM – Show\n \nHURRY\n \nWhen Matt Scottoline formed his ban
 d Hurry in 2012\, he wasn’t even sure what power pop meant. “I only fo
 und out what it was because of Hurry’s drummer [Rob DeCarolis]\,” Scot
 toline says. “When we first started the band\, he was like\, ‘Oh\, thi
 s is cool power pop music.’ I had no idea what he was even saying.”\n 
 \n“Power pop” describes some of the greatest music ever made. If abuse
 d\, it can also describe some of the worst music ever made. Everyone wants
  a piece: The septuagenarians who dress like magicians and blow their pens
 ions on Rickenbacker 12-strings and mink fur fedoras\; the studded belt 
 ’77 set who are like the Exploding Hearts but bad\; and\, of course\, em
 o and pop-punk bands who claim the genre in an attempt to attract listener
 s who aren’t children.\n \nThese days\, Scottoline knows exactly what po
 wer pop means\, which is the inevitable byproduct of making it and engagin
 g with its fervid fandom. It is loud\, generally mid-tempo\, hyper-melodic
  electric guitar music–and he is exceptionally good at it\n \nOne popula
 r hypothesis is that power pop experiences brief bursts of popularity betw
 een more dominant music trends. And like the perverse seismologists strain
 ing at the leash in anticipation of The Big One\, Scottoline has been pred
 icting the genre’s latest resurgence for years. “Every time I put out 
 a record\, I would tell [Lame-O Records]\, ‘I think this is it. I really
  think this is the year that power pop is going to come back.”\n \nScott
 oline is finally getting his flowers. Over the pandemic a scene of relativ
 ely young power pop bands coalesced on the social media platforms relative
 ly young people use (i.e.\, Twitter and Instagram\, not Facebook and the S
 teve Hoffman message boards). At the center of this Neo International Pop 
 Overthrow is Hurry—and at the center of Hurry is Scottoline\, whose late
 st album with the band\, Don’t Look Back\, proves you can make effortles
 s\, earnest\, irresistible double-P without getting hung up on semantics.\

  Doors8PM – Show\n \nSACRAMENTUM\nSacramentum is a melodic black/death m
 etal band from Göteborg\, Sweden and was formed in 1990. The band was ini
 tially named Tumulus\, although shortly before the release of their demo 
 “Sedes Impiorum”\, their name was changed to Sacramentum.\nTheir first
  official release was the MCD “Finis Malorum”\, which was self-finance
 d\, recorded in 1994\, and re-released one year later (in 1995) by the Fre
 nch label Adipocere Records. Their positively-received MCD was followed in
  1996 by their first full-length album “Far Away From The Sun”. This d
 ebut album came out to near-unanimously positive reviews and is still rega
 rded as one of the finest melodic black/death metal albums. Their subseque
 nt albums\, 1997’s “The Coming of Chaos” and 1999’s “Thy Black D
 estiny” focused less on a melodic death/black metal sound and more on a 
 fusion of black\, death and thrash metal. Little was heard from them after
  the “Thy Black Destiny” album\, except some live performances in 2001
 .\nThe silence was broken in 2019\, when they announced their return. They
  have been booked for a few festivals in 2020 at which they will be perfor
 ming “Far Away From the Sun” in its entirety. In addition\, they have 
 announced a new full-length album which is to be entitled “Shadow of Obl
 ivion”.  Sacramentum embarks on their first ever US tour\, supported by
  Crossspitter\, in support of the Century Media re-release of their sophom
 ore album\, “The Coming of Chaos.”\n \n\nCROSSSPITTER\nPhiladelphia\, 
 PA\nWILD BEYOND\nWild Beyond was formed amidst pestilence and conspiracy 2
 021 in Philadelphia\, PA. Comprised of Edward Gonet\, Jim Viola\, and Evan

 s the motto for Speedy Ortiz’s dauntless new collection of songs\, Twerp
  Verse. The follow-up to 2015’s Foil Deer\, the band’s latest indie ro
 ck missive is prompted by a tidal wave of voices\, no longer silent on the
  hurt they’ve endured from society’s margins. But like many of these t
 ruth-tellers\, songwriter\, guitarist and singer Sadie Dupuis scales the c
 areful line between what she calls being “outrageous and practical” in
  order to be heard at all.\n \n“You need to employ a self-preservational
  sense of humor to speak truth in an increasingly baffling world\,” says
  Dupuis. “I call it a ‘twerp verse’ when a musician guests on a trac
 k and says something totally outlandish – like a Lil Wayne verse – but
  it becomes the most crucial part. This record is our own twerp verse\, fo
 r those instances when you desperately need to stand up and show your teet
 h.”\n \nTwerp Verse was tracked in Brooklyn DIY space Silent Barn\, mixe
 d by Omaha legend Mike Mogis (Bright Eyes\, Rilo Kiley) and mastered by Gr
 ammy-nominated engineer Emily Lazar (Sia\, Haim\, Beck). The record pulls 
 from the most elastic pop moments in Squeeze’s Argybargy and the seesawi
 ng synth-rock of Deerhoof and the Rentals. With Dupuis on guitars\, vocals
 \, and synths\, supporting guitarist Andy Molholt (of psych pop outfit Las
 er Background) now joins Speedy veterans Darl Ferm on bass and Mike Falcon
 e on drums – and together they accelerate the band’s idiosyncrasy thro
 ugh the wilderness of Dupuis’ heady reflections on sex\, lies and audiot
 ape.\n \nDupuis\, who both earned an MFA in poetry and taught at UMass Amh
 erst\, propels the band’s brain-teasing melodies with her serpentine wit
 . Inspired by the cutting observations of Eve Babitz\, Aline Crumb’s bit
 ing memoirs\, and the acute humor of AstroPoet Dorothea Lasky\, Dupuis cra
 ftily navigates the danger zone that is building intimacy and political al
 lyship in 2018. Now as public pushback against the old guards reaches a fe
 ver pitch – in the White House\, Hollywood and beyond – the band fires
  shots in disillusioned Gen Y theme “Lucky 88\,” and casts a side-eye 
 towards suitors-turned-monsters in the cold-blooded single “Villain.” 
 Closing track “You Hate The Title” is a slinky traipse through the ban
 ality of this current moment in patriarchy – in which survivors are give
 n the mic\, but nitpicked over the timbre of their testimonies. “You hat
 e the title\, but you’re digging the song\,” Dupuis sings wryly\, “Y
 ou like it in theory\, but it’s rubbing you wrong.” Tuned smartly to t
 he political opacity of the present\, Twerp Verse rings clear as a bell.\n

 ors8PM – Show\nCHRIS PUREKAIt’s rare for an artist to bridge the divid
 e between critical acclaim and dedicated fan engagement. Chris Pureka is a
  Portland-based singer-songwriter whose body of work has resonated deeply 
 with these seemingly disparate milieus. Her music has straddled the folk\,
  americana and indie rock genres over the course of her 20 year career\, a
 nd over that time\, her bold vulnerability in processing the intimacies of
  life in song has struck a chord with those listeners who crave authentici
 ty and depth.\n \nChris’s elegant emotionality as a vocalist and her fla
 ir as a lyricist have garnered her favorable comparisons to Chan Marshall\
 , Bruce Springsteen\, and Patty Griffin. Over many years of touring on bot
 h sides of the Atlantic\, she has shared the stage with such diverse and e
 steemed artists as The Lumineers\, Gregory Alan Isakov\, The Cowboy Junkie
 s\, Haley Heynderickx\, and Ani DiFranco. She has had her songs featured o
 n such television shows as Brothers and Sisters\, Covert Affairs and Shame
 less and well as a song featured in the Sundance featured indie film\, The
  Royal Road. Along the way\, Chris has remained truly independent\, sellin
 g nearly 50\,000 albums through her own label\, Sad Rabbit Records.\nKYM R
 EGISTER (OF MELTDOWN RODEO)Sometimes the process of mining for melody in w
 ords eviscerates the raconteur\, gutting them like a tornado through a tra
 iler park. Sometimes\, “the truth” is a revival of shit rather forgott
 en\, igniting a coward’s desire to look away. With “Meltdown Rodeo\,
 ” Kym Register foregoes such consolatory diversions for visceral scrutin
 y and unbroken stares. The result is a body of tunes that forages the Amer
 ican south\, dislodging its ducked bullets from pearly white sand. \nAccor
 ding to Register\, “Scottsboro\,” the album’s opener\, was years in 
 the making. It recounts the little known history of “The Scottsboro Boys
 \,” nine Black men falsely accused of raping a pair of white women in hy
 perpyrexic 1930’s Alabama. One accuser eventually admitted the allegatio
 ns were bullshit\, but\, for Black men in the Jim Crow south (as it is now
 )\, any assumptions of guilt are soon proven a permanent brand. Register w
 ails against America’s foremost refrains –jury and peers and whole tru
 ths– in lyrics hefty with reconciliation and metaphor. “A blind eye\, 
 A blind eye is all justice knows/ Of the truth of what happened in Scottsb
 oro/ Come on now\, this story’s not that old.” Contrary to Register’
 s demand for account\, the American south knows no shame. \nWhether grappl
 ing with the constrictions of gender expressions on dating apps (“How Do
  You See Me”)\, evoking the semi-autobiographical loneliness of Dorothy 
 Allison’s Carolina bastards (“Maureen”)\, or daring white folks to 
 “get right with their history of compliance in racial capitalism” (“
 Loamlands”)\, Register affirms that songwriting\, at its best\, is a gro
 ss but necessary confrontation. Ultimately Register and Meltdown Rodeo (bo
 th the newly named band and album) have achieved in eleven songs something
  the south has only half-heartedly attempted – undoing generational curs
 es by retiring “bless your heart” lip service. \nDamn if we can’t al
 l benefit from a little melting down.\n

  hell\, that there is no future\, that all hope is lost. I wanted to explo
 re those depths and see where it lead me.” Hopelessness aside\, the col
 lection of songs represents a big leap forward. With addictive hooks at ev
 ery possible turn\, Dolphins (the 9th record in the catalogue)\, stands ou
 t as quite likely the strongest and most articulate Islands album yet. Nic

 living\, often simultaneously\, while stripping the music down to its simp

 snappy kick and snare firing off against a persistent\, hooky guitar line.

  spareness. There’s an evocative wooziness within each song\; a disorien

  Doors8PM – Show\n \nHAND HABITS\n \nThere is a moment halfway through H
 and Habits’ Fun House at which musician Meg Duffy asks the question\, 
 “How many times must I rewind the tape?” It’s a fitting question pla
 nted squarely in the middle of a sonically adventurous record concerned la
 rgely with making sense and taking stock. How much time must we spend exam
 ining our own past in order to fully understand it? How can we safely ackn
 owledge pain in order to release it and fully actualize who we are suppose
 d to be? Buffeted by strings\, synths\, and a gently-shook tambourine\, th
 e aptly-titled track\, “The Answer\,” highlights the emotional engine 
 at the heart of the record. “I know t… Duffy sings\, “Here’s what 
 I hope to find – it’s always mine.”\n \nFun House is Duffy’s most 
 ambitious Hand Habits album to date. Produced by Sasami Ashworth (SASAMI) 
 and engineered by Kyle Thomas (King Tuff)\, the record was not intended as
  a reaction to the pandemic\, but it was very much the result of taking a 
 difficult\, if much-needed\, moment of pause. “When the pandemic happene
 d\, everything stopped\,” recalls Duffy. “I had been touring consisten
 tly for five years\, both on my own and playing in other people’s bands\
 , so I wasn’t really writing a lot in between. It had been full pedal to
  the metal in terms of traveling and scheduling\, which meant I really did
 n’t have a lot of time to think about how I felt or really check in with
  myself. Then\, when the world basically stopped\, it turned out to be the
  longest I’ve been alone in my entire life – without being in a relati
 onship\, without being on the road\, without working myself to exhaustion 
 – and the result was really like\, holy shit. I slammed on the brakes an
 d everything psychologically that I’d been pushing down and ignoring for
  the past few years suddenly flew to the foreground.”\n \nWhat started o
 ut as a very personal reckoning eventually blossomed into a fruitful and c
 onvenient means of making new music. Grounded in LA and sharing a house wi
 th Ashworth and Thomas\, who also runs a studio space in the building\, Du
 ffy began to flesh out the songs that would eventually become Fun House. E
 mboldened by going into therapy and coaxed by Ashworth to push the songs i
 nto unexpected new shapes\, the resulting music was more acutely personal 
 and stylistically adventurous than anything they had attempted before. The
  new songs also became a prism through which Duffy could begin to self-act
 ualize in a new way.\n

 s Endless Summer”—CIVIC joyfully obliterate the line between furious c
 atharsis and unbridled fun\, introducing a vital new energy into today’s

  garage rock\, punk\, and ’90s-style noise-rock\,” CIVIC inject every 
 song with a visceral urgency hinting at their shared history in the local 
 hardcore scene. As frontman Jim McCullough recalls\, the band first took s

 ired by iconic Australian punk acts like Radio Birdman and The Saints. “
 We were in a bowling alley in Japan and came up with a very strong focus f

 und but get a little more thoughtful with the melodies and songwriting\,
 ” says McCullough. Upon returning from Japan\, McCullough soon recruited
  a full lineup featuring Lewis Hodgson and bassist Roland Hlavka. Within s

 hiladelphia in early 2023 when the latest bit of bad news arrived: His gra
 ndfather\, a native of that very city\, was dead. It wasn’t entirely une
 xpected. For years\, Tommy Burt had struggled with early-onset dementia\, 
 slipping away a bit more each time Burt saw him. Burt even began recording
  his grandfather\, letting his tape recorder roll as they had some of thei
 r final conversations. He wanted to preserve those moments\, however repet
 itious or fragmented they might be\, before the opportunity vanished forev
 er. In fact\, Traffic Fiction—Burt’s third album on Oh Boy Records and
  an unexpected musical reinvention rooted in his new and idiosyncratic ver
 sion of classic soul—also preserves their relationship by committing ano
 ther key piece of it to tape. The soul that animates so many of these 14 t
 racks? That was the music shared by grandfather and grandson.\n \nBurt’s
  California childhood was not easy. His parents split when he was young\, 
 so he would often shuttle between their houses in Sacramento and the Bay A
 rea. He was a bit of a wild child\, too. From time to time\, though\, he w
 ould accompany his father to work at a plant nursery\, riding shotgun in a
  1975 Cadillac Seville as they listened to The Delfonics and Otis Redding\
 , Marvin Gaye and The Temptations. Those drives were his sanctuary\, that 
 music their blessed score. \n \nBut as Burt became a musician himself\, h
 e was a peripatetic troubadour\, tapping into American folk and blues part
 ly as a matter of necessity—it’s not sensible to busk\, after all\, wi
 th some sophisticated band at your back. Bits of those other roots and com
 positional ambitions finally emerged on 2021’s You\, Yeah\, You\, the vi
 vid result of Burt’s first proper studio sessions. On Traffic Fiction\, 
 they are in full bloom\, from the sweet country-soul surrealism of the tit
 le track to the skywriting rock of “2 For Tha Show\,” Burt as urgent a
 nd commanding as he’s ever been. Traffic Fiction is the sound of Burt co
 nfidently bending a sentimental past to his present will.\n

 – Doors8 PM – Show\n \nCHAI: We The Chai Tour! Since breaking out in 
 2018\, CHAI have been associated with explosive joy. At their live shows\,
  the Japanese four-piece of identical twins MANA (lead vocals and keys) an
 d KANA (guitar)\, drummer YUNA\, and bassist-lyricist YUUKI have become kn
 own for buoyant displays of eclectic and clever songwriting\, impressive m
 usicianship\, matching outfits\, delightful choreography\, and sheer relie
 f. At the core of their music\, CHAI have upheld a stated mission to decon
 struct the standards of beauty and cuteness that can be so oppressive in J
 apan. Following the release of 2019’s second album PUNK\, CHAI’s adven
 tures took them around the world\, to music festivals like Primavera Sound
  and Pitchfork Music Festival\, and touring with indie-rock mainstays like
  Whitney and Mac DeMarco.\nFONTFont started playing shows in Austin in the
  spring of 2022. By the time they released “Sentence I” that November\
 , their frenetic\, collagist live shows had gained enough notoriety to reg
 ularly fill rooms. They draw inspiration from art rock\, dance music\, pos
 t punk\, disco\, and electronic music. “Font believes that ‘the medium
  is the message\,’” writes Mars Salazar in the Austin Chronicle\, “
 …culminating in this radical act being a favorite among other musicians 
 in the underground scene.” Font is composed of Thom Waddill\, Jack Owens
 \, Anthony Laurence\, Logan Wagner\, and Roman Parnell.\n

 e Scranton\, Pennsylvania-based band Tigers Jaw\, is an ode to living in t

 d scrolls by each of us at an alarming speed\, the ability to maintain a s

 peless Records—finds members Ben Walsh (vocals/guitar)\, Brianna Collins
  (vocals/keyboards)\, Teddy Roberts (drums)\, and Colin Gorman (bass) at t
 he height of their powers\, fusing their collective skills with the synchr
 onicity and energy the band honed over several years of non-stop touring. 
 The result is a back-to-the-basement approach elevated by the unmistakable
  production of their longtime friend and collaborator Will Yip. The band
 ’s most sonically ambitious and lyrically affecting album to date\, I Wo
 n’t Care How You Remember Me sees a newfound freshness and creative free
 dom crystalizing the lush and dynamic world of Tigers Jaw.\n \n \n \nYOWL
 ER\n \nYowler is the Philadelphia-based solo project of Maryn Jones\, who 
 has been recording and releasing music online and in burned cd\, tape and 
 record form since as early as 2004. What started out in 2013 as a conceptu
 al project where dark thoughts and too-quiet moments could be placed\, Yow
 ler has become a main outlet for Jones’ songwriting. After most recently
  being a part of the loud pop outfit All Dogs as songwriter\, and long-tim
 e member and multi-instrumentalist in the psych-folk group Saintseneca\, J
 ones has been focusing her musical time and energy on writing for Yowler\,
  and collaborating with Philadelphia-based producer and engineer Kyle Gilb
 ride to create the forthcoming Black Dog in My Path.\n

 \, the new A Giant Dog record\, one’s conception of what an A Giant Dog 
 record sounds like bends like space and time around a starship running at 
 lightspeed. \n \nThe biggest point of departure is that Bite is a concept
  album\, concerning characters who find themselves moving in and out of a 
 virtual reality called Avalonia. You’re thrown into it quickly\, as a ca
 lm\, robotic voice says\, “Welcome to Avalonia\, happiness awaits inside
 ” over a crushing synth line that segues into an opulent string arrangem
 ent. \n \n“Welcome to Avalonia” sounds like the birth of a new world\
 , and sonically\, it is. A Giant Dog’s first album of original songs sin
 ce 2017’s Toy\, Bite finds the band—Sabrina Ellis\, Andrew Cashen\, Da
 nny Blanchard\, Graham Low\, and Andy Bauer— at their peak as musicians\
 , challenging themselves with more complex arrangements and subject matter
  that forced them out of their heads and into those of the characters who 
 occupy this supposed paradise. \n \n“Within our previous albums\, the s
 ubject matter\, the lyrics are all very personal\, based on our experience
 s—self-centered\, even\,” Ellis explains. “In making this conceptual
  album\, we had to find ourselves within\, or project ourselves into\, the
  principal characters. We developed them\, got to know their minds\, emoti
 ons\, and motivations\, and then expressed those in nine songs. The songs 
 aren’t demonstrative as in musical theater. Instead\, the songs are heat
 ed moments\, internal expressions that stand on their own.”\n

 irst met while playing in a touring band for another Norwegian artist. Dur

 he three met in Bergen\, located along the west coast of Norway\, to start
  working on ideas and demos. Instead\, within just a few days\, they ended

  propelled them forward\, resulting in a recor d deal\, their live debut a
 s a band at Norway’s biggest pop festival Øyafestivalen and the release

 international interest and praise from outlets including Atwood Magazine\,

 or the recording of their third album\, Death Bells have returned Between 
 Here & Everywhere\, an effort that captures the cross-section of Southern 
 California’s shadowy hidden interzones\, outside of the lights and luxur
 y.\n \nThe record features nine new songs that represent Will Canning and 
 Remy Veselis’ continual growth\, as well as accompaniment by an experien
 ced cast of contributors on keys\, strings\, piano\, and operatic backup v
 ocals. Recorded with Colin Knight at Paradise Studios\, and mixed by Mike 
 Kriebel at Golden Beat\, Between Here & Everywhere bristles with immediacy
  and emotion\, with every element tactile\, balanced\, and elevated.\n \nB
 LACKWATER HOLYLIGHT\n \nEmpty surrounds all of me . It’s a poignant line
  from the third album by Blackwater Holylight that encapsulates the search
  for self when suddenly everything has changed. There’s a theme of proce
 ssing vast personal trauma throughout Silence/Motion that eloquently — b
 oth lyrically and musically — and simultaneously embodies the crushing e
 mptiness\, sorrow\, strength and rebuilding of recovering from personal de
 vastation. \n \n“There was so much grief both in the world and interper
 sonally during the process of creating Silence/Motion \,” says vocalist/
 bassist Allison “Sunny” Faris. “The four of us gave one another more
  space to be ourselves\, to experiment with each other’s ideas and to be
  gentle with one another more than we ever have before. So\, we knew this 
 tenderness would manifest in extremely honest arrangements\, and I think t
 hat you can hear that throughout the record.” \n \nCuriously\, consider
 ing the dark times in which it was created\, this is the band’s most mel
 odic and catchy music so far. Blackwater Holylight\, as the name suggests\
 , is all about contrasts: It’s a fluid convergence of sound that’s hea
 vy\, psychedelic\, melodic\, terrifying and beautiful all at once. And\, S
 ilence/Motion finds the band honing those contrasts\, letting ideas and mo
 ods fully develop from song to song\, rather than filling every song with 
 a full range of their capabilities. It allows the band to go fully prog-ro
 ck here\, and simply stay hushed and intimate there. There’s a new confi
 dence to the band in how seamlessly they wield their stylistic amalgam.\n

 bout this work\,” says Pile’s Rick Maguire about All Fiction. It’s h
 is band’s eighth record\, and one that finds the ambitious group assembl
 ing its most texturally complex material yet—despite the fraught inspira
 tion underscoring its restive lyrics. Alongside the blistering drums and s
 corched-earth riffs that first galvanized Pile’s dedicated fanbase\, the
  band has incorporated elegiac strings\, mystifying vocal corrosions\, and
  haunting synths. From the creeping fear of cinematic opener “It Comes C
 loser” to the euphorically ascending keys on ego-shattering closer “Ne
 on Gray\,” All Fiction is an ornate\, carefully paced study on the subje
 ctivity of perception\, the data-shaping despotism of big tech\, and the c
 onnections between anxiety and death. In its most vital moments\, it’s a
 lso a resolute recommitment to the restorative significance of art and ima
 gination.\n \nFor fifteen years\, Pile’s evolving take on rock has earne
 d the group one oft-repeated superlative: “your favorite band’s favori
 te band.” Ceaseless touring took its members from Boston’s basement ci
 rcuit to international festivals\, hitting loftier technical apexes with e
 ach new record. Maguire—the fastidious composer\, evocative guitarist\, 
 and potent voice behind the solo-turned-punk project—gives musical body 
 to his interior world in scream-along-able lyrics that skew surreal. \n

 8PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nUNDERGANG\n \nUNDERGANG was form
 ed in the summer of 2008 in the heart of Copenhagen\, Denmark\, and was th
 e creation of long needs for creating raw and ignorant heavy death metal\,
  something that wasn’t as widespread in the international\, and even les
 s national\, extreme metal scene at the time. Formed and driven with the p
 assion for the genre and little care for other people’s acceptance and i
 nterest\, the band wrote and recorded what they intended to be their debut
  album “Indhentet af døden” during the winter of 2008/2009\, supporte
 d by having played a variety of local shows in the Danish capital region. 
 The debut album eventually got released in January 2010 by the UK based ne
 wly founded label Me Saco Un Ojo Records and a little later the Spanish la
 bel Xtreem Music\, with whom they signed a contract for the first and seco
 nd album. 2010 and 2011 was spent playing various shows and festivals arou
 nd Europe and even their first appearance in the US on a 2011 West Coast t
 our for three weeks around the Chaos in Tejas festival in Austin\, Texas. 
 The sophomore album “Til døden os skiller” was released on LP/CD in F
 ebruary 2012 and supported by a European tour the same month and two month
 s later a support job in Brooklyn in New York opening for death metal lege
 nds AUTOPSY.\n \n \n \nHaving cut down on touring activities in recent ye
 ars\, for both obvious and personal reasons\, UNDERGANG are now returning 
 to the US for the first time since 2017 to play a small selection of speci
 al shows with friends of the band – where this shared with PISSGRAVE and

 ody is a temple. For Miasmatic Necrosis\, proclaiming its rotting pews and
  rafters is just the beginning of a pilgrimage toward transcendence throug
 h the esoteric rites of corpus in extremis. The quartet’s fervor is evan
 gelized through death metal-inspired goregrind\, reverential to the spirit
 s of early Carcass\, Regurgitate\, and Dead Infection. \nOn debut LP Apex 
 Profane\, instruments are calibrated to bowel-loosening timbres\, yet slic
 e with the precision of scalpels as a triumvirate of pitch-shifted pontifi
 ces preaches sermons of suppuration. Ecstatic devotees describe it as “b
 arbarous\,” “destructive” (From Corners Unknown) and “filled to th
 e brim with mood and depravity” (Boston Hassle). Since offering this eme

 “You’re My Lover Now is a population explosion. Songs fling shards of 
 narrative about dozens of characters: lovers\, friends\, schoolkids\, pare
 nts\, depressives\, liars\, strivers\, even party goers tootling kazoos”
 . Christina Black of Time Out New York said\, “Insecurity and existentia
 l crisis are the dominant themes on You’re My Lover Now. The album’s p
 sychological tales are presented in a disjointed\, stream-of-consciousness
  manner\, infused with anxious-sounding arrangements.” The Teeth also re
 ceived much critical acclaim for their live shows.  Daytrotter wrote\, 
 “[The Teeth] comprise the wiliest\, most inventive and shakingest live r
 ock and roll band that this green earth has ever had the privilege of clai
 ming.” After the band broke up in 2008 their music was resurrected and i
 ntroduced to a whole new audience of people with the song “Ball of the D

 oxes were inundated with messages asking\, “will the teeth ever play aga
 in?”. One year ago the answer would certainly have been “no”.  But 
 for all of those that hoped it would finally happen\, The Teeth are gettin
