 t rock ‘n’ roll is about. That feeling. That’s what the ladies at Vi
 xen77 have harnessed. A bona fide punch in the face. Major influences such
  as The Stooges\, TheRunaways\, and Johnny Thunders are channeled to creat
 e fast-paced\, no fucks given sound that will put you on your ass.Philadel
 phia punk rock ‘n’roll comin’for your soul.Their demos found their w

 randen King and Mattie Klauser use their chemistry off-stage to kick ass o
 nstage\, acquiring an irrefutable reputation for an energetic live show th

 rejoice in what it means to be surviving as a poor and rowdy SpiceGirl gen
 eration person\, seeing Philly as inspiration for both music and attitude.
  The Swigs let the litter and grime seep into their chords\, lyrics\, and 
 stage presence\, crafting catchy hooks about having a good time living bel
 ow the poverty line that make you wonder why you ever cared about the faca
 de of high-class elitism. The Swigs do something deliberate with their mus

  citywide\, throwing a house party\, and dismantling the oligarchy.\nROARI
 NG SHELL (9:00 PM)\nThe Roaring Shell is a Philadelphia-based band\, but m
 ore than that\, an idea. The delicate and the ferocious lie side by side i
 n an intertwining embrace. They explore universal concepts of time\, love\
 , fear\, and hope in modern pocket symphonies. Melodies that scratch the i
 tch in your brain\, rhythms that do the same to your body. Together the Ro
 aring Shell become a sort of cult wherein everything is sacrificed for the
  good of the music. Colorful\, beautiful\, a little brash\; they live for 
 the song. Everything lives for the song. Join us.\n

 s8PM – Show\nArs Nova Workshop Presents\nPEEESSEYE\n \nPeeesseye was for
 med in 2002 in Brooklyn by Chris Forsyth\, Jaime Fennelly\, and Fritz Welc
 h. Though their instrumentation changed as often as their sound\, the core
  elements were always Fennelly’s combination of harmoniums\, oscillators
  and feedback\, Forsyth’s alternately spacious and cutthroat guitar play
 ing\, and Welch’s hyper-mutated vocals and possessed percussion.\n \nThe
 y persistently kept listeners off balance over the course of the ensuing d
 ecade\, both through chameleonic stylistic shifts from one release to the 
 next as well as with the unpredictable eclecticism of the music itself. Ge
 stural lowercase formalism might explode into blaring noise\, sprawling ps
 ychedelia shatter into raucous free improv\, back porch minimalism mutate 
 into avant-trickster performance art—all engaged with a sense of emotion
 ally engaged intensity that forged a unity in their often evolving sound.\
 n \nThe group splintered geographically and musically after a final show i
 n Antwerp in 2011\, with Fennelly pursuing theatrically Kosmiche synth gle
 am as Mind Over Mirrors from bases in Washington State\, Chicago\, Maine\,
  and North Carolina\; Forsyth carving out his own territory as a bandleade
 r and lyrical guitar anti-hero upon relocating to Philadelphia in 2009\, m
 ost notably with his Solar Motel Band\; and Welch shifting from music/nois
 e/sound to various performance scenarios to visual art extrusion in his ad
 opted hometown of Glasgow\, Scotland.\n \nAfter more than a decade apart\,
  Peeesseye is reconvening for two performances to mark the 20 years since 
 they first made noise together.\n \n \n \nTALSOUNDS\n \nNatalie Chami is 
 a Canadian-born Lebanese American who adopted the TALsounds moniker in 200
 9 for her explorations in the drone\, ambient\, and improvisational discip
 lines. Through her masterful synth work\, operatic vocals\, and nuanced sc
 ulpting of mood and atmosphere\, Chami’s music strikes a balance between
  the extremely personal and the selflessly transportive.\n \nWith over a d
 ecade performing as a solo and collaborative artist based in Chicago\, inc
 luding collaborations with Haley Fohr (Circuit Des Yeux)\, Whitney Johnson
  (Matchess)\, and as a member of free music trio Good Willsmith\, Chami ha
 s emerged as a crucial contributor and one of the faces of the city’s co
 ntemporary avant-garde electronic scene.\n

 8PM – Show\n \nTHE AVENGERS\nIn 1977\, The Avengers established themselv
 es as one of the US’s preeminent punk bands. Fusing incisive guitar hook
 s\, explosive rhythms\, and adolescent venom\, the group forged some of th
 e most in-your-face songs of the era. Classics like “We Are the One” a
 nd “The American in Me” earned them a spot opening for the Sex Pistols
  at their final performance at Winterland\, as well as a dedicated followi
 ng that has only swelled during the subsequent years. The number of musici
 ans that count themselves indebted to the sneering indictments of vocalist
  Penelope Houston and the eviscerating chords of guitarist Greg Ingraham c
 annot be overstated. The current line up includes rock-solid bassist Joel 
 Reader (MTX) and the exhilarating drumming of Luis Illades (Pansy Division
 ).\nWhile much has been written about The Avengers in the past four decade
 s\, rock critic Greil Marcus puts it succinctly\, “The word I always com
 e back to is mystical\, and that remains almost theirs alone.”\nTHE BLES
 SED MUTHAS\nThe Blessed Muthas were once described as\, “a gang that pla
 yed music on the side”\, by detroit DJ Angela Woman. But\, in actuality 
 they are ordinary misfits from the same old mill playing Rock n Roll to ge
 t their thrills. The Muthas remain true to the early punk rock sounds of t
 he 70s. Influenced by NYC punk such as the Heartbreakers\, the NY Dolls\, 
 and the (NYC) Victims. Also influenced by bands like the Dead Boys\, and I
 ggy Pop. At times their influence ventures across the pond to English Punk
  such as UK Subs\, the Damned\, and so on. Get it? Gangs don’t always pl
 ay by the rules.\nIn the last 22 years the Blessed Muthas have opened up f
 or bands such as MC5/DTK\, Nikki Corvette\, Sonny Vincent\, UK Subs\, the 
 Breifs\, the Bell Rays\, the Zeros\, the (NYC) Victims\, and local Philly 
 punk legends Pure Hell\, Ruin\, and the Sick Kids. They continue to blaze 
 a trail of red hot hooligan Rock n’ Roll and musical mischief across the
  stages they encounter. So check them out! They are tighter than Lux Inter

  lines. Their 2016 EP was hailed as a beautiful new beginning for the band
  of friends. Journalist Julie Miller reviewed the songs as “majestic in 
 a somber\, soft way\, billowing up in a cloud of horns as Sarah Gulish’s
  vocals float in layers over top. The chamber rock of TVV’s songs still 
 ripples underneath\, but as New Enemies\, they’ve added a shiny gloss of

 here’s so many towns you can drive for 15 minutes and have no clue where
  you are\,” he says\, sitting in his home studio in Beacon\, New York\, 
 where he wrote the songs that make up Magic Sign\, the second solo album f

 lance joyful abandon with late night wistfulness. “Sailboat” hums with
  Yo La Tengo buzziness\; “Merlin” rolls with a gentle strut\; the afor

  a lot of first thought\, best thought\,” he says\, noting the album’s
  improvised guitar solos\, which sounds celebratory and striking. “I wan
 ted to make music I wanted to hear\, in a world that wasn’t so dark and 
 shitty\,” he explains.  \n \nThat hopefulness blooms on the love song 
 “Exit Music\,” which closes the record. “Though we’re not as young

 9PM – Show\n \nFRIENDSHIP (11:00 PM) Friendship’s Merge debut\, Love 
 the Stranger\, moves like a country record skipping in just the right spot
 \, leaving its fellow travelers longing for a place they’ve only visited
  in their dreams. Guitarist Peter Gill\, drummer Michael Cormier-O’Leary
 \, bassist Jon Samuels\, and hawkeyed balladeer Dan Wriggins map out the g
 roup’s particular\, breathtaking landscape and invite the listener to sh
 are in its glory.\n \nLove the Stranger’s invitation is all the more won
 drous because its characters have clearly been hurt before. “I need soli
 tude and I also need you\,” Wriggins reckons in “Ugly Little Victory.
 ” Wide awake\, vulnerable\, and gimmickless\, Friendship won’t hesitat
 e to confide in us\, or even ask for help when the moment calls\, like on 
 the lyrical centerpiece of “Alive Twice”:\n \nUnder your eyeball spell
 \, I was losing myself/ Not in the good way you used to talk about/ I reme
 mber a day\, Cedar Park Cafe/ I was in a bad place and you set me straight
 / With your on-the-nose advice\n \nBetween instrumental pit stops at “Ku
 m & Go” and “Quickchek\,” local references in Love the Stranger crea
 te a catalog of human perception\, presented as roadside attractions. From
  grape jelly residue (“Ramekin”) to the site of a demolished cathedral
  (“St. Bonaventure”) to King of the Hill quotations (“Smooth Pursuit
 ”)\, the record’s images craft a symbolic language of high and low Ame
 ricana\, both evocative and consistently accessible. Spending time with Lo
 ve the Stranger creates a community—one in which the window between the 
 listener and the music-maker shatters in full\, until all that remains are
  the fragments you decide to pick up together.\n \nTENCI (10:00 PM)\n \nTe
 nci began as Jess Shoman’s bedroom-folk project in Chicago in December 2
 018.\n \nWith the help of Spencer Radcliffe and Tina Scarpello it quickly 
 became something more fully-formed. By spring of 2019 they’d recorded th
 eir debut My Heart Is An Open Field.\n \nThey recorded the album in Radcli
 ffe’s home in just a couple months. Having played in the band\, he under
 stood the tenderness it needed to maintain. Half of the songs were written
  the week before. The album retains that spontaneity and rawness.\nFLANAFI
  (9:00 PM)\nFlanafi is the solo project of Simon Martinez\, Philadelphia e
 xperimental guitar wizard and the melodic half of Boiled Records alumni Pu
 lgas. These songs contain the same burbling junkyard genius of that band\,
  filtered through a very different lens. One could use Flanafi as a requir
 ed text in the economics of bombast with no reservations. It’s Sly Stone
  drowning in a liquor ocean – it’s Dntel style IDM made with washboard
 s and spoons instead of computers – it’s Colin Blunstone run through a
  chipmunk filter in a hell based on planet IKEA. This shit is weird and it
 ’s beautiful and it’s one of a kind. In an era where regurgitation and
  veneer hold sway\, this young freak is following his oddly sober muse. He
 ’s got the muse cornered and it’s not clear if he’s gonna set it on 
 fire or serenade it. He could do either\, really\, as Simon’s talent is 
 absolutely unparalleled in this new epoch. Rumour has it that each of his 
 fingers is individually sentient. He knows exactly what he’s doing. Soak
  it up.\n

 ss Presents\nBAD BAD HATS\n \nBad Bad Hats are an indie rock trio from Min
 neapolis\, Minnesota. Known for bringing a joyful\, exuberant presence to 
 their live shows\, touring with The Beths\, Margaret Glaspy\, The Front Bo
 ttoms\, Hippo Campus\, and Third Eye Blind\, the group took specific care 
 to bring their fun-loving spirit to their third LP\, Walkman. \n \nKerry 
 (guitar/vocals)\, Chris (bass)\, and Con (drums) let their collective hair
  down on Walkman\, bringing raucous and explosive riffs alongside witty ly
 rics. Though you might not notice from their indie rock exterior\, Bad Bad
  Hats draws a heavy influence from classic pop songwriting that shines thr
 ough in their hooky choruses and strong melodic sensibilities. \n \nTHE G
 ULLY BOYS\n \nThe Gully Boys origin story plays out like the perfect domin
 o effect. While sorting vintage clothes in a Minneapolis-area Ragstock in 
 2016\, Kathy Callahan (she/her) shared her dream of becoming a vocalist wi
 th Nadirah McGill (they/them). After encouraging a friend from middle scho
 ol\, Natalie Klemond (she/her)\, to join the trio on bass\, Nadi picked up
  a pair of drumsticks and counted off a cover of Best Coast’s “Girlfri
 end.” From there\, they had to master their instruments on the fly\, gro
 wing as creatives while blossoming with their first material. After their 
 debut EP landed online a year later\, Gully Boys released their debut LP N
 ot So Brave in 2018\, earning Best New Band honors from their hometown Cit
 y Pages and sharing the stage with everyone from The Hold Steady to Third 
 Eye Blind. The band’s Phony EP arrived in late 2019 on the edge of a scr

 – Doors8PM – Show\n \n \n \nL.A. WITCH (9:00 PM)\n \nL.A. Witch’s s
 elf-titled debut album unfurled like hazy memories of late night revelries
  in the city center creeping back in on a hungover Sunday morning. Guitari
 st/vocalist Sade Sanchez purred and crooned over jangling guitar chords\, 
 painting pictures of urban exploits\, old American haunts\, and private es
 capades with a master’s austerity. Bassist Irita Pai and drummer Ellie E
 nglish polished the patina of the band’s vintage sound\, adding a full-b
 odied thump and intoxicating swing to the album’s dusty ballads\, ominou
 s invitations\, and sultry rock songs. The album had an air of effortlessn
 ess\, like these songs were written into the fabric of the Western landsca
 pe by some past generation and conjured into our modern world by three pow
 erful conduits. The band readily admits that L.A. Witch was a casual affai
 r and that the songs came together over the course of several years. That 
 natural flow hit a snag when the band’s popularity grew and they began t
 ouring regularly\, so a new strategy became necessary for their sophomore 
 album\, the swaggering and beguiling Play With Fire.\n \nWhere L.A. Witch 
 oozed with vibe and atmosphere\, with the whole mix draped in reverb\, son
 ically placing the band in some distant realm\, broadcast across some unkn
 own chasm of time\, Play With Fire comes crashing out of the gate with a b
 old\, brash\, in-your-face rocker “Fire Starter.” The authoritative op
 ener is a deliberate mission statement. “Play With Fire is a suggestion 
 to make things happen\,” says Sanchez. “Don’t fear mistakes or the f
 uture. Take a chance. Say and do what you really feel\, even if nobody agr
 ees with your ideas. These are feelings that have stopped me in the past. 
 I want to inspire others to be freethinkers even if it causes a little bur
 n.” And by that line of reasoning\, “Fire Starter” becomes a call to
  action\, an anthem against apathy. From there the album segues into the s
 imilarly bodacious rocker “Motorcycle Boy”—a feisty love song inspir
 ed by classic cinema outlaws like Mickey Rourke\, Marlon Brando\, and Stev
 e McQueen. At track three we hear L.A. Witch expand into new territories a
 s “Dark Horse” unfurls a mixture of dustbowl folk\, psychedelic breakd
 owns\, and fire-and-brimstone organ lines. And from there the band only ge
 ts more adventurous.\n \nCULT OBJECTS (8:00 PM)\nCult Objects are a Philad
 elphia post-punk trio with equal love for cacophony and melody. Featuring 
 Larissa Sapko on bass\, Charlotte Anne Dole on drums\, and Lauren Leilani 
 Iona on guitar and vocals\, their debut record Secrets of Pain-Free Living
  is all thrashing guitars and relentless drums\, screaming lyrics that are
  simultaneously vicious and vulnerable. You can find their music streaming
  on all platforms\, at cultobjects.bandcamp.com or through Philly based 
 punk distribution label World Gone Mad (worldgonemadrecords.bandcamp.com).

 s9:00 PM – Show\nDUMMY (11:15 PM)\n \nLos Angeles band Dummy refuses to 
 slow down. After releasing two cassette EP’s in 2020 (on Popwig and Born
  Yesterday respectively)\, Dummy’s debut full-length album arrives via C
 hicago’s Trouble in Mind Records. Employing pummeling guitars and celest
 ial ambience within the same breath\, the band folds a myriad of reference
  points into their drone-pop style. Influence from ‘60s melodicism and 
 ‘90s UK noise pop can be found woven in with inspiration from spiritual 
 jazz\, Japanese new age\, and Italian minimalism.\n \nDummy dodges the bro
 oding\, dark\, dramatic tropes of contemporary “artistic” music often 
 found in punk\, experimental\, and electronic\, instead insisting on joyou
 s and euphoric sonic palettes. They refuse to be artistically stagnant\, c
 ontinuously shifting their approach to writing across 12 tracks. Shaped by
  performances around Los Angeles in 2019\, songs like “Daffodils” and 
 “Fissured Ceramics” feature relentless driving energy and ample psyche
 delic noise. Elsewhere\, Dummy counterbalances the aggression with meditat
 ive synthscapes focused on sound design and studio experimentation\, like 
 on the motorik “X-Static Blanket”. Finally\, centerpiece “H.V.A.C.
 ” and the album’s final track\, “Atonal Poem”\, seek to synthesize
  these two poles\, offering multi-part journeys through uncharted sonic te
 rritory.\n \nIn contrast to blissed-out instrumentation\, Dummy’s sardon
 ic lyricism examines “the burden of modern life\, consumerism\, environm
 ental collapse\, alienation\, and other anxieties born out of living in th
 is absurd moment in history”. Interior design\, marine pollution\, the p
 sychology of commercial architecture\, and nuclear testing are all feature
 d subjects. Dummy’s restless creativity keeps them moving ever-forward\,
  continuously challenging themselves and pushing their sound into exciting
  and exhilarating places. This is – as the album title suggests – “M
 andatory Enjoyment”.\nLIFEGUARD (10:30 PM)\n \nChicago\, IL\nKNIFEPLAY (

 tin is a Chicago-born singer-songwriter who grew up in rural Wisconsin\, m
 ostly waiting for Billie Holiday videos to load on back-country dial-up or
  making trips in a busted Geo Metro to watch punk shows in Milwaukee. Trai
 ned as a hairdresser\, she didn’t have musical plans beyond joke singing
  harmonies over the radio. She fronted the acclaimed experimental-folk-pop
  sextet\, PHOX\, formed just outside Madison\, Wisconsin. Eventually\, Mon
 ica moved to LA because “Wisconsin is cold as f*ck”. She found herself
  a little periwinkle casita and is feeling freer than ever in the city of 
 misfits. She’s presently at work putting melodies to her “explorations
  in romantic f*ckery” with lowkey pop songs with blue note whispers\, so
 me golden-era Hollywood dramatics\, and psychedelic flickers courtesy of a
  theremin. Monica is still figuring out who she is\, but quite happy to sh
 are her cautionary tales: “I made hundreds of mistakes so you don’t ha
 ve to.” \n\n \nJAKE SHERMAN (9:00 PM)\n \nBorn in Boston\, JAKE SHERMAN
  learned classical piano by listening to his father play Bach every mornin
 g. If not for an intervention – stumbling upon the catalog of Weird Al Y
 ankovic at 11 years old – he would have followed in his father’s path 
 or perhaps become a jazz purist.  But Weird Al changed everything.   Jak
 e started a parody band and sang his newly-written lyrics to classics like
  “All Star” by Smashmouth and “Men in Black” by Will Smith\, along
  with composing new family classics such as “Amy\, You’re Turning 49
 ” and “Charles\, Charles Sherman.” \n \nFast forward some years bey
 ond his time studying at Berklee College of Music and it’s clear Jake ha
 s found a way to combine his appreciation of great songwriting with his pi
 ano/organ-playing prowess.   He has become a go-to musician on recordings
 \, and tours for artists including Meshell Ndegeocello\, Bilal\, Emily Kin
 g\, Blood Orange\, Benny Sings\, Doyle Bramhall II\, Gabriel Garzon-Montan
 o\, Andrew Bird and Nick Hakim.  Everything from gospel heavyweight Doobi
 e Powell’s “Close to You” to Chance the Rapper’s Grammy-winning so
 ng “No Problem” includes Jake’s work. \n \nMore recently\, while ba
 sed in Brooklyn\, Jake has re-tapped his well of musicality and songmaking
  to create his upcoming album\, Jake Sherman Gets Sexy.  Due March 2020\,
  the album is a journey through modern dating and relationships\, with a p
 oint of view that is somehow both poignant and Weird Al-esque. \n \n\n \n

  there they spent the better part of 10 years touring relentlessly before 
 migrating to Queens New York in 2014. With a live show known for its raw\,
  visceral energy and relentless assault – leaving little to no stoppage 
 between songs – they barreled through countless NYC haunts and DIY venue

 t live album\, recorded and released Arcade Fire’s international #1 albu
 m Everything Now\, earned his master’s degree in public policy from Harv
 ard\, hosted a series of touring town halls on local issues (police contra
 cts\, prison reform\, municipal paid sick leave\, voting rights)\, and spe
 nt time raising his three children.\n \nHe also found the time and inspira
 tion to write and record a new album\, Generations.\n \n“My first record
 \, Policy\, was a book of short stories\,” Butler says. “Generations i
 s more of a novel—despairing\, funny\, a little bit epic… A big chunk 
 of this record is asking: What’s my place in American history? What’s 
 my place in America’s present? Both in general—as a participant\, as w
 e all are\, in the shit that’s going down—but\, also extremely particu
 larly: me as Will Butler\, rich person\, white person\, Mormon\, Yankee\, 
 parent\, musician of some sort\, I guess. What do I do? What can I do? The
  record asks that question over and over\, even if it’s not much for ans
 wers.”\n \nWhile the songs on Generations contain their fair share of dr
 ead and regret\, there is ultimately a lightness that shines through Butle
 r’s music. That brightness is at its most intense when he and his solo b
 and—Miles Francis\, Sara Dobbs\, and Julie and Jenny Shore—perform on 
 stage. Their electricity is palpable throughout Generations\, with the bul
 k of the new songs having been worked out live. Wild synth production—gn
 arly bass synths with live drums—and anthemic backing vocals as on first
  single “Surrender” are punctuated by intimate\, direct moments: Butle
 r’s voice cracking on “Fine” as he conjures his ancestors\, and “P
 romised\,” a meditation on friendship\, how lives are built together\, a
 nd how and why they drift apart.\n \nGenerations was recorded and produced
  by Butler in the basement of his home in Brooklyn. Tracking finished in M
 arch 2020\, as New York closed down for the pandemic. Half the record was 
 mixed in Montreal by longtime Arcade Fire engineer Mark Lawson\, the other

 tive dyad that comes together with grace and truth. Years of collaboration
 \, cohabitation\, shared experience\, and separate but equally inspired co
 mmitments to utilitarian cultural work bind their disparate timbres togeth
 er into a singular aesthetic reality.\n \nThe two artists met\, appropriat
 ely\, as members of a large ensemble performing Terry Riley’s “In C\,
 ” for an annual concert organized by Bitchin Bajas at Chicago modern mus
 ic hub Constellation. Chiu’s musical CV to that point included work with
  bands like Icy Demons and Chandeliers\, but he was mostly known for his v
 isual and graphic design work as Some All None. Honer had primarily worked
  as an instructor in Chicago\, as well as a member of the ensemble Quartet
  Datura. Since relocating to Los Angeles\, Honer has become a first-call s
 ession player for the likes of Adrian Younge and Beyoncé and played on re
 cordings by Chloe x Halle\, Angel Olsen\, Fleet Foxes\, and Stanley Clarke
 \, among others. Chiu has generated a strong unit of regular musical colla
 borators that includes Celia Hollander\, Booker Stardrum\, Ben Babbitt\, D
 ustin Wong\, Takako Minekawa\, and Sam Prekop while designing album artwor
 k for International Anthem releases\, by Angel Bat Dawid\, Dos Santos\, an
 d Jeff Parker.\n \nThe duo’s latest release\, Recordings from the Ålan
 d Islands (2022\, International Anthem)\, was inspired by a 2017 journey 
 to the titular archipelago in the Baltic Sea between Sweden and Finland. C
 hiu and Honer were taken by the serene and strange quality of the place\, 
 where the sun doesn’t set in the summer and the network of miniature isl
 ands is traversed by ferry which\, according to Chiu\, “casts a surreal 
 horizontal movement through space and time.”\nASHLEY PAUL (9 PM)\n \nAsh
 ley Paul is an American multi-instrumentalist and composer based in London
 . Her intuitive process integrates free form song structures with a focuse
 d approach to sound. Using a complexity of instruments including saxophone
 \, clarinet\, voice\, prepared guitar and percussion she creates a delicat
 e palette\, uniquely her own.\nBOOKER STARDRUM (8 PM)\n \nBooker Stardrum 
 is a composer\, percussionist\, producer\, and educator. His compositions 
 are sculptural\, carved from the dense layering of instruments and manipul
 ated samples\, a pantonal harmonic sense\, and an intuitive approach to rh
 ythm. Stardrum has released three solo records (CRATER in 2021\, Tempora
 ry etc. in 2018 and Dance And in 2015). Temporary etc. is a highly pe
 rsonal amalgamation of electro-acoustics\, minimalism\, ambient\, jazz\, a
 nd contemporary experimental electronic music that “further solidifies S
 tardrum’s position as one of America’s most intriguing composers.”(T
 he Wire) CRATER expanded on the techniques of his previous effort with 
 “jaw-unhinging splatterdrum masterworks that seem to explode from Stardr
 um’s tactile performance.” (BoomKat)\n

 is the result of three years of writing\, and some considerable time spent

 ytiger has finally learned to surf with American Idyll\, although the surf
 board is cracked. Their music matches diverse and moody drum hooks (Josh G

 pop-polymath Grace Ives\, following 2019’s critically acclaimed 2nd. A
 fter writing and doing initial production on this collection of songs at h
 ome in Brooklyn\, Ives teamed up with co-producer Justin Raisen (Yves Tumo
 r\, Charli XCX) in Los Angeles to consummate Janky Star’s expanded vis
 ion.  Still only in her mid-twenties\, the record sounds like Ives grown 
 up: through the ten sophisti-pop tracks\, there’s more deliberate space 
 that lends breathing room to her most vulnerable\, exposed songwriting yet
 .  Throughout songs that are still full of punchy synths and unconvention
 al rhythms\, Ives uses the quiet spaces in between to honestly reflect on 
 her ongoing struggle to find stability and happiness.  Touching on sobrie
 ty\, overdoses\, and the desire to escape from the realities of modern lif
 e\, the record also focuses on the rewards of slowing down\, and finally f
 inding a home for herself in the ever-shifting world.\n \nIves’ penchant
  for poetic musings on specific details and references has always been par
 t of her enchantment\, but on Janky Star she finally settles into an ima
 ge that’s entirely her own.   “Everyone has a shitty star tattoo/stic
 k n poke\, that’s never perfect\, or is rough around the edges. A beauti
 ful thing to think about is that stars on earth look like blobs but in spa
 ce really defined structures\,” she explains.  This fully-formed versio
 n of herself is the album’s guiding light\, and sees Ives take confident
  steps towards deciding her own fate.  Both self-possessed and yearning\,
  insular and affecting\, Janky Star’s effervescent daydreams are ultima
 tely triumphant\, where ultimately the very act of surviving can be the bi
 ggest achievement of all.\n

  – Show\nDave Kiss Presents\nD.R.I.  (10:00 PM)\n \nWe are a punk/metal
  crossover band with our roots set in hardcore. Established way back in 19
 82\, we have about 10 CD’s & 2 DVD’s out on various labels and are con
 sidered to be one of the forefathers of speed metal and thrash punk music.
  We started out in Texas and moved to the Bay Area cause we heard the SF a
 rea had free food at the soup kitchens (from which the classic tune was wr
 itten!!!!!)\nWhen we started our influences were bands like Black Flag and
  the Dead Kennedys. In 1982\, our first release\, which was really a demo\
 , the 22-song 7″ EP\, kickstarted our career as a formidable hardcore ba
 nd. 22 songs in 17 minutes. Blistering fast\, with on-the-dime cuts\, and 
 vocals to match. Said to contain the first grindcore blast ever recorded (
 No Sense). This record was later pressed into an LP\, and was considered t
 o be our first official release even though it was only 17 minutes. The 22
 -song debut eventually was combined with our second release\, 1984’s Vio
 lent Pacification EP\, and came out on CD in the mid-eighties\, when that 
 technology reached indie labels.\nIn 1985 we started to listen to bands li
 ke Metallica & Slayer. Our second full length release Dealing with It\, sh
 owed a progression to the metal side of the music genre. This album also w
 as said to make an impact\, and helped start the crossover movement. “We
  fused together our influences\, and shoved into the DRI mold\, Dealing Wi
 th It is what came out”. DRI went on mixing its own brand of punk metal 
 releasing: Crossover\, Four of a Kind\, Thrash Zone\, Definition\, a live 
 album recorded in 1992\, before releasing Full Speed Ahead in 1996 \; our 
 last full length release. We have been re-issuing our old catalog with bon
 us tracks for the new millennium. We also got a bunch of Live DVD’s in t
 he works\, starting with the 1984 CBGB’s live DVD that came out in 2005.
  Summer of 2016 saw the release of the first new material in years. But Wa
 it..THERE’s MORE came out as a 7″/12″ and CD.\nThe band currently co
 nsists of original core members and song writing team\, Spike Cassidy (gui
 tar) and Kurt Brecht (vocals)\, along with Gregg Orr (bass) and Rob Rampy 
 (drums).We are that band with the skanker in the circle. You know\, the ru
 nning man. The mosher. We appeared on a Beavis & Butthead episode. We also
  held the Guinness Book record for fastest band in the world\, back in the
  day. We played with just about every major band you can name\, and most f
 estivals in our travels around the world for over three decades. We now ha
 ve over 120 DRI songs under our belt\, and still play about 35 or so when 
 we play live.\nHONEY (9:00 PM)Originally\, Honey wasn’t conceived as a f
 ull band project. It was more of a solo projectto serve as “therapy” f
 or singer / guitarist\, Jay Laughlin (Turning Point\, Godspeed). AsJay put
 s it\, “I’ve been playing in bands non-stop since the 8th grade (1986)
 . In 2017\, Ihad a couple of back-to-back shitty situations which put me i
 nto a seriously darkdepression. I thought maybe it was time to take a step
  back from playing in a band andbook some studio time to make a record for
  myself… by myself.” These sessions wouldtake Laughlin back to his roo

 sessed him to pick up a guitar and write songs in the first place.\n

  – Show\nR5 Productions Presents\nAN EVENING WITH WAND AND GUESTSwith vi
 suals by Mad Alchemist\nWAND Wand formed in late 2013 in Los Angeles\, CA
  and got right to work playing\, writing\, and conceptualizing a contraria
 n path forward–the only viable trail to follow for a rock band that form
 ed in the twenty-teens (and audaciously named itself Wand). The original c
 onfiguration of the band was Cory Hanson (guitar\, vocals)\, Lee Landey (b
 ass)\, Evan Burrows (drums) and Daniel Martens (guitar). This was the grou
 p that recorded the neuroplastic\, dusk-colored Ganglion Reef. Upon heari
 ng it\, the suits at GOD? Records demanded the opportunity to release it\,
  and the rest became irrevocable historical fact in 2014. That debut relea
 se launched a year of furious activity and near-constant touring\, and inc
 luded the recording and release of both their second and third albums: the
  strobing sledgehammer Golem (on In the Red)\, and the psilocybe flicker
  show 1000 Days (on Drag City). During this time\, Daniel left to focus 
 on raising his son\, and the remaining three members of Wand regrouped as 
 a trio\, with an auxiliary fourth piece for tours.\n \nFollowing a dizzyin
 g 100+ dates played in North America and Europe in support of 1000 Days\,
  Wand took a six-month deep breath at the beginning of 2016. Cory put toge
 ther a string laden solo album\, The Unknown Capitalist From Limbo (rele
 ased later that year)\, and Evan focused on writing and touring with his b
 and Behavior. Meanwhile\, Wand’s barely-perceptible pause had a deeper a
 genda—Evan\, Lee and Cory had sensed the need for a new alignment\, a fa
 bulous new mutation of the body Wand. Sofia Arreguin and Robbie Cody were 
 recruited to play keyboards and guitar respectively\, with the intention o
 f reimagining the band’s approach to writing and performance. A period o
 f intense woodshedding ensued\, both in the practice space and on stages a
 round the world\, out of which the records Plum and “Perfume” emer
 ged.\n \nThe writing process that evolved during the tumultuous seasons of
  Plum and “Perfume” incorporated a new emphasis on econo-jamming a
 nd democratic decision-making\; another new method of invention\, another 
 new mode of digestion. Plum dropped in the fall of 2017\, “Perfume”
  in the spring of 2018. With the success of this music\, the band forged 
 on with confidence\, stockpiling dozens of pieces and working them togethe
 r as a unit. They made the most of their 2018\, taking in deep bubbles of 
 time to tinker and experiment with their sound\, using several different s
 paces as well as their own home studio\, and patiently uncovering the exci
 ting alchemical balance that would bring all this work together as a whole
 . By the turn of autumn\, Wand had arrived at the width and breadth\, the 
 breathless wit of their new album—Laughing Matter.\n \nMAD ALCHEMIST LIQ

 9PM – Show\nWXPN Welcomes\n \nS.G. GOODMAN\n“No one escapes the marks 
 left behind when it comes to love or the absence of it\,” says singer-so
 ngwriter S.G. Goodman\, describing the inspiration behind her sophomore al
 bum Teeth Marks. “Not only are we the ones who bear its indentations\, b
 ut we’re also the ones responsible for placing them on ourselves and oth
 ers.”   When the Kentucky native released her debut album\, Old Time F
 eeling\, she was rightly coined an “untamed rock n roll truth-teller” 
 by Rolling Stone. The roots-inflected rock n’ roll record saw Goodman le
 nding her gritty\, haunting vocals to narrate the dual perspectives of her
  upbringing as the daughter of a crop farmer\, and a queer woman coming ou
 t in a rural town.  Now with Teeth Marks\, co-produced by Drew Vandenber
 g (Faye Webster\, Drive-By Truckers\, Of Montreal) in Athens\, Georgia\, s
 he picks up the threads of Old Time Feeling. But where her critically accl
 aimed\, Jim James-produced debut zeroed in on the South\, reframing miscon
 ceptions in slough water-soaked tones\, her latest album pulses with downt
 own Velvet Underground electricity\, shifting its focus inward – though 
 never losing Goodman’s searing and universal point of view. Teeth Marks 
 is what you might get if Flannery O’Connor and Lou Reed went on a road t
 rip.  Drawing influences from the aforementioned Velvets\, as well as Pa
 vement\, Karen Dalton\, and Chad VanGaalen\, Goodman brings 11 powerful vi
 gnettes to life\, with a sound that ventures deeper into indie rock and pu
 nk territory than she ever has before. Though Teeth Marks is a love album\
 , Goodman doesn’t aim her focus on romantic relationships alone. Instead
 \, she analyzes the way love between communities\, families\, and even one
 ’s self can be influenced by trauma that lingers in the body. Teeth Mark
 s is about what love actually is\, love’s psychological and physical imp
 rint\, its light\, and its darkness. It’s a record about the love we hav
 e or don’t have for each other\, and perhaps\, more significantly\, the 
 love we have or don’t have for ourselves. \n \nLE REN \n\n

 9PM – Show\n \nPORRIDGE RADIO\n \nPorridge Radio are one of the most vit
 al new voices in alternative music\, having gone from being darlings of th
 e DIY underground to one of the UK’s most thrilling bands in the space o
 f less than a year. Their barbed wit\, lacerating intensity and potent ble
 nd of art-rock\, indie-pop and post-punk sounds like little else around\, 
 and led their 2020 album Every Bad to make the nominees list for the covet
 ed Mercury Music Prize.\n \nFor frontperson Dana Margolin\, drummer Sam Ya
 rdley\, keyboardist Georgie Stott and bassist Maddie Ryall – who met in 
 the seaside town of Brighton and formed Porridge Radio in 2014 – global 
 recognition has been a long time coming\, after years of self-releasing an
 d music booking their own tours. In those eight years\, Dana has gained a 
 reputation as one of the most magnetic band leaders around with an ability
  to “devastate you with an emotional hurricane\, then blindside you with
  a moment of bittersweet humour” (NME). \n \nBut if Every Bad establish
 ed Dana’s lemon-sharp\, heart-on-sleeve honesty\, Porridge Radio’s thi
 rd album takes that to anthemic new heights. Waterslide\, Diving Board\, L
 adder To The Sky is the sound of someone in their late twenties facing dow
 n the disappointment of love\, and life\, and figuring out how to exist in
  the world\, without claiming any answers. It’s also catchy as hell.\nSE
 AN HENRY\nSean Posila\, who records under the moniker Sean Henry\, has bee
 n writing music since he was a kid. On A Jump from the High Dive\, his sec
 ond proper full-length\, childhood and adulthood coalesce to display his m
 ost confident and animated work to date. A Jump from the High Dive is a bu
 ndle of energy through a focused lens\, each song reminiscent of the stand
 out track on a gifted mix CD. \nAfter Sean returned home to suburban Conne
 cticut in 2019 (“New York had broken up with me”)\, he adopted a “re
 ligious 9 to 5” mentality: working on the record and listening to old hi
 p-hop and ‘90s alternative CDs in his car. “I was doing a lot of couch
  surfing\, living where I grew up in a Connecticut ghost town and touring 
 around the country. I was all over the place. Amidst trying to sort things
  out\, I wanted to make my version of a pop album.”\n

  \nBonny Doon emerged in 2014\, its four members pivoting away from their 
 punk origins to create something restrained and steeped in contemplation. 
 Songwriters Bill Lennox and Bobby Colombo expanded their ongoing collabora
 tion to include drummer Jake Kmiecik and bassist Joshua Brooks. From there
  Bonny Doon took form\, developing a sound indebted as much to musical tou
 chstones like Neil Young and the Silver Jews as it was to the emotional la
 ndscapes of their always changing hometown of Detroit.\n \nThe group recor
 ded what became a self-titled 7” in the summer of 2014\, tracked by Fred
  Thomas in his living room. A tape of 4-track demos\, “Classical Days an
 d Jazzy Nights\,” followed in 2015\, before reenlisting Thomas to record
  their texturally dense debut LP\, which melded their penchant for time-ho
 nored songcraft with production heavy on tape-delay and glowing\, roomy so
 nics. The album was released on Salinas in early 2017\, as the band was al
 ready deep into work on material for a follow-up. Working in a studio for 
 the first time\, they captured a more spare and vulnerable sound and signe
 d on with Woodsist to release the resultant album\, Longwave.\n

 d of Cameron Lew\, who manages to not only be the figurehead of the projec
 t\, but also writes\, records\, produces\, directs\, and edits every aspec
 t of the project. While the nontraditional approach may have lead to a mor
 e gradual growth of the project it has resulted in Ginger Root gaining a d
 evoted fanbase.\n \nAfter releasing their sophomore album\, Rikki\, in 202
 0 with much of it feeling lost to the moments of that year Lew decided to 
 take a step back and try to write a succinct project to try and keep liste
 ners engaged for as long as possible. The result of this redirection of en
 ergy was paired with a newfound influence from Japanese art and culture af
 ter Lew immersed himself while learning to speak the language. All of this
  was packaged and delivered on City Slicker in 2021. \n \nWith this batch
  of songs Ginger Root finally saw his hard work pay off in a major way. Th
 e project connected with a massive audience on the internet\, and resulted
  in songs like Juban District and Loretta exploding. Ginger Root’s inter
 net presence grew steadily as well with his youtube amassing 160\,000 subs
 cribers and his Spotify nearly hitting 1 million monthly listeners. \n \n
 The path to success did not come overnight\, but rather at a gradual pace.
  The project delivered it’s first album in collaboration with Acrophase 
 Record\, Mahjong Room\, in 2018 and really has not stopped since. Between 
 each project Ginger Root has played alongside tons of modern Indie standou
 ts like Khruangbin\, Durand Jones\, Omar Apollo\, The Marias\, and Hippo C
 ampus to name a few. \n \nNow Ginger Root sets out to deliver a complimen
 tary EP and continue to captivate fans with his rich visuals and lush soun
 ds that he seemingly never fails to deliver. The project at times feels mo
 re aptly consumed on VHS rather than vinyl. Nisemono arrives in September 
 of 2022 along with their first headline tour in America.\nKING PARI (8:00)
 \n \nKing Pari is an almost accidental project. Cameron Kinghorn and DJ St
 epmom (Joe Christensen) didn’t even set out to start a band. When Joe te
 xted Cameron some jams whipped up on his tape machine\, Cameron hit him ba
 ck with\, “What is this? I want in.” Ten minutes before they first met
  up\, Joe built the loop for their first single\, ‘Sunshine\,’ which t
 hey then wrote on the spot in a flurry of collective inspiration. Now the 
 duo’s collection of work has grown\, amassing millions of streams\, radi
 o play\, shows across the US\, and a fan base growing rapidly.\nKing Pari 
 is much more than this serendipitous start though. The project is the culm
 ination of Joe and Cameron’s years of hard work in the Minneapolis scene
 . Their musical talents afforded them opportunities few have experienced\,
  from being invited to play shows at Prince’s Paisley Park by Prince him
 self to performing with Prince’s band New Power Generation. The two draw
  inspiration from the “no limits” nature of the Minneapolis sound\, pu
 shing it forward as they see it today.\n

 ary 23rd\, All At Once is the trio’s most expansive and imaginative work

 \, a quasi post-grunge\, post-industrial mash-up\, all wrapped up in the c
 haos and entropic funk of a warped and screwed Public Enemy demo tape and 
 a fax machine shredded in a Cuisinart. Their songs are an iridescent kind 
 of noisy digital alchemy layered in dense charging breakbeats and splatter
 ed in raucous dayglo\, laser-beamed transmissions from the future at the l
 ast protest march of the revolution. \nSymphony Spell (vocals/lyrics) and
  Zachary Fairbrother (various instruments/samplers)\, the two cyborgs that
  form Ghösh\, bonded over their love for jungle\, techno\, rap and nu met
 al to create songs that bang in tantric visions of sight and sound. Their 
 aesthetic is ripped from the screenshots of Republican nightmares and proj
 ected wide in shimmering hologram\, scored by the last dancefloor clearing
  sound blasts from a party on Cybertron\, all couched in the lyrical inten
 sity of a 2008 myspace page co-owned by Audre Lorde and Missy Elliot.\nTHE
  IREThe Ire is a post-punk group originating in Philadelphia\, started by
  guitarist Florence Lin in late 2017. Joined by Ashley Tini (drums)\, Maya
  Brooks (vocals)\, and Daniel Cox (bass)\, The Ire released their demo in
  early 2019\, and have since impressed audiences across the country with t
 heir romantic mixture of rage and passion\; packaged in the nostalgia of a
 n 80s goth and anarcho-punk sound. \n \n \n \nThe release of their debut 
 LP “What Dreams May Come” (June 6th on Play Alone Records) provides a 
 bridge from the early demos into a clear maturation of style and content\,
  as themes such as racial struggle\, societal collapse are echoed from ear
 ly recordings as well as more personal responses to the weight of our curr

 this time we decided to try something new by pairing optimistic sounding m
 usic with dark lyrics. If the listener is not a lyrics person\, they might
  not notice.”\n \nThe Ballroom Thieves’ fourth album\, Clouds\, is a 
 song cycle born of mixed experiences and fueled by the power of imaginatio
 n. The album is a lush meditation on longing to return to touring – to
  see different sunsets and cities. But\, it’s also a reflection of its d
 ifficulties\, e.g.\, insomnia brought on by sleeping in different hotel ro
 oms every night. After a major car accident and the departure of a band me

 ticipated LP for Run for Cover due on August 28. “That’s the kind of b
 and we are and to me\, that’s just how you write songs. Drums\, bass\, g
 uitar\, vocals. Nothing else. There are no other instruments on the record
 .”\nThe Houston-based band’s latest entry is the distillation of the g
 reatest moments in 90’s alternative and hard rock with a fresh set of ea
 rs\, thirteen tracks of their signature brand of bludgeoning lullabies bur
 sting at the seams with creative ideas\, new directions and yes\, massive\
 , monolithic riffs. In between the sparkle and smash\, open-hearted and em
 otionally naked songwriting showcases a core piece of the band’s identit
 y– showcasing 12th House Rock as one of the best releases of 2020. “It
 ’s the definitive work of Narrow Head\,” proudly explains bassist Ryan
  Chavez. “Recorded in a studio over a month’s span\, the way they used

  showcase both new and old material that spans their discography.\nBLEED (
 9:00 PM)\nFabricated in Dallas\, Texas with seemingly effortless self-assu
 rance BLEED’s music harkens back to a period of time when the 90s were g
 oing from mid to late and grunge and more mainstream metal were converging
  in a flurry of credibly hard-hitting\, melodic heaviness that played equa
 lly well on college and mainstream rock radio. The band’s songs hit with
  visceral heavy impact and infectious alt rock hooks\, then given further 
 shape by singer Ryan Hughes whose airy vocals glide fluidly overhead. \n 
 \nAs the band continue the work of crafting their full length LP\, to be r
 eleased by 20 Buck Spin next year\, the label will first finally issue ‘
 Somebody’s Closer’ in physical form on vinyl and tape. In the meantime
  the EP is streaming in full via all platforms and demanding repeat spins.

 e’s gonna sing. But the sun shining through the branches— are those ra
 ys yellow or hazy gray? What day is today? When are you not going to feel 
 this way again?\n“Hello\, Hi”: welcome in to a new room to play the st
 yles and feels that lie under Ty Segall’s fingers\, easing fresh air int
 o acoustic space with an assortment of love songs flowering in righteous u
 nconsciousness. Plaintive and wistful\, but unafraid. Like rain washing aw
 ay yesterday\, “Hello\, Hi” pushes open the door\, inviting the new to
  pass through all the old shades and degrees of hot and cold. Dark paths t
 urn off abruptly into absurd darkness\, then wind back through the broken 
 rocks\, ecstatic again. Absurdity again. It happens everyday.\n“Hello\, 
 Hi” is expansively rendered by Ty\, mostly by himself\, at home. The iso
 lation suits the songs: you’re only ever as “at home” as you are wit
 h yourself in the mirror. Ty’s acoustic and electric guitars and vocal h
 armonies layer self upon self\, forming a spiny backbone for the album. Te
 xtures at once gentle and dissonant root the songs as they make their move
 : melodic arcs convulsing in doubt and bliss and rage. Busting out of the 
 endless gridlock into open space\, these spirits pass on through.\n“Hell
 o\, Hi”’s flickering awakening to this trip: the opening three tracks
 ’ train of sweet and salty reflections\, before the abrupt crunch of the
  title track electrifies the senses. Good morning’s turned to good mourn
 ing in nothing flat\, but there’s still a way up from the doldrums\, to 
 try again. Why can’t it be just as simple as “Hello\, Hi”? What to d
 o with yourself when love triggers loathing? How many more times do you ha
 ve to go back there again? Pulling at the scratchy wool threads of an old 
 sweater favored for warmth\, comfort\, protection\, rejection\, denial\, b
 lindness etc\, Ty Segall dives from a clear\, open sky\, down through the 
 marine layer and the shimmering waves of all the years.\nRadiating from th
 e same mind fields as Goodbye Bread and Sleeper\, mixed with shard edges o
 f contrast and contradiction from things like Freedom’s Goblin\, Manipul
 ator\, and First Taste\, “Hello\, Hi” is Ty’s most relaxed and compl
 ete production to date\, an ebb-and flow fusion of words and music offerin
 g abstraction and acceptance as it wrestles itself through a fucked-up tim
 e. Your life and what you make of it — throughout “Hello\, Hi\,”
  Ty Segall charts a passage through its enduring tangles honestly\, with c
 larity and confusion. \n

 tively. Generally speaking their modus operandi has been to produce a viol
 ently spatially and temporally disrupted form of pop music which sometimes
  sees them gleefully break apart existing styles only to expertly reassemb
 le them and other times sees them mint entirely fresh genres. Both of them
  grew up playing and loving classical music and picked up a bug for jazz i
 n college\, but their other shared interests include Disclosure and Mica L
 evi\, with Taylor having a penchant for Bob Dylan\, and Georgia for Joni M
 itchell. They have released a clutch of singles\, EPs and a mixtape over t

 : Georgia sings a classic pre-rock & roll orchestral lounge pop song while
  Taylor forces it through a post-dubstep blender\, mixing old with new.\nB

 kstrap are the only young artists in the UK (both are 24) who currently ha

 PM – Show\nAOIFFE NESSA FRANCES\nIn spring of 2020\, Aoife Nessa Frances
  moved out of the city for the first time in her life. After packing up he
 r things in Dublin\, she moved to rural County Clare on the west coast of 
 Ireland\, and there\, amidst the stillness\, she worked on the songs that 
 would become her second album\, Protector. The resulting body of work deft
 ly juxtaposes golden hours and arguments\, affection and alienation\, and 
 above all marks a crucial period of her life that was transformative and l
 eft her wiser.\n \n“I might have been running away from my problems\,”
  she admits. “I was disconnected from myself and from nature\, but I fou
 nd peace far away from the city\, where there were no distractions. I isol
 ated myself with nothing to do but make music.” Writing Protector provid
 ed Frances an essential sounding board for this journey. “I felt a growi
 ng inner strength that guided me through the making of this album. It was 
 like sculpting with my eyes closed\, this intense sense of self-preservati
 on leading me and growing with each song I wrote. When I started\, I didn
 ’t recognise myself. With each song\, I became more human.”\n \nAoife 
 spent that summer with her dad and two sisters. “It was a very special t
 ime for my family as we had never been that tight knit before\,” she say
 s\, “and we all became very close…driving the country roads and swimmi
 ng in the Atlantic Ocean and lakes of Clare. I had one CD in my car: Jim S
 ullivan’s UFO and we listened to it over and over again.” Like many pe
 ople in their late twenties shaking off youthful rebelliousness\, Frances 
 experienced a solidification of familial ties like never before\, and felt
  the formation of a protective\, impenetrable shell. “For me\, Protector
  acknowledges the part of myself that steers me towards a brighter path. T
 he almost psychotropic power of nature gave me a connection I never felt b
 efore. As the countryside seeped into me and lines of communication opened
  up with my family\, I developed an ability to perceive myself and my choi
 ces within an expanded world.”\nINDIGO SPARKE\n \n“To be at the edge\,
  at the precipice of anything\, requires deep surrender. It’s like dying
  over and over again. In the tidal throes of life at its fullest and most 
 intense is the space where grace and strength is fortified and cultivated\
 , is what I am learning” Indigo Sparke ruminates on her magnetic second 
 full-length album Hysteria\, a huge and beautiful sweeping work\, one that
  possesses a rare\, reflective power. From the first few notes\, in the fi
 rst song\, Blue\, something chilling and captivating pierces straight into
  the listener’s chest. With harmonies reminiscent of the voices in our h
 eads\, she examines love\, loss\, grief\, a newly realized rage\, her hist
 ory\, dreams\, and the emotional weather patterns surrounding those sensat
 ions: her words tell the stories\, and the sounds act them out. It’s a d
 iary built for big stages. ‘Hysteria’ arrives just a year after her st
 riking\, minimalist debut\, Echo. Here though\, Sparke offers an expansive
  body of work—it’s a simultaneously nostalgic yet clear and complex co
 llection that expands her sound and outlook. \n
