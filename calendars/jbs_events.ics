 oors8 PM – Show\nTHIS IS LORELEI\nTransformation is a funny thing. In se
 eking self-improvement\, we parse through our inner angels and demons\, de
 signating our better tendencies as core parts of our identity and dismissi
 ng problem areas as reflections of past selves we’re bound to outgrow 
 — as if both sides aren’t integral parts of us. Personal growth can be
  a tricky and disingenuous prospect — often further muddied by capitalis
 m\, armchair psychologists and religious zealots — but it’s also an es
 sential\, life-affirming process worth enduring. Box for Buddy\, Box for S
 tar\, the latest album from This Is Lorelei\, explores this conundrum\, fu
 nctioning both as an earnest transformative exercise and a tongue-in-cheek
  takedown of the illusion of transformation.Since 2012\, New York City sin
 ger-songwriter Nate Amos (Water From Your Eyes\, My Idea) has recorded and
  self-released hundreds of songs under the This Is Lorelei moniker\, and p
 erhaps surprisingly\, after a decade plus\, Box for Buddy\, Box for Star m
 arks the first attempt at a traditional\, intentionally written full-lengt
 h album. Amos describes the bulk of This Is Lorelei’s discography as “
 unedited diary entries\,” written and recorded without much forethought\
 , regard for genre or reverence for albums as thematic bodies of work\, so
  oddly enough\, Box for Buddy\, Box for Star is both a fresh start and the
  culmination of years of diligent\, interesting songwriting.\nYOUBET\n22°
  HALO\n22º halo is a recording project/band from Philadelphia. \nThey rec
 ently released a new album Lily of the Valley on Tiny Library Records.\n
 Will on Lily of the Valley: “Lily of the valley is about my life with 
 Kate’s cancer. Started out as an album for her and ended up as an album 
 for me. It’s about our love as a buoy during the time of Kate’s cancer
  diagnosis + treatment. It’s helped me feel less alone in being a careta
 ker. It’s helped me hold onto hope when Kate gets MRI scans every two mo
 nths to see if her cancer has come back.\nIt’s so hard to see someone’
 s body deteriorate in front of you and know you can’t do anything to sto
 p it. It’s infuriating to hold your wife as she mourns the loss of her o
 ld life\, and you can’t bring it back. Her cancer feels endlessly seriou
 s to me\, and yet when I’m around other people\, I can’t stop making j
 okes. – I’m hoping this album can hold some levity without losing this
  seriousness. I know me and Kate could talk about her cancer forever\, but
  I fear that I’m coming across as long winded\, or harping too much on t
 he topic. I just want people to see Kate over and over again\, because she
 ’s been through fucking hell\, and now with a hat on\, her scar isn’t 
 even visible.\nLily of the valley is about the little things I notice and 
 love about Kate\, and letting that fill my mornings. What’s holier than 
 holding onto someone you love?”\n

 sound? It depends on when you ask.The 24-year-old\, Maryland-raised songwr
 iter arrived on the music scene with 2020’s Classical Notions of Happine
 ss\, an album of lo-fi pop and hushed folk songs recorded in her Maryland 
 & Kansas bedrooms. She’d be back by the end of that same year with Somet
 hing To Say To You\, a compilation of two EPs featuring craggy indie rock 
 and brokenhearted acoustic fare recorded in NYC apartment studios with fri
 ends.By 2022 she was swinging for the fences with the pristine pop of Face
  The Wall\, all while shuttling back and forth between Brooklyn and her so
 on-to-be home of Eagle Rock\, LA collaborating on a wide array of projects
  with a who’s who of Gen Z artists: Magdalena Bay\, TV Girl\, Yot Club\,
  Paul Cherry\, Dent May\, Inner Wave.“I don’t think I’ll ever settle
  on a specific sound\,” says Jordana. “I’m just a chameleon.”So he
 r vibrant fourth LP\, Lively Premonition\, which is equal parts Laurel Can
 yon folk and shimmering yacht rock\, should surprise no one.“Maybe it’
 s my LA record\,” she says of the album she worked on with producer and 
 multi-instrumentalist Emmett Kai for the entirety of 2023. “I can’t pi
 npoint exactly what affected it\, but I do think the sun has its beam on m
 e. Through all of these releases\, it’s so cool to see which eras I’ve
  gone through and what I’ve experimented with\,” says Jordana.Though t
 he concept of eras is exhaustingly omnipresent at the moment\, Jordana has
  earned the right to draw the definitive lines between her releases and mu
 sical phases. Her current iteration owes a debt to a deep love for artists
  like The Mamas & The Papas\, Carole King\, Donald Fagen & Walter Becker 
 – all New Yorkers who\, like Jordana\, moved out west and found their so
 unds flourishing.\nRACHEL BOBBITT\nLife runs in rhythmic loops\, from the 
 endless rotations of the earth to the running of tides and yearly rebirth 
 of spring. Rachel Bobbitt knows that the bottom of those cycles can feel p
 retty chaotic. “Every woman I’ve ever talked to is in some amount of p
 ain almost all the time\,” the Toronto-based singer-songwriter says. “
 That could be physical pain\, emotional pain\, familial pain\, but it’s 
 there in cycles.” On her piercing and profound new EP\, The Ceiling Coul
 d Collapse (due July 15th\, 2022\, via Fantasy Records)\, Bobbitt picks th
 rough the dizzying rubble of folk and indie rock for moments of resonant e
 motion and frames them in heartbreaking lyrics and openhearted expanses.\n

 the close-knit group of Al Menne\, Dylan Hanwright\, Cam LaFlam\, and Pat 
 and Carrie Goodwin – didn’t know if they would go on. After starting o
 n the follow-up to Four of Arrows\, each member was called in different di
 rections\, some to new countries\, new jobs\, new life stages. But as Menn
 e puts it simply\, “Time passed and I missed my friends.” As any good 
 relationship built on mutual love\, trust\, and a mountain of shared histo
 ry\, the quintet—who grew up in Seattle and have been making music toget
 her for a decade—were drawn back into one another’s orbits in 2023.  
 Great Grandpa recently made their highly-anticipated and “epic return”
  (Brooklyn Vegan) with the gorgeous track “Kid\,” and “Doom” is an
 other cathartic entry in the band’s beloved catalog. Penned by Pat Goodw
 in soon after the release of 2019’s acclaimed Four of Arrows\, the song 
 swirled in the band’s consciousness\, taking on many iterations before b
 eing officially recorded in 2024. “Doom\,” produced by guitarist/engin
 eer Dylan Hanwright and Goodwin\, is the bands’ first self-produced trac
 k since 2017’s Plastic Cough. It sees the band at the furthest end of th
 eir prog/math-rock spectrum — at times embracing the odd time signatures
  and heavy electric guitar of their early years while expanding on the dar
 k\, knotty chamber-folk of Four of Arrows. And now\, with these two new tr
 acks and a run of tour dates on their belt\, Great Grandpa continues. Thes

 in the heart of the Hudson Valley\, through 13 albums (among them Emblems\
 , Several Arrows Later\, The Dark Leaves\, The State of Gold\, and\, most 
 recently\, the luminous The Natural Lines)\, Matt Pond PA has always been 
 a living\, breathing organism—one that’s constantly changing. One nota
 ble mainstay: Pond’s longtime right-hand man\, Chris Hansen. “I named

 y on Orange Milk Records\, his acclaimed fifth full length and first viny

  of challenging electronic music. Purity is a response to finding a neig
 hbor’s dead body. While processing this trauma and his own relationship 
 with suicidal ideation\, Morgan Garrett created an album of dissonance and
  fragile voice\, oscillating between dense electric guitars and anxiety ri
 dden whispers. This mesh of avant-garde electronics\, rock instrumentation
  and hi-fidelity production is a new assertion in underground music.\n \n
 SOUR SPIRIT\nSour Spirit are two brothas who are brothers making waves of 
 harsh noise with free jazz flourishes\, playing within and in spite of tra

 gha is a multidisciplinary experimental artist born and raised in Philadel

 sonances that are the extended bodies of the modified objects they fabrica
 te. Kat Nzingha uses convulsing kicks\, metallic percussion\, and hyper-pr
 ocessed textures to design sound\, and distinct repetitive techniques\, in

 exico where the two year writing process for Safe to Run unfolded. Making 
 the transition to this new environment after spending the better part of a
  decade building a life somewhere else demanded looking around and taking

 that is necessary to know in order to appreciate the songs\,” says Matth
 ew Davidson of Twain. He describes the project as “a modern folk-opera o
 f indefinite length consisting of songs and images from my life\, a self-c
 aricature of the musician and writer Matthew Davidson.”Twain made his la
 bel debut with Rare Feeling in 2017. The album was aptly hailed by NPR as 
 “at once human and otherworldly\,” by Consequence of Sound as “devas
 tating\, delicate\, meditative\,” and by Uproxx as “cosmic folk\, brig
 ht and sparkling\, but with all the caterwauling and rough bits that the m
 ost stoic traditionalist might desire.” Following the beloved release\,
  Twain played Newport Folk Festival and toured alongside artists including
  Buck Meek\, Langhorne Slim\, and Courtney Marie Andrews. Davidson is a fo
 rmer member of The Low Anthem and Spirit Family Reunion and a contributor 
 to Big Thief\, whose latest album Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in Yo
 u features Davidson’s distinct contributions on six songs. \n

 from one of those mystical moments in time\, which spawned a lasting creat

 t while playing in a touring band for another Norwegian artist. During tha
 t time\, they bonded over their love for instrumental music and began talk
 ing about trying their hand at it themselves. After their work as touring 
 band ended\, they recruited drummer Kim Åge Furuhaug\, one of Holm’s lo
 ngtime friend and collaborators\, to join their new project.The three met 
 in Bergen\, located along the west coast of Norway\, to start working on i
 deas and demos. Instead\, within just a few days\, they ended up recording
  their entire first album\, Mint. From there\, the universe propelled them
  forward\, resulting in a record deal\, their live debut as a band at Norw
 ay’s biggest pop festival Øyafestivalen and the release of their debut 
 record all happening within the following year. Mint drew international in
 terest and praise from outlets including Atwood Magazine\, who called the 
 record “an eclectic fusion of disparate styles and exciting sounds that 
 says what it wants to say through memorable melodies\, ambient drones\, an

 ey’ve honed and refined their stark\, minimal scrape and clatter for fou
 r years and counting\, having risen out of the ashes of beloved Chicago ba
 nd Disappears in 2018 with the bone-rattling intensity of Negative Houses.
  The trio return in 2021 with Present Tense\, their fourth album and perha
 ps their sharpest statement as a band. Opener “XOUT” barrels forward 
 like a tank\, with Case’s guitar chiming like warning bells\, until the 
 climax comes crashing down\, glitching out near the close. “Strawberry C
 ough” comes next\, its fusion of corporeal playing and stately\, electro
 nic heartbeats punctured by random bursts of noise or backwards masked sou
 nds. “Alone Without”\, a track originally recorded for Adult Swim’s 
 2020 singles series appears next in different form\; more menacing and ser
 pentine. Side two opens with “General Public”\, taking the loud/quiet 
 dynamic as a jumping off point for the song’s unsettling seasick vibe. 
 ‘How To See In the Dark” offers a brief respite\, with its persistent\
 , dark quietude that lingers until the song’s end. “Present Tense”\,
  the album’s title track\, offers up its first truly weird moment mid-so
 ng when the song changes mood distinctly\, and the music drops out save fo
 r Case’s guitar and vocals. The album’s final track\, the densely pack
 ed “Mirrored”\, begins with a restrained\, post-rock shuffle. The mind
 -scrambling cacophony that comes next takes its time to roll in\, but once
  it does\, it comes in waves\, flipping back onto itself multiple times un
 til it’s folded into oblivion. FACS once again shuttered themselves int
 o Electrical Audio with lauded engineer Sanford Parker to lay down the bas
 ic tracks and overdubs for Present Tense. This time\, the band approached 
 their songwriting from a different angle “Alone Without was the first so
 ng we recorded and we really built it in the studio” Case says\, “Alia
 nna and I played different instruments\, and I think that freedom informed
  how the other songs developed. All the lyrics were random phrases on a bi
 g sheet and were put together as the songs took shape\, so I feel like I w
 as collecting these thoughts and trying to figure out how to process them 
 as a big picture vs making complete ideas in individual songs.” Case add
 s ”…letting the songs go where they wanted\, without steering them int
 o what we all think a FACS album should be.” The change is palpable from
  last year’s claustrophobic and fried Void Moments\, but Present Tense i
 s still ALL FACS\, albeit draped in a layer of haze. Paranoia in soft focu
 s\, perhaps?\n

 ors9PM – Show\n \nNAKED GIANTS\nWhen Naked Giants formed in 2014\, the 
 Seattle trio—vocalist/guitarist Grant Mullen\, bassist/vocalist Gianni A
 iello and drummer Henry LaVallee—were all eighteen years old\, and full 
 of the reckless\, restless energy of youth. A decade on\, both they and th
 e world have changed immensely. Shine Away—the band’s third full-lengt
 h\, following on from 2018’s SLUFF and 2020’s The Shadow—is very muc
 h an acknowledgement of that. It’s an album that doesn’t just reflect 
 on the personal life and times of the three of them and the world at large
 \, but casts a discerning\, self-reflective eye on what it’s like to be 
 in\, and be\, Naked Giants. It’s the sound of a band coming into\, and b
 ecoming\, themselves. Of course\, that’s a never-ending process\, but fo
 r the first time in their career\, Naked Giants are taking stock of their 
 journey—who and what they were\, are\, and want to be.  \n“Our first 
 record was still running on fuel from starting the band as 18 year olds wi
 th a rock’n’roll dream\,” says Mullen. “Since then\, life has chan
 ged. We all got day jobs or went back to school\, and really grew into our
 selves individually.  Before\, we were anxious to express ourselves in wh
 atever way we could through music. Now\, we have more to say\, and I think
  we’ve made a record with more meaning and purpose.”\nDespite these pe
 rsonal changes Shine Away contains the same sense of impetuous urgency tha
 t defined SLUFF. and the band’s preceding 2016 debut EP\, R.I.P.\, and w
 as still to be found within the fabric of The Shadow’s songs\, too. So w
 hile the band might be removed from their younger selves\, there are still
  traces of those people in these nine songs.\n \nGIRL AND GIRL\nSub Pop
 ’s latest signing is Girl and Girl: lead singer/songwriter Kai James and
  his Aunty Liss (Melissa James) on drums\, supported by Jayden Williams on
  guitar and Fraser Bell on bass. The four-piece garage rock outfit from Qu

 ctric live shows – Kai’s magnetism backed by Liss’ 37 years of drumm
 ing experience. With infectious hooks and surprising emotional intensity\,
  Girl and Girl is an undeniably good time.\nNamed as one of the TheMusic.
 com.au‘s ‘Top 25 Rising Acts of 2021’\, Girl and Girl won the inaugu

 ca\, with a staggering 29 albums under his belt. Known affectionately as t
 he “Simigwa Do Man\,” Ambolley’s musical journey began in the vibran
 t port city of Sekondi-Takoradi\, in the Western Region of Ghana. His earl
 y fascination with music blossomed into a lifelong passion. From mastering
  his father’s flute at the tender age of eight\, to honing his guitar sk
 ills under the mentorship of “Uncle Bonku”\, Sammy Lartey and Ebo Tayl
 or\, Ambolley’s musical odyssey has been nothing short of extraordinary.
  This all led to Ambolley becoming a musical life force and exploding on t
 he scene in 1973 with a jazzy highlife sound called ‘SIMIGWA-DO’. His 
 name has become synonymous with Simigwa music and dance.Coming of age amid
 st the zenith of Ghana’s highlife era\, Ambolley emerged as a pivotal fi
 gure in its evolution\, lending his talents to esteemed bands such as Houg
 has Extraordinaires\, Meridians Of Tema and Ghana Broadcasting Band. It wa
 s during this time that he caught the attention of his compatriot and frie
 nd\, Ebo Taylor\, who recruited Ambolley to be a member of the Uhuru Dance
  Band. This all lead to a transformative journey to Nigeria in 1973\, wher
 e they shared the stage with the legendary Fela Kuti at his renowned Shrin
 e venue.1975 Debut Album Simigwa: Gyedu Blay Ambolley’s groundbreaking d
