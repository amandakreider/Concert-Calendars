 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nWORRIERS\n \nLauren Denitzio has 
 always been the type of songwriter to say exactly what’s on their mind. 
 Over the course of the past decade with their band Worriers\, they’ve ad
 dressed gender liberation\, capitalist violence\, and searing heartbreak\,
  allover the band’s signature style of triumphant chords and subtle pop 
 sensibilities. Worriers was always a band that shined with the feelings of
  ecstatic potential\; offering a sense of liberation amidst the chaos of t
 he world. And yet\, on their newest album Warm Blanket\, they’ve never s
 ounded more free.The band’s fourth full length record has the feel of an
  exciting debut and there’s a reason: it marks the first time that Denit
 zio accepted that the group they had been trying to treat as a band is act
 ually a solo project. After a pace of touring and recording that would be 
 breakneck for most\, but derigueur in the underground scene which forged t
 hem\, Denitzio found themselves in the summer of 2022 with a chance to fin
 ally catch their breath. “I realized I could write whatever I wanted.”
 The DIY ethic that Denitzio developed on a thousand punk tours\, playing s
 quats\, house parties and rowdy warehouses is never far from their mode of
  operation. And so—with no proper training in audio recording—they rec
 orded and mixed the entirety of Warm Blanket at home. Atom Willard (Agains
 t Me!\, Social Distortion) contributed drums remotely\, adding an orchestr
 al element of weight and emphasis to the proceedings.The result is a colle
 ction of songs that reflects Denitizio “unlearning the expectations of b
 eing in a band” and writing music “that’s more in line with my actua
 l influences.” Written during a particularly fertile creative period—D
 enitzio had already completed an entirely separate new album to be release
 d later—Warm Blanket marked a chance to write the kind of songs they had
  always appreciated but were unsure of how to place in the Worriers catalo
 g.\n \n \n \nLIZDELISE \n \nPhiladelphia band Lizdelise has garnered loc
 al acclaim since their inception in 2014. LDL released their newest track 
 “WMN” June 7th in anticipation of their first North American tour– a
  queer ballad\, full of fear and joy\, and the feeling of running to catch
 -up with yourself. The experimental pop band recorded “WMN” at Betty
 ’s in Chapel Hill\, NC\, with Andy Stack (Wye Oak\, Joyero\, Helado Negr
 o). For fans of…dynamic\, genre-bending range like NNAMDI\, shredding gu
 itar and dreamy vocals like St. Vincent\, darkness and strength like Sharo
 n Van Etten.\nBEST BEARBest Bear is all about understated indie-rock\, eth
 ereal dream-pop textures\, and heartfelt lyrics. At times lush and oneiric
 \, at others raw and unapologetic\, the band’s songs feel like a genuine
  portrait of the member’s life-long love of music. However\, there is al
 so an inclusive\, community-driven element at play. Connecting with the au
 dience and other artists drives the mindset of the band\, which proudly id
 entifies with the LGBTQIA+ community and values. Fans of artists such as P
 hoebe Bridgers\, The Beths\, Soccer Mommy\, or Pinegrove should definitely
  tune in!\n \n \n \n \n

 name is Ron Gallo\, I live on the line between two mindsets:\n1. The world
  is completely fucked2. The universe is inside you\nThis is my artist bio.
  Who has time to read this in 2022? With all that’s happening? With thes
 e attention spans? I know I am not cool or important — no one is — I t
 hink it’s a good thing. Listen to the music\, come to a show\, think for
  yourself. The best compliment I ever received was when someone told me th
 ey can never tell when I am serious. My two biggest fears are opposites 
 — having a child or killing someone. You’re probably a little confused
  or annoyed\, but at least you’re not asleep. That’s kind of my thing.
  I bet you made it this far. Success!!!\nWe have all been through a lot. E
 specially the last few years but also all the years before that. There was
  never time to collectively stop and question what has been considered “
 normal” for so long and it turns out nothing really is. These ways of th
 inking and doing in America were never serving everyone but now they’re 
 not serving anyone (except maybe 5 guys that all look identical and own ev
 erything). So\, I spent an entire record trying to understand what is happ
 ening\, what’s wrong with this place and what’s wrong with myself\, it
 ’s called “FOREGROUND MUSIC” and it’s going to come out on legenda

 7PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nTWEN\n \nOn July 22\, DIYers twe
 n self-released their 2nd LP ‘One Stop Shop’\; a collection of 10 song
 s that finds the band writing\, producing\, mixing\, directing\, designing
 \, booking and managing their own project. In an age of mediocre songs wit
 h pristine studio-production\, One Stop Shop provides an antidote with 10 
 hook-laden compositions\, chock-full of purposeful\, inspired rock songs a
 bout modern life in 2022. Half-written tunes\, downloaded beats\, multi-pr
 oducer records\, stylists and PR teams should run for the hills.\n \nThrou
 ghout the pandemic\, Jane Fitzsimmons & Ian Jones self-converted their Dod
 ge Promaster Tour-Van into a full-time\, doomsday mobile-home\; complete w
 ith solar power\, carpentry\, plumbing\, propane\, and refrigeration\, all
  with their own four hands. Living in it full-time since February of 2021\
 , 20 songs were written\; 15 recorded\, and 10 chosen for their post-pande
 mic proclamation. The songs are beautifully evocative\, political without 
 being patronizing or pandering\, and widespread in their diversity of soun
 ds & emotions. Title track “One Stop Shop (For A Fading Revolution)” i
 s a propulsive overture for the end times\, while “HaHaHome”\, the alb
 um’s lead single- is an ode to brit-pop with a Stone-roses-esque basslin
 e that could even make Paul McCartney jealous. “Brooklyn Bridge” showc
 ases the duo’s ability to craft metaphorically complex lyrics that are s
 imultaneously immediate because of the heartfelt prosody of Fitzsimmons’
  vocals- vocals that until now\, would’ve seemed out of twen’s former 
 wheelhouse as “indie-psych-rockers”. On “Feeling In Love (From the W
 aist Down)” and “Sweet Dreams (In the Parking Lot)” they make good o
 n their promise to ‘never write the same song twice’. Important\; cons
 idering how many bands in the cultural sphere get by as one-trick ponies.\
 n \nIn addition\, twen have solidified a 5 piece line-up\, consisting of M
 erideth Hanscom on bass guitar\, Asher Horton on guitar\, and Luke Fedorko
  on drums. To show it all off\, the band will be headlining 2 NYC shows at
  TV EYE & Mercury Lounge\, before embarking on their biggest break yeta 24
  city North American Tour supporting Rainbow Kitten Surprise. (All of this
  without an agent\, management\, or PR team)\n \nWhen you take it all in\,
  twen are proving to be among the most original\, hardworking and authenti
 c American rock bands today. Not because they are tiktok viral\, or posing
  in decades-cosplay and attempting to draw you in by preying on your rock-
 n-roll nostalgia\, but because they are writing great songs\, traveling th
 e country in a van they built themselves\, self-producing their own art\, 
 screenprinting their own merch\, and doing it their way\, all against the 
 backdrop of the apocalypse. That image can’t be crafted by a team\, and 
 just as has always been the case\, that freedom is what rock n’ roll rea
 lly feels like.\nLISALisa is a 4-piece Philly rock band whose sound is inf

 e Show\n \nEvoking a rich tapestry of ice-caked forests\, peasant revolts\
 , and silent knights\, POISON RUIN stab at the pulsing heart of what it me
 ans to live under the permanent midnight of contemporary life. With Harves
 t\, the band aligns their sonic palette to their godless\, medieval-inflec
 ted aesthetic symbolism\, creating a record which strikes with an assured 
 sense of blackened harmony.\n“I’ve always found fantasy tropes to be i
 ncredibly evocative\,” vocalist Mac Kennedy notes\, “that said\, even 
 though they are a set of symbols that seem to speak to most people of our 
 generation\, they are often either apolitical or co-opted for incredibly b
 ackwards politics.”\nKennedy reworks fantasy imagery as a series of tote
 ms for the downtrodden\, stripping it of its escapist tendencies and retoo
 ling it as a rich metaphor for the collective struggle over our shared rea
 lity: “Instead of knights in shining armor and dragons\, it’s a peasan
 t revolt\,” Kennedy explains\, “I’m all for protest songs\, but with
  this band I’ve found that sometimes your message can reach a greater au
 dience if you imbue it with a certain interactive\, almost magical realist
  element.”\nThe title track invokes images of feudal peasants\, tithes\
 , and money-hungry lords\, sounding the horn of labor with the rallying cr
 y\, “Isn’t this our harvest? Isn’t this our feast to share?” Tales
  of the undead rising to take revenge upon those who have unknowingly wron
 ged them spin out like pleasantly cathartic folktales (“Resurrection II
 ”)\, while other tracks address the profound beauty and spirit of those 
 making ends meet in the forsaken ends of POISON RUIN’s hometown of Phila
 delphia (“Blighted Quarter”). The band stares into the abyss of modern
  living with a sober and empathetic outlook\, portraying our cracked reali
 ty as a complex and difficult to parse miasma of competing desires.\nWith 
 Harvest\, POISON RUIN have constructed a richly chilling fable out of mode
 rn living. Their tale is as lurid as it is seductive\, as much a promising
  fantasy as it is a dreary portrait of reality itself. \n \n \n \nPUFFER

 ce here. We are a group of five boys from Miami\, Florida just looking for
  a good time. Now if you’d like to take the time\, we’d like to tell y
 ou how this shit-show began. On a warm summer evening in the year of our L
 ord 2015\, a young college drop out is in his backyard\, guitar in hands s
 cribbling lazily on a loose sheet of paper. He taps his pen on his chin in
 tensely\, contemplating the first and only line that reads: “I’m going
  down”. he stares down at his pathetic excuse for an opening line and ca
 lls it a night. “eh\, I’ll try again tomorrow” he says. This is his 
 mantra. He didn’t know it then\, but that pathetic little line would be 
 the birthplace of a little band called Mustard Service and that pathetic l
 ittle line would be the opening line of a little album called Zest Pop. 
 For the next two years Marco Rivero and Armando Baeza (producer and forme
 r drummer) wrote and recorded the debut album “Zest Pop”\, bringing in
  their friends Gabriel Marinuchi (guitar)\, Augusti Di Catarina (bass\, ba
 cking vocals)\, and Leo Cattani (keys) to play the songs live as a full ba
 nd. they played a few push-moshing\, beer-spilling\, gear-breaking\, cop-c
 alling\, arrested-getting shows throughout Miami-Dade County\, managing to
  amass a small yet passionate fanbase in their home town. In those years\
 , GarageBand™  transitioned into ProTools™\, recordings evolved into
  mastered tracks\, and  small house shows turned into packed venues. Th
 eir Debut album was released in June of 2017\, relying solely on live sho
 ws and streaming platform algorithms for promotion and exposure. The algo
 rithm gods took pity on these poor fools and granted them a world-wide aud
 ience over the span of the next three years\, leading into the release of 
 their sophomore album titled “Ces’t La Vie” in March of 2020.`\nRYA

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nFAKE NAMES\n \nIf credibility wer
 e currency\, Fake Names’ wealth would be off the charts. Composed ofBria
 n Baker (Minor Threat\, Bad Religion\, Dag Nasty)\, Michael Hampton (S.O.A
 .\,Embrace)\, Dennis Lyxzén (Refused\, INVSN\, The [International] Noise 
 Conspiracy)\,Johnny Temple (Girls Against Boys\, Soulside) and the newest 
 member Brendan Canty(Fugazi\, Rites of Spring)\, the band is a veritable p
 ost-hardcore dream team. Howeverinstead of rehashing the past\,Expendables
 is a reinvention that sees the band dialingback the distortion and leaning
  into the melodies. The result pairs their unparalleledpedigree with a pop
  sensibility that’s slightly unexpected and wholly satisfying. “On our
 last record [2019’sFake Names] the general influences were 70’s U.K. p
 unk and power-pop\; butit wound up with a little classic rock vibe as well
 \, like the Vibrators meetsAerosmith. We never saw that coming!” Baker e
 xplains. “The pop influences are a littlemore out front on this one and 
 the production really helps it shine. It sounds more direct\,more urgent.
 ”While the band’s debut album was actually a demo that Epitaph founder
  and Baker’s BadReligion bandmate Brett Gurewitz wanted to release as is
 \, forExpendablesthe bandenlisted producer Adam “Atom” Greenspan (IDLE
 S\, Yeah Yeah Yeahs). “On the newrecord the guitar tones are pretty clea
 n\, which is not what we normally do\, but we’re oldenough to know to gi
 ve Atom’s ideas a shot because that’s the whole point of bringingsomeo
 ne in\,” Baker explains. “Atom had me play through amps and pedals way
  out ofmy comfort zone\, but the sounds he built were perfect for the song
 s.” That sense ofcuriosity is a major thematic component ofExpendables\,
 from the chiming harmonies of“Go” to the moody melodicism of “Madtow
 n” (the latter of which could have just as easilybeen written in 1982 as
  it could in 2022). There’s also an economy to these songs that’sroote
 d in the fact that they were recorded in the span of a week\, which elimin
 ated theoption to add superfluous instrumentation or arrangements. The res
 ult is an album thatretains the members’ purity of vision in a strikingl
 y refreshing way.\n

  solitude transform into the islands that sit blue along the horizon. The 
 Salish Sea curves along her homelands\, and when the singer is close to th
 is water she is reminded of her grandmother\, how she looked out at these 
 same islands\, and she’s held by spirit and memory.\n \nThe Land\, The W
 ater\, The Sky rises and falls\, in darkness and in light\, but even in it
 s most melancholy moments it is never despairing. That is the beauty of re
 turning home. When you stand on ancestral lands it is impossible to be alo
 ne. You feel the arms and hands that hold you up\, unwilling to let you fa
 ll into sorrow or abandonment. In her songs Katherine Paul has channeled t
 hat feeling of being held. In every note she has written a love letter to 
 indigenous strength and healing.\n \nThere is a joy present here\, a fierc
 e blissfulness that comes with walking the trails along the river\, feelin
 g the sand and the stones beneath her feet. It is the pride and the certai
 nty that comes with knowing her ancestors walked along the same land\, dip
 ped their hands into the water\, and ran their fingertips along the same b
 ark of cedar trees.\n \nThis is a story of hope\, as it details the joy of
  returning. Katherine Paul’s journey home wasn’t made alone\, and the 
 songs are crowded with loved ones and relatives\, like a really good party
 . And as the songs walk us through the land it is important we hover over 
 the images and the beauty\, the moments that mark this album as site speci
 fic. The power of this land is woven throughout\, telling the story of nar
 row waterways\, brush strokes\, salmon stinta\, and above all healing.\nCL

 ting within such tension and surviving beyond the breaking point.\n

  to capture it. The group is driven by Langan and Frost’s finger-plucked
  melodies on guitar but branches out to instruments of the Middle and Far 
 East\, India\, the Mediterranean\, and Appalachia. It is the belief of the

 specially if his name is William Elliott Whitmore.  With his powerful vo
 ice and honest approach\, Whitmore comes from the land\, growing up on a 
 family farm in Lee County\, Iowa.  Still living on the same farm today\,
  Whitmore has truly taken the time to discover where his center lies\, and
  from that he will not be moved.\n \nWhitmore has repeatedly carved his ow
 n path\, honoring the longstanding tradition of folk music throughout his 
 nearly 20 year career\, while always allowing his blues\, soul and punk ro
 ck influences to shine through.  Getting his first break opening for his 
 friend’s hardcore band with just a banjo in hand\, he would discover ban
 ds like The Jesus Lizard\, Bad Brains\, Lungfish and Minutemen and soon le
 arn to play his own brand of rural\, roots music with that same DIY ethic.
 \n \nWilliam Elliott Whitmore has been back and forth across the United St
 ates and to cities around the world.  He’s toured with such diverse act
 s as Frank Turner\, Trampled By Turtles\, Clutch and Chris Cornell to name
  a few.  He’s appeared on some of the biggest stages around the world i
 ncluding Stagecoach Fest\, Byron Bluesfest (Australia) and End of the Road
  Fest (UK).  His willingness to take his show to any playing field has pr
 oved invaluable as he turned strangers to diehards with every performance.

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nLONG BEARDMeans To Me is the sec
 ond full-length under Leslie Bear’s moniker\, Long Beard\, and her first
  since 2015’s Sleepwalker. Throughout the record\, Leslie explores what
  constitutes a home — how it extends beyond the physicality of a roof ov
 er your head to the comfort of another person. A sense of self\, stability
  or security.The last four years between records mark a particularly signi
 ficant and transitional time for Bear. A career move led her back to her h
 ometown in New Jersey long after her friends and peers moved away\, result
 ing in feelings of stasis and nostalgia that shape the album. Reflections 
 on the past are evident in tracks like album single “Sweetheart”\, in 
 which Bear considers a past love\, where they are now\, and her life in re
 lation to theirs.Bear’s sophomore album shows a growth and maturation in
  sound from her debut. Co-produced with Craig Hendrix (Japanese Breakfast)
 \, the record occupies a dreamlike space that weaves between shoegaze-ting
 ed guitars and upbeat\, jangly pop. While still loyal to Leslie’s signat
 ure ethereal\, melodic guitars and haunting whispered vocal delivery\, the
  fully realized arrangements demonstrate a stunning clarity throughout the
  album.\n \nThe perfect amalgamation between Bear’s ambient-textured loo
 ps met with the pristine production and pop stylings of Hendrix’s playin
 g can be heard in album standout “Snow Globe.” The combined reversal e
 ffects\, seamless transitions\, and heartbeat percussion are the language 
 of Means To Me.What Bear has created with Means To Me is not only a mirr
 or for herself\, but also a means for the listener to reflect on what home
  means to them. Whether Bear has defined a home for herself is left to won
 der\, as she leaves us with these final lines before the album crescendos 
 into an explosive distorted instrumental and slowly fades: “driving down
  through our state lines while you dream\, I’m thinking of a name to go 
 by.”\nYOWLERYowler is the Philadelphia-based solo project of Maryn Jones
 \, who has been recording and releasing music online and in burned cd\, ta
 pe and record form since as early as 2004. What started out in 2013 as a c
 onceptual project where dark thoughts and too-quiet moments could be place
 d\, Yowler has become a main outlet for Jones’ songwriting. After most r
 ecently being a part of the loud pop outfit All Dogs as songwriter\, and l
 ong-time member and multi-instrumentalist in the psych-folk group Saintsen
 eca\, Jones has been focusing her musical time and energy on writing for Y
 owler\, and collaborating with Philadelphia-based producer and engineer Ky
 le Gilbride to create the forthcoming Black Dog in My Path. Black Dog in 
 My Path is Yowler’s second album after 2014’s release The Offer\, and 
 was recorded in the many months after Jones’ move from Columbus\, Ohio t
 o Philadelphia. Created with Gilbride of Swearin’ and Missing Earth\, th
 e record is a kind of sonic quilt\, pieced together from various musical i
 nspirations and drawn from a period of great personal change. \n

  – Show\nCHARLY BLISS\n \n“I don’t know why it’s easiest for me to
  frame the darkest lyrics in the context of upbeat songs\,” says Charly 
 Bliss’ Eva Hendricks. “It’s completely instinctual and not something
  I ever plan out. It sort of mirrors how I am\, and maybe it’s a way of 
 protecting myself. In my opinion\, the two best emotional releases are cry
 ing and dancing\, so it makes sense to me to marry the two.” That combin
 ation is the core of Charly Bliss who\, on this record\, embraced both sid
 es of that equation more than ever before. Challenging each other to be ex
 posed\, to be seen for who they really are as people\, and then to double 
 down on the sound that emerged from that process is the story of the band
 ’s evolution from the scrappy upstarts who made 2017’s brash punk LP G
 uppy\, to the confident\, assured artists behind the comparatively dynamic
 \, unapologetically pop Young Enough.\nGLADIE\nDon’t Know What You’re 
 In Until You’re Out\, the second full-length record from Philadelphia ba
 nd Gladie\, opens with a contemplative instrumental called “Purple Year.
 ” Along with acoustic strumming and a late-night wall of cricket-chirps\
 , cello and gentle horn runs set a dewy\, moonlit stage before second trac
 k and single “Born Yesterday” bursts alive with drums\, bass\, and bri
 ght guitar chord crunch. It’s like a cold\, heart-jolting morning plunge
  as Augusta Koch’s familiar Philly tenor starts in: “It takes me more 
 time\, I’m a little unsteady/I was born yesterday\, I forgot I could be 
 somebody.”Koch realized while writing these songs that she had become an
  entirely different person: a mental\, spiritual\, and physical renaissanc
 e had unfolded over several years that\, together\, constituted an entirel
 y new reality. Everything had changed\, from relationships with friends to
  relationships with alcohol. Being on the other side of these tectonic shi
 fts offered the sort of clarity that you can only get by going through the
  darkness: You Don’t Know What You’re In Until You’re Out. It’s op
 timistic\, but it’s scary\, too—life changes always are. Who will you 
 be at the end of them?\n

 miniature world of many parts being explored\, a map being illuminated\, l

 e and Lloyd be reunited?\n \nDose Your Dreams—meaning: treat your dreams

 nFever Museum is the first LP from the Cleveland and Philadelphia band Orb
 its. Recorded remotely over the course of 18 months while navigating the t
 edium and anxiety of the global pandemic\, Fever Museum is a concise yet s
 onically vast listen. Listeners of members Toby Reif (the Sidekicks) and M
 axwell Stern’s (Signals Midwest\, Timeshares\, Meridian) past output wil
 l find themselves in familiar territory\, yet Fever Museum’s densely lay
 ered vocals\, downtuned guitars\, synthesizers\, and odd timings position 
 the record as a unique vessel for exploring ideas well outside the realm o
 f their past output. Drummers Adam Beck (Into It. Over It.\, Sincere Engin
 eer) and Eric Slick (Dr. Dog\, Waxahatchee) also lend their talents to the
  recordings\, sharing space with Reif’s programming. Bassist Chris Bagli
 vo (Superweaks) and drummer Jarret Nathan (Pears) round out Orbits’ live
  lineup. \n \nThe remote aspect of writing and recording for Orbits was a
  natural fit for Reif and Stern. The two first met on a music forum in 200
 6\, sharing tracks from their high school bands via mediafire links and sn
 ail-mailing burned CDs. Their music careers began in parallel\, with Reif 
 booking shows from his dorm room in Bellingham\, Washington\, and Stern to
 uring from his native Cleveland. After meeting in-person for the first tim
 e in 2011\, the two began traveling the world with their respective projec
 ts\, often crossing paths and occasionally pinch-hitting in each other’s
  bands. It wasn’t until 2020\, with Stern living in Philadelphia and Rei
 f coincidentally finding himself in Cleveland\, that the two began writing
  together. They released their first music as Orbits\, the Rising Tide in 
 the Spirit Room EP\, on New Year’s Day 2021.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nTANUKICHAN\n \nTanukichan is the 
 solo project of classically-trained Bay Area native Hannah van Loon\, whos
 e music screeched to a halt when she discovered what she affectionately ca
 lls “dad rock” in her tween years. Throughout her self described “sh
 eltered” adolescence\, van Loon taught herself guitar by spending hours 
 in front of the radio\, replicating riffs and chords from omnipresent band
 s like The Beatles and Incubus. Although van Loon is the creator and leade
 r of Tanukichan\, the project can be considered a collaboration between he
 r and the Grammy-nominated chillwave pioneer Chaz Bear of Toro y Moi. Afte
 r seeing an early Tanukichan show in 2016\, Bear expressed an interest in 
 working with van Loon\; Radio love\,Tanukichan’s first headbanger of an 
 EP\, arrived on Bear’s own Company Records that same year.The promising 
 four-song project was followed in 2018 by van Loon’s breakout debut LP\,
  Sundays\, which prompted her first solo headlining tour and dates opening
  for artists like Kero Kero Bonito and The Drums. Sundays earned Tanukicha
 n enthusiastic critical acclaim\, with Pitchfork writing that it “captur
 es the spirit of a day whose wide-open nature fosters anxieties as well as
  ambitions” and Rolling Stone lauding its “bruising riffs\, taut groov
 es\, and open-road-ready guitar anthems.” Tanukichan’s sophomore album
  GIZMO is out on March 3rd\, 2023. While still rooted in the eerie shoegaz
 e she’s become known and loved for\, it also sees her go beyond her comf
 ort zone\, incorporating elements of grunge\, industrial synths\, nu metal
  basslines\, and electric guitars that culminate into a captivating wall-o
 f-sound. The result is her most fun-sounding work yet.\nWINTERWhat Kind of
  Blue Are You?\, Winter’s sophomore release with Bar/None Records\, is a
 n emotional excavation of Samira Winter’s purest self.\nMusically\, the 
 LP’s 10 songs reconnect with the earliest incarnation of Winter\, once a
 gain painting with brushstrokes of distorted guitar\, but using them to fu
 el a wiser\, more mature form of sonic liberation. Whereas 2020’s Endle
 ss Space (Between You and I) was steeped in fairytale surrealism and spri
 nglike grace\, her latest offering is crystalline and spartan\, songs stri
 pped to their inner blue core\, Winter’s smoldering shadow self.\nIt’s
  another stunning work in a canon that’s established her as one of Los A
 ngeles’ most enduring\, consistently-head-turning dream poppers\, the me
 lancholy and bittersweet beauty that’s been with her throughout Winter
 ’s existence now pushed to center stage. Strengthened by her ever-increa
 sing powers as a songwriter\, she confronts painful wounds of trauma and d
 espair for the first time on record\, and achieves some semblance of peace
  and healing in the process.\n

 inger\, to try and be a better person. But it’s hard to sit still and sl
 ow down when the world seems so unruly. Monotony is an anthem about the da
 ily tightrope—searching for the right path between passion and apathy. 
 All the while\, I’ve been working with Nikki Glaser. Her fearlessness is
  contagious. Since she never hesitates to tell me what she really thinks\,
  I thought it made perfect sense for Nikki to portray my therapist in the 
 video.” \n \nSometimes\, a change of view can transform a person’s wo

 A can be found with his “shoulder on the concrete” of a pavement\, sco
 ping out the world anew. This granular realignment of perspective serves a

 Pond’s work yet a huge leap forward in its measured songcraft\, melodic

  is a gorgeous album of intimate reflections from a relocated\, renamed\,

 sion between optimism and despair that’s defined much of the past few ye
 ars of American life\, examining the power (or naïveté\, depending on yo
 ur perspective) of positive thinking in the face of chaos and uncertainty.
  The songs here are tender and timeless\, with straightforward arrangement
 s centered around brothers Jack Torrey and Page Burkum’s airtight harmon
 ies\, and the performances are warm and intimate to match\, delivered with
  a soulful\, ’70s-inspired palette of playful Wurlitzer\, breezy guitars
 \, and muscular percussion.\n \nThe Cactus Blossoms broke out nationally i

 ith Kacey Musgraves\, Jenny Lewis\, and Lucius followed\, as did raves fro
 m the New York Times and NPR\, who praised “the brothers’ extraordinar

  when David Lynch tapped them to perform in the return of Twin Peaks\, and
  continued to build on their success with their 2019 sophomore LP\, Easy W

 7PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nCOME\n \nCome is a cult American
  alternative rock band\, formed in Boston by Thalia Zedek (vocals\, guitar
 )\, Chris Brokaw (guitar\, vocals)\, Arthur Johnson (drums)\, and Sean O
 ’Brien (bass).Brokaw and Zedek had been introduced by a mutual friend in
  Boston shortly before Zedek moved to New York to join legendary noise roc
 kers Live Skull in ’86. They stayed in touch\, and Brokaw briefly played
  in Zedek’s side project Via before forming the influential slowcore gro
 up Codeine.\n \nZedek and Johnson first met in the fall of 1988 while on t
 our with their respective bands Live Skull and Bar-B-Q Killers. O’Brien 
 and Johnson were long-time friends and former housemates from the close-kn
 it Athens\, GA\, music scene of the ’80s\, where Sean played guitar and 
 then bass in the Kilkenny Cats\, and each of their bands was featured in t
 he 1987 documentary Athens\, GA–Inside/Out.\n \n1990 found all four musi
 cians living in Boston\, and they decided to join forces to see what might
  happen. The musical chemistry was immediate\, and it wasn’t long before
  the band had its first show and a recording offer from Sub Pop.\n \nCome
 ’s first release was “Car” b/w “Last Mistake\,” the August 1991 
 installment in the first volume of Sub Pop’s Singles Club. The single ma
 de them one of the most highly touted new acts on the underground scene\, 
 and there was more than one label eager to release the band’s first full
 -length effort. Come chose Matador in the US and Placebo in the UK to put 
 out their debut album Eleven Eleven in 1992. The album was a great success
  with both critics and fellow musicians\, and tours followed with Nirvana\
 , Dinosaur Jr.\, Sugar\, and Pavement\, among others. Pitchfork has called
  it “one of the most elusive gems of the Matador catalog”. After the r
 elease\, Brokaw left Codeine\, devoting himself full-time to Come.\n \nCom
 e released their second album\, Don’t Ask Don’t Tell\, in 1994\, again
  on Matador and Placebo. It was to be the last album recorded with the rhy
 thm section of Johnson and O’Brien. Though somewhat calmer than its pred
 ecessor\, it was equally as grave. Among the highlights of the album\, and
  of the whole of the band’s impressive song catalogue\, are the two dark
  ballads\, “Let’s Get Lost” and “Arrive\,” each closing a side o
 f the vinyl edition. Brokaw and Zedek’s emotional dual guitar work rival
 s Verlaine/Lloyd\, chiming and majestic\, cascading into feedback-ridden s
 qualls informed by both punk and metal\, sifted through one of the tightes
 t rhythm sections ever assembled.\n \nCome’s third record\, 1996’s Nea
 r Life Experience\, was recorded with two different rhythm sections: Tara 
 Jane O’Neil and Kevin Coultas from the now-legendary Louisville band Rod
 an\, and Chicago’s Mac McNeilly (The Jesus Lizard) and Bundy Brown (Tort
 oise). It was released on Matador in the United States and on Domino in Eu
 rope.The band’s final release\, 1998’s double album Gently\, Down the 
 Stream\, was again released on Matador/Domino and featured a new rhythm se
 ction of Daniel Coughlin on drums and Winston Braman on bass. After extens
 ive touring on the release in both Europe and the States\, the band went o
 n hiatus\, and both Brokaw and Zedek pursued solo careers and other musica
 l collaborations.\n \n \n \nSUN ORGAN\n \nPhiladelphia\, PA\n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\nMO TROPERMo Troper is truly one of a kind\,
  and that’s never been more apparent than on his fifth full-length\, the
  winkingly titled MTV. Arriving hot on the heels of his 2021 full-length\,
  Dilettante\, the album finds the Portland\, OR-based power pop extraordin
 aire diving further into home-recorded immediacy to make a record that fee
 ls like a strikingly direct conduit to the world of Mo–where heartbreak\
 , hilarity\, and hooks allgo hand-in-hand. “My third record\, Natural Be
 auty\, was super labored over\,” Troper explains. “It was the total op
 posite of where I am now. It cost a lot of money and took a lot of time\, 
 and it just wasn’t really rewarding by the time it was done. So I’ve b
 een less interested in doing that process again.” Most of MTV was writte
 n during\, or in the immediate aftermath of\, a lengthy tour and then quic
 kly captured at home on an 8-tracktape recorder. “I’m just really inte
 rested in writing songs–that’s the most fun part for me\,” he says. 
 “So when it comes to recording\, I think the first pass is usually best.
  The more attempts I make\, the more sterile things become. I’m just kin
 d of pushing that mentality even further now”\n2ND GRADE\n \nRinging fro
 m hi-fi headphones and blown-out boombox speakers alike comes the overload
 ed guitar genius of Easy Listening\, a record of rock ‘n’ roll daydrea
 ms and terminal boredom\, and 2nd Grade’s long awaited second LP on Doub
 le Double Whammy. Like a blue slushy on a hot day\, Easy Listening is a 
 sweet respite. Like the Blue Angels touching down on the Las Vegas Strip\,
  Easy Listening is impossible to ignore. And like a janitor mopping up b
 eer on the floor of the Hollywood Palladium in 1972\, hours after the Roll
 ing Stones have finished “Ventilator Blues” and climbed onto the bus\,
  Easy Listening knows the glory and cost of escapism\, abandon\, and the 
 soul of rock ‘n’ roll. Philadelphia’s 2nd Grade is a band both obses
 sed with and worthy of rock stardom\, and Easy Listening proves their sta
 tus as virtuosos of the power pop renaissance.\n \n \n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nWESTERMAN\n \nUK artist Westerman
  returns with his first offering in two years with the song “Idol\; RE-r
 un” out via Partisan Records. The new track\,produced by James Krivcheni
 a and Westerman\,juxtaposes gentle and celestial sonics with an aggrieved 
 disposition and features artwork by renownedNew York via Portugal Graphic 
 Designer and Illustrator Bráulio Amado. The song was written after Wester
 man emergedfrom a period of disenchantment with making music\, and with th
 e future of his career feeling abstract\, it seemed unclear to Westerman w
 hether the material he was recording would ever be heard. Creatively\, thi
 s offered a strange kind of freedom\, and accommodated some of the most ad
 venturous and unselfconscious songwriting of his career. Finding textures 
 became a central concern taking programming and looping into his own hands
  in a way he never had before\, creating polyrhythmic grooves to lend urge
 ncy to his inner dialogue.”Idol\; RE-run” is the first taste of songs 
 written in this period and provides a hint for what’s to come from Weste
 rman in the coming year. The track featuresJames Krivchenia\, Mikel Patric
 k Avery and Booker Stardrum on drums\, Ben Reed on bass\, Luke Temple on s
 ynth\, Mat Davidson on piano\, Robin Eubanks on the trombone and of course
  Westerman on vocals\, guitar and synth.Speaking about the new song\, West
 erman shares:”The lyrics to the song were written around the same time a
 s the storming of the Capitol. The compulsion towards the pedestal is stro
 ng. The need to scapegoat and revere without logic. Our populists actively
  celebrate their being people who don’t know anything other or better th
 an anyone else\, yet these spectres with their failings conduct our anger 
 and resentment as if they were gods. They are nothing more than the shadow
  of something else\, the face fronting a need to be loved or revered prese
 nt in everyone. And there will always be another face to front.”\nTWAIN\
 n \nHave you ever…\n \n…faced an impossible question\, to be answered 
 at once by a kaleidoscope of wind\, diffusing your bewilderment into thous
 ands of spinning bulbs?\n \n…awoken to hear the person sleeping beside y
 ou speaking a language they do not speak in their waking life? …felt y
 our legs possessed\, to throw you across the room in shapes? …lost you
 r heart\, only to find it on the bank of a cold spring\, in the hands of a
  filling station attendant\, or in the dust swimming through the light of 
 your bedroom window?\n \n Have you ever listened to Twain?\n \n“A lone
 ly day\, I went outside to smoke awhile\,and think about a picture in a bo
 ok:He was laying in the grass in his suit\,as the angler posed in pursuit 
 of the fish”\n \n For the past decade or so\, Mt. Davidson has cultiva
 ted his songs and sounds\, attempting to create a bridge\, a meeting place
 \, between the terrestrial and the mystic.  He is a ponderous and delicat
 e sort of creature\, short and vaguely leonine\, who has spent most of his
  young life abiding in the midlands of transcendence.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nNARROW HEAD\n \nTruly great pop s
 ongs do not require a cheery outlook in order to work\, nor do they pander
  to expectations of syrupy sweet easy-listening. Rather\, the best pop mus
 ic is a matter of refinement and pure intention\, of dialing groove to mel
 ody so that the two might puncture the malaise of everyday living in uniso
 n\, revealing some brief\, sober truth about our shared human condition. O
 n their third LP\, Moments of Clarity (Run for Cover)\, Narrow Head have a
 chieved precisely this feat. Traversing the depths of massive\, churning r
 iffs\, often distorted to the point of violence\, bouncing\, lock-grooved 
 rhythms\, and crystalline\, gorgeously constructed hooks\, the Houston-bas
 ed outfit puts on a masterclass in the art of writing songs that match the
  pain\, pleasure\, and confusion of modern living. Each track is sentiment
 al without being precious\, heavy without unnecessary griminess\, pop-forw
 ard without letting the listener off the hook easy: these songs ask for so
 me form of hurt or desire to be paid back to them in return\, some promise
  that the listener is putting equal skin into the game.\n \n \n \nGRAHAM 
 HUNT\n \nWisconsin Musician Graham Hunt’s latest effort\, “If You Knew
  Would You Believe It?” (Smoking Room Records) is a journey that confide
 ntly tackles pop/rock from every possible sonic angle.  Hunt’s penchant
  for combining wistful melodies with lyrics that make stagnant moments fee
 l improbably vivid compliments an increasingly refined incorporation of 
 ’90s and early ’00s alt-rock touchstones. Through all of the familiari
 ty\, Hunt has managed to develop a style that feels authentically singular
 \, an honest extension of his tastes\, preferences\, and experiences.\n \n

 ealize you don’t fit into it all the time.” It’s no secret that the
  world wasn’t built with most people in mind. For those who exist on the
  fringe\, you learn to pave your own way\, foster your own community\, and
  create your own joy. As a queer person and a daughter of migrants\, Lahey
  learned how to adapt to a world that wasn’t made for her\, and her thir
 d album\, The Answer Is Always Yes\, examines how she finds comfort in the
  discomfort\, whether it’s reveling in absurdity or turning towards expl
 oration. Lahey’s debut album I Love You Like a Brother and its 2019 foll
 ow-up The Best of Luck Club take their focus from the lens of relationship
 s\, but with The Answer Is Always Yes\, Lahey analyzes her otherness throu

 ’s music is based on evoking mood\; their vivid arrangements utilize tim
 e and space to build soundscapes that invite the listener into their world
 . The quintet’s distinct sound pulls from 70s film scores\, the funkier 
 side of jazz\, and the samples that form the foundation of hip hop. They p
 ush the boundaries of instrumental soul and funk with their own approach h
 oned by countless hours in the studio\, studying the masters\, and perhaps
  most importantly\, the ‘tyranny of distance’ that dictates a unique p
 erspective to their music. Hailing from just outside of Melbourne\, Austra
 lia\, their first two albums\, All News Is Good News and Daylight Savings 
 amassed a die-hard fanbase and brought their sound from their home studio 
 to every corner of the globe. The band is now signed to Big Crown Records\
 , joining a lineage of contemporary and classic sounds that have influence
 d Surprise Chef’s music since their formation in2017. Surprise Chef is L
 achlan Stuckey on guitar\, Jethro Curtin on keys\, Carl Lindeberg on bass\

 “moody shades of instrumental jazz-funk” have a bit of everything: pun

 8PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nSTUCK\n \nWorking at a mixing bo
 ard one night\, a catchphrase popped into Greg Obis’ head: “freak freq
 uency.” He was ringing out feedback during his job as a sound engineer\,
  and started to picture the parallels between acoustic physics and politic
 al trends. “If you think about a waveform\, as the frequency rises\, the
  space between the sine waves gets less and less\,” Obis explains. “Wi
 th that downward trend comes constant heightening\, stress and tension.”
  He came to see freak frequency as an apt metaphor for the decline of West
 ern empire\, an inverse relationship between the (positive) deterioration 
 of American hegemony and the (negative) worsening of daily life under that
  fall. It was a fitting title for the new material Obis was planning for S
 tuck\, the frenetic and twisted post-punk outfit he formed in 2018. Inspir
 ed by the doomy social economics of Mark Fisher’s Capitalist Realism\, t
 he bleak worldbuilding of horror games Demon’s Souls and Bloodborne\, an
 d the bombastic yet arty satire of Devo\, Obis channeled his audio analogy
  into Freak Frequency\, an album ringing out with explosive sounds and ide
 as. Though its songs tackle the violence of wealth\, the nightmares of tec
 hnocracy\, and the rise of the conspiratorial layman\, Freak Frequency is 
 Stuck’s quirkiest record to date—compositionally challenging and equip
 ped with menace\, yet dotted with vibrant fun. “Being in a brooding post
 -punk band isn’t that appealing to me\,” jokes Obis. “When things ar
 e bad\, all you can really do is laugh.”\n \n \n \nMESH\n \nPhiladelphi

 7PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nBAYONNE\n \nSince his 2016 debut
  album Primitives\, Bayonne has channeled his vast imagination into an ele
 gant yet wildly experimental form of electronic pop\, equal parts meditati
 ve and mesmerizing. In the making of his latest body of work\, the Austin-
 based artist/producer/multi-instrumentalist otherwise known as Roger Selle
 rs found himself in even greater need of an outlet for his kinetic creativ
 e impulses\, thanks to an intense convergence of events in his personal li
 fe: his father’s diagnosis with and eventual death from cancer\, the end
  of a significant relationship\, and an overwhelming struggle with depress
 ion and anxiety. Deeply informed by a deliberate transformation of his mus
 ical process\, Bayonne’s third full-length Temporary Time ultimately mak
 es for his most expansive work to date—an album of both painfully raw in
 trospection and otherworldly beauty.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nKILTRO\n \nTitled Underbelly\, Ki
 ltro’s sophomore album crystallizes those dreams and experiences into a 
 post-rock manifesto of dazzling beauty. Its songs combine touches of shoeg
 aze\, ambient and neo-psychedelia with the soulful transcendence of South 
 American folk–the purity of stringed instruments\, supple syncopated per
 cussion and elusive melodies that define the works of Latin American legen
 ds such as Violeta Parra\, Víctor Jara and Atahualpa Yupanqui. From the p
 ropulsive\, chant-like groove of “Guanaco” to the art-pop panache of 
 “All the Time in the World\, ”Underbelly is the kind of record that in
 vites you to quiet down and listen\, savoring every single detail.The albu
 m reaches an emotional pinnacle during its second half\, when the majestic
  lament of “Softy”– seeped in exquisite cushions of reverb–segues 
 into the hypnotic reverie of “Kerosene.” It also signals a new chapter
  in the fusion of Latin roots with mainstream rock\, anchoring its sonic q
 ueston a rare commodity: inspired songwriting.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nREMEMBER SPORTS\n \nAfter four al
 bums of expertly crafted pop punk\, Remember Sports follows up last year
 ’s epic Like a Stone with the first EP of their decade-long run. Recorde
 d piece meal in their respective homes\, sometimes together\, sometimes ap
 art\, Leap Day trades the live immediacy of their studio classics for some
 thing cozier\, though no less rousing. The core trio of Carmen Perry\, Cat
 herine Dwyer\, and Jack Washburn have always kept up active home recording
  practices for their solo projects–Carmen as Addie Pray\, Catherine as S
 pring Onion\, Jack under his own name–and here we find them gently foldi
 ng sounds sprung from their bedrooms into their signature brand of basemen
 t rock. Absent a dedicated drummer for the first time in their recorded hi
 story\, the band opts for simple drum machine accompaniment\, lending the 
 music a fresh weightlessness even as Carmen’s arresting vocals and sharp
  lyrics bring gravity in all their righteous anger\, scathing self-reproac
 h\, and disarming tenderness. Musically\, all the thrilling guitar riffs a
 nd grooving bass lines we’ve come to expect are here\, but the gradual r
 ecording process offered the band more opportunity to explore and experime
 nt\, adding on subtle layers of instrumentation\, distortion\, and electro
 nics\, and with them a warm sense of depth. In all\, Leap Dayis a short an
 d sweet\, loose but confident affair\; at once a reminder of Remember Spor
 ts’ absolute mastery of the pop rock anthem and a tantalizing sip from t
 he well of ideas they have yet to plumb.\n

 ke a kid: experimenting\, having fun\, and trying to discover new things a
 bout this work\,” says Pile’s Rick Maguire about All Fiction. It’s h
 is band’s eighth record\, and one that finds the ambitious group assembl
 ing its most texturally complex material yet—despite the fraught inspira
 tion underscoring its restive lyrics. Alongside the blistering drums and s
 corched-earth riffs that first galvanized Pile’s dedicated fanbase\, the
  band has incorporated elegiac strings\, mystifying vocal corrosions\, and
  haunting synths. From the creeping fear of cinematic opener “It Comes C
 loser” to the euphorically ascending keys on ego-shattering closer “Ne
 on Gray\,” All Fiction is an ornate\, carefully paced study on the subje
 ctivity of perception\, the data-shaping despotism of big tech\, and the c
 onnections between anxiety and death. In its most vital moments\, it’s a
 lso a resolute recommitment to the restorative significance of art and ima
 gination.\n \nFor fifteen years\, Pile’s evolving take on rock has earne
 d the group one oft-repeated superlative: “your favorite band’s favori
 te band.” Ceaseless touring took its members from Boston’s basement ci
 rcuit to international festivals\, hitting loftier technical apexes with e
 ach new record. Maguire—the fastidious composer\, evocative guitarist\, 
 and potent voice behind the solo-turned-punk project—gives musical body 
 to his interior world in scream-along-able lyrics that skew surreal. \n
