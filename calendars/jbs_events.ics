 oors8 PM – Show\nBLITZEN TRAPPER\nThere are numbers so vast they exceed 
 the scope of human reckoning\, concepts so immeasurable they surpass our c
 apacity to understand. On their radiant new album\, 100’s of 1000’s\, 
 Millions of Billions\, Blitzen Trapper make peace with the unknowable\, su
 rrendering themselves to forces beyond their control as they explore the i
 nfinite with a broad mind and an open heart. Inspired by singer/songwrite
 r Eric Earley’s fascination with Buddhist texts and meditation (the titl
 e comes from a phrase that appears over and over in the Mahayana sutras)\,
  the album offers a captivating take on rebirth and transcendence\, and th
 e circularity of existence\, navigating its way through the space beyond d
 reams and reality\, beyond gods and mortals\, beyond life and death. The s
 ongs here are as sincere as they are surreal\, rooted in rich character st
 udies and deep reflection\, and unfolding like a riddle-filled journey tha
 t asks many questions and offers no answers. The production is intoxicatin
 g to match\, blending lo-fi intimacy and trippy psychedelia into a mesmeri
 zing swirl of analog and electronic sounds. Add it all together and the re
 sult is a gorgeous\, sprawling collection wrapped in lush layers of synthe
 sizers and washed out electric guitars–a poignant\, expansive exploratio
 n of perception and purpose that manages to look both forwards and backwar
 ds all at once. “This whole project grew out of a box of old four-track
  tapes from the ’90s that I found recently\,” Earley explains of 100
 ’s of 1000’s\, Millions of Billions. “The tapes were full of songs I
 ’d written and recorded back when I was 19 or 20 years old\, and the sou
 nd and the spirit of those recordings got me excited to start writing musi
 c again\, to go back to working the way I did when I was first starting ou
 t.”\nLOUISA STANCIOFF\n“There are times in life when you’re so prese
 nt\, so fully immersed in the moment that you can catch a glimpse of anoth
 er universe\, of a realm beyond our own\,” says Louisa Stancioff. “It 
 might last for a second or an hour\, it might come in the midst of bliss o
 r sadness\, you might be alone or with a lover\, but when it happens\, the
 re’s nothing quite like it.” When We Were Looking\, Stancioff’s stu
 nning debut\, is full of those moments. Written and recorded through a tra
 nsitional\, transient period filled with heartbreak and uncertainty\, the 
 collection is raw and unflinching\, holding nothing back in its bitterswee
 t reckonings with pain\, healing\, acceptance\, and growth. Stancioff writ
 es with a cinematic eye\, conjuring up richly detailed stagings for her em
 otionally- charged character studies sung with a silvery resonance. The so
 ngs’ guitar-and-synth-focused arrangements are immersive and nuanced to 
 match\, thanks in part to the evocative sonic landscaping of producer/keyb
 oardist Sam Kassirer (Josh Ritter\, Craig Finn)\, who proves to be an idea
 l creative foil on the record. Add it all up and you’ve got a dreamy\, n
 ostalgic\, snapshot-filled album that blurs the lines between indie stoici
 sm and folk sincerity–a lush\, cathartic work that hints at everything f
 rom Phoebe Bridgers and Arlo Parks to Big Thief and Waxahatchee as it lear
 ns to find the beauty in grief and rebirth.\n

 two-headed monster\, Finom (fka Ohmme). You can ask them to go into more d

  the answer is going to be polite refusal. No.Co-fronted by Sima Cunningha

 put a premium on change. Produced by Jeff Tweedy in the Wilco Loft\, Not G
 od is a marvel of growth\, a progression from the roots of this collaborat

 the legacies cemented by The Roches\, Roxy Music\, the B52s\, Kate Bush\, 
 Cate Le Bon\, and Wilco.Cunningham and Stewart are brilliant harmonizers\,

 lso be a fight\, holding the line until the volcano erupts. This realistic
  depiction of a creative relationship jolts throughout the songs of Not Go

 their shared love of pop songwriting\, control\, chaos\, and being general

 doing it with a friend. As the globe spins and advancements advance\, it c

  of Admittance is captured once again in the intricate tangle of the fretb
 oards\, soaring in open skies above. Like lens flare cutting through the s
 peakers\; spiderwebs cracking the windshield that holds back all the onrus
 hing reality. Blowing the dust away\, cutting a new path for cognition. As
  is always endeavored…. After 20 years of living on the road in differe
 nt places\, Six Organs of Admittance had returned home to Humboldt County 
 — a far country\, to some\, but still part o f the world through which c
 reatures of all kinds are moving through and contributing to. And some of 
 them are human. Alone together — forming connection and exchange out of 
 thought and expression — no different from the people on the other side 
 of the Redw ood Curtain. It was there\, where Six Organs had long ago emer
 ged\, in the name of everything cycling\, of circles that spiral concentri
 cally and remain unbroken\, the new music was conceived. In moments\, it 
 was as if the future had some – how wrapped around 360 degrees\; elsewhe
 re\, the systems and patterns inside the writing and recording only became
  evident later — like a recognition that cumulus and nimbus clouds which
  passed through the sky the day before contained familiar shapes. Informin

 and lyrical\, threading backward through the time of Six Organs of Admitta
 nce. Almost marinating in it as a way of life. Working on the music and th
 e vocals\, then spending some time with them while steppin g away from the
 m. Walking the dog and coming back to them. Time is Glass is made of that 
 kind of time. Alone time. Recorded in the visceral environs of home\, Tim
 e is Glass is sharply focused\, even as misty impressionist mountains floa
 t through the background. Sweet and spiny\, “ The Mission ” sings its 
 purpose\, before turning abruptly to the orchestral rumble of “ Hephaest
 us ”: rural industrial psychedelia\, ecosystem goth\, synths arcing to l
 ift a helplessly earthbound community into the firmament above. Winding al
 most imperceptibly back into song with “ Slip Away ”\, the time of the
  record becomes clear\, moves fluidly\, relaxed but aware\, from event to 
 event. People and things coming around again. The intuit\, passing through
  wormholes and time\, sounding deep then dissolving into the universal. Th
 e acoustic sounds ringing\, layered suddenly\, then clear again. Explosion
 s of a new kind of distortion. Ecstatic melodies. Communing. The space of 
 a day. The space of a season. Time is Glass\, and Six Organs of Admittanc 
 e is here and will be here\, again.\nTASHI DORJITashi Dorji  is a Bhutane

 eep the spark.” By matching the sharply-written songs of three distinct 
 frontmen with a progressive mix of rock & roll\, electrified folk\, and co

  wide as the band’s own sound. With Easy Company\, Futurebirds’ fifth

 rom singer/songwriters Womack\, Johnson\, and Carter King\, Easy Company f
 eels like a celebration of the tight-knit bonds that have held Futurebirds

 Americana\, psychedelia\, indie folk\, and Southern rock. All these flavor

 d’s toil for meaning in a world of vapid consumerism and commercialism

 tails so close to the edge of a song that you can touch them. And as an Au
 stin-based project\, their music has also always felt strangely and specif
 ically Texan – unhurried\, long drives across an impossible expanse of o
 penness\, refractions shimmering off the pavement in the heat.But on Bad D
 ream Jaguar\, Sun June is unmoored. The backdrop of Texas is replaced by l
 onging\, by distance\, by transience\, and a quiet fear. The only sense of
  certainty comes from the murky past. It’s a dispatch from aging\, when 
 you’re in the strange in-between of yourself: there’s a clear image of
  the person you once were and the places you inhabited\, generational curs
 es and our families\, but the future feels vast\, unclear – and the pres

 DOORS\n9PM SHOW\n \nDIRTY DOLLHOUSE \n\nDirty Dollhouse is the multi-gen
 re music of Philadelphia-based artist Chelsea Mitchell\, a folk chanteuse 
 with classical training and a retro-pop composer with a soft spot for cou
 ntry. After releasing her first lo-fi EP\, Married in the Aviary\, Mitchel
 l received the Tri-State Indie Vocalist of the Year award and the lyrics t
 o her song “Nobody’s Daughter” were showcased in American Songwriter
  Magazine. Joined by light accompaniment for a follow-up EP\, 25 Shades\, 
 saw a departure from traditional folk and embraced a Nashville vibe while 
 2017’s full-length album Vinyl Child was a mixture of darkly contemplati
 ve pop songs and quiet\, intimate confession. Drawing from many muses has
  produced a uniquely diverse catalogue\, but it has also made it near-impo
 ssible to pin down who Mitchell sounds like. In sultry-toned moments you m
 ight hear Nicole Atkins\, a soft bird-like peak could make you think of Ka
 cey Musgraves\, and a certain belt may summon Brandi Carlile. Though her v
 ocals range from soft twang to unabashedly operatic\, it could suffice to 
 say that Mitchell’s songs all fit under the same “singer-songwriter”
  umbrella as her lyrics weave a diary page to life and her band expands on
  structural simplicity with subtle grace. As bassist Joshua Machiz\, drumm
 er Eric Lawry\, and lead guitarist August John Lutz II are now full-time m
 embers\, Dirty Dollhouse has found a new and exciting momentum\, opening f
 or rising stars like Nikki Lane and Amanda Shires and playing to a wider a
 udience.\n \nBREN\nBren is a Philadelphia\, PA based singer/songwriter wr
 iting cathartic pop tunes from a punk heart. Having moved over 10 times in
  her life\, dropped out of college\, ended and started new relationships\,
  Bren knows a thing or two about unexpected change. Breaking through self-
 doubt is a common theme throughout her writing. Distilling influences rang
 ing from Elliott Smith to Mitski to the Pixies\, Bren’s music shares fam
 iliar sentiments of vulnerability and introspection\, serving as your comp
 anion for feelings you may not have even realized you had.\n \nDOMINY\n\n
 Dominy is band featuring the songs of guitarist John Dominy. The band debu
 ted their first album ‘Wet leather’ in 2018\, and has since put out 2 
 additional full length albums. Besides music\, the members of Dominy\, rea

 oovecraft. By purposely eschewing the tired tropes of the Dead cover band 
 world\, they have created a sound and a community as unique and varied as 
 their influences\, while remaining true to the Dead’s rambling\, wanderl
 usty ethos. Founded in 2021 by guitarist Sean Reilly (Mumblr) and drummer 
 Kevin Paschall (Roof Doctor) as an offshoot of their long running psychede
 lic two-piece Brown Rainbow\, they soon enlisted Tommy Fala (Half Thought)
  on keys\, Andrew Meagher (VVeed VVolf) on bass\, Danielle Zabielski on vo
 cals\, and Zach Coleman (Witch Bomb) on guitar. Their music inhabits a vas
 t universe\, flirting with spacious and effected landscapes\, tight and fo
 cused speed metal riffage\, and deep exploratory jazz excursions\, all fra
 med by a deep reverence for the Dead songbook.\n

 eking self-improvement\, we parse through our inner angels and demons\, de
 signating our better tendencies as core parts of our identity and dismissi
 ng problem areas as reflections of past selves we’re bound to outgrow 
 — as if both sides aren’t integral parts of us. Personal growth can be
  a tricky and disingenuous prospect — often further muddied by capitalis
 m\, armchair psychologists and religious zealots — but it’s also an es
 sential\, life-affirming process worth enduring. Box for Buddy\, Box for S
 tar\, the latest album from This Is Lorelei\, explores this conundrum\, fu
 nctioning both as an earnest transformative exercise and a tongue-in-cheek
  takedown of the illusion of transformation.Since 2012\, New York City sin
 ger-songwriter Nate Amos (Water From Your Eyes\, My Idea) has recorded and
  self-released hundreds of songs under the This Is Lorelei moniker\, and p
 erhaps surprisingly\, after a decade plus\, Box for Buddy\, Box for Star m
 arks the first attempt at a traditional\, intentionally written full-lengt
 h album. Amos describes the bulk of This Is Lorelei’s discography as “
 unedited diary entries\,” written and recorded without much forethought\
 , regard for genre or reverence for albums as thematic bodies of work\, so
  oddly enough\, Box for Buddy\, Box for Star is both a fresh start and the
  culmination of years of diligent\, interesting songwriting.\n \n

 sound? It depends on when you ask.The 24-year-old\, Maryland-raised songwr
 iter arrived on the music scene with 2020’s Classical Notions of Happine
 ss\, an album of lo-fi pop and hushed folk songs recorded in her Maryland 
 & Kansas bedrooms. She’d be back by the end of that same year with Somet
 hing To Say To You\, a compilation of two EPs featuring craggy indie rock 
 and brokenhearted acoustic fare recorded in NYC apartment studios with fri
 ends.By 2022 she was swinging for the fences with the pristine pop of Face
  The Wall\, all while shuttling back and forth between Brooklyn and her so
 on-to-be home of Eagle Rock\, LA collaborating on a wide array of projects
  with a who’s who of Gen Z artists: Magdalena Bay\, TV Girl\, Yot Club\,
  Paul Cherry\, Dent May\, Inner Wave.“I don’t think I’ll ever settle
  on a specific sound\,” says Jordana. “I’m just a chameleon.”So he
 r vibrant fourth LP\, Lively Premonition\, which is equal parts Laurel Can
 yon folk and shimmering yacht rock\, should surprise no one.“Maybe it’
 s my LA record\,” she says of the album she worked on with producer and 
 multi-instrumentalist Emmett Kai for the entirety of 2023. “I can’t pi
 npoint exactly what affected it\, but I do think the sun has its beam on m
 e. Through all of these releases\, it’s so cool to see which eras I’ve
  gone through and what I’ve experimented with\,” says Jordana.Though t
 he concept of eras is exhaustingly omnipresent at the moment\, Jordana has
  earned the right to draw the definitive lines between her releases and mu
 sical phases. Her current iteration owes a debt to a deep love for artists
  like The Mamas & The Papas\, Carole King\, Donald Fagen & Walter Becker 
 – all New Yorkers who\, like Jordana\, moved out west and found their so
 unds flourishing.\nRACHEL BOBBITT\nLife runs in rhythmic loops\, from the 
 endless rotations of the earth to the running of tides and yearly rebirth 
 of spring. Rachel Bobbitt knows that the bottom of those cycles can feel p
 retty chaotic. “Every woman I’ve ever talked to is in some amount of p
 ain almost all the time\,” the Toronto-based singer-songwriter says. “
 That could be physical pain\, emotional pain\, familial pain\, but it’s 
 there in cycles.” On her piercing and profound new EP\, The Ceiling Coul
 d Collapse (due July 15th\, 2022\, via Fantasy Records)\, Bobbitt picks th
 rough the dizzying rubble of folk and indie rock for moments of resonant e
 motion and frames them in heartbreaking lyrics and openhearted expanses.\n

 n the follow-up to Four of Arrows\, each member was called in different di

 e puts it simply\, “Time passed and I missed my friends.” As any good 
 relationship built on mutual love\, trust\, and a mountain of shared histo

 her for a decade—were drawn back into one another’s orbits in 2023.  
 Great Grandpa recently made their highly-anticipated and “epic return”
  (Brooklyn Vegan) with the gorgeous track “Kid\,” and “Doom” is an
 other cathartic entry in the band’s beloved catalog. Penned by Pat Goodw
 in soon after the release of 2019’s acclaimed Four of Arrows\, the song

 es\, studios\, and home addresses\, and she eventually left NOLA for New M
 exico where the two year writing process for Safe to Run unfolded. Making 
 the transition to this new environment after spending the better part of a
  decade building a life somewhere else demanded looking around and taking 
 stock. All the heaviness\, sweetness\, levity\, and self-discovery that ha
 d led up to that point began funneling into new songs that moved slower in
  order to dig deeper\, taking on the intricate hues of a desert horizon as
  they came together.\nTWAIN\n“There is nothing remarkable about my life 
 that is necessary to know in order to appreciate the songs\,” says Matth
 ew Davidson of Twain. He describes the project as “a modern folk-opera o
 f indefinite length consisting of songs and images from my life\, a self-c
 aricature of the musician and writer Matthew Davidson.”Twain made his la
 bel debut with Rare Feeling in 2017. The album was aptly hailed by NPR as 
 “at once human and otherworldly\,” by Consequence of Sound as “devas
 tating\, delicate\, meditative\,” and by Uproxx as “cosmic folk\, brig
 ht and sparkling\, but with all the caterwauling and rough bits that the m
 ost stoic traditionalist might desire.” Following the beloved release\,
  Twain played Newport Folk Festival and toured alongside artists including
  Buck Meek\, Langhorne Slim\, and Courtney Marie Andrews. Davidson is a fo
 rmer member of The Low Anthem and Spirit Family Reunion and a contributor 
 to Big Thief\, whose latest album Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in Yo
 u features Davidson’s distinct contributions on six songs. \n

 e people together forever\, whether it be a place\, a song or something yo
 u can’t quite define through words. The origins of Orions Belte stemmed 
 from one of those mystical moments in time\, which spawned a lasting creat
 ive connection. Øyvind Blomstrøm (guitar) and Chris Holm (bass) first me
 t while playing in a touring band for another Norwegian artist. During tha
 t time\, they bonded over their love for instrumental music and began talk
 ing about trying their hand at it themselves. After their work as touring 
 band ended\, they recruited drummer Kim Åge Furuhaug\, one of Holm’s lo
 ngtime friend and collaborators\, to join their new project.The three met 
 in Bergen\, located along the west coast of Norway\, to start working on i
 deas and demos. Instead\, within just a few days\, they ended up recording
  their entire first album\, Mint. From there\, the universe propelled them
  forward\, resulting in a record deal\, their live debut as a band at Norw
 ay’s biggest pop festival Øyafestivalen and the release of their debut 
 record all happening within the following year. Mint drew international in
 terest and praise from outlets including Atwood Magazine\, who called the 
 record “an eclectic fusion of disparate styles and exciting sounds that 
 says what it wants to say through memorable melodies\, ambient drones\, an
 d a stockpile of wicked guitar riffs.”\nJ EMBER\n

  musical journey began in the vibrant port city of Sekondi-Takoradi\, in t
 he Western Region of Ghana. His early fascination with music blossomed int
 o a lifelong passion. From mastering his father’s flute at the tender ag
 e of eight\, to honing his guitar skills under the mentorship of “Uncle 
 Bonku”\, Sammy Lartey and Ebo Taylor\, Ambolley’s musical odyssey has 
 been nothing short of extraordinary. This all led to Ambolley becoming a m

  sound called ‘SIMIGWA-DO’. His name has become synonymous with Simigw
 a music and dance.Coming of age amidst the zenith of Ghana’s highlife er
 a\, Ambolley emerged as a pivotal figure in its evolution\, lending his ta
 lents to esteemed bands such as Houghas Extraordinaires\, Meridians Of Tem
 a and Ghana Broadcasting Band. It was during this time that he caught the
