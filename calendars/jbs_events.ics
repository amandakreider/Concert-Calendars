 is solo debut . Speedy pump up jams that pair perfectly with our modern li

 re the same charm and top notch musicianship that have become a Dr. Dog ha
 llmark.\n \nDog fans might enjoy the posi-dub vibes of “Don’t Worry”
  or be familiar with the Armageddon love song trope expertly rendered in
 ”7th Seal”. But you don’t have to be a Dr. Dog fan to dig this recor
 d. There is truly something for everyone. If you’re into ripping guitar 
 solos and coda rants\, “Spooked by the Kooks” should do the trick. If 
 crazed story songs with killer choruses are more your speed\, then we sugg
 est “The Runaway”. If you want to bop and boogie your way through mode
 rn terrors try “Military Applications”. If you can’t get enough exis
 tential synth apathy and optimism\, “Rider” will get you through the n
 ight.\n \nThis product is guaranteed to make you move and is probably pret

 T HAS BEEN CANCELLED*\n8PM – Doors9PM – Show\nKIDS RETURN\nKids Return
  is first and foremost a great story of friendship between Adrien Rozé an
 d Clément Savoye. It was in Paris\, at the age of 13\, that the two music
 ians met. Like Japanese director Takeshi Kitano’s film from which it tak
 es its name\, the French duo’s project explores the depth within the fal
 se naivety of childhood\, and the evocative power of nostalgia when it blu
 rs the line between joy and sadness.\n \nKids Return’s sound sits somewh
 ere between the Mamas and the Papas’ Californian pop\, Vladimir Cosma’
 s orchestrations and the modesty of Joe Hisaishi’s soundtracks. It draws
  on Blur’s energy and MGMT’s vocal harmonies\, while revisiting these 
 Anglo-Saxon influences with the precision and delicacy of bands like Air. 
 The result is a romantic and melancholic melody\, a laboratory of emotions
  that can be thought of in pictures.\n \nKids Return is also\, at a time w
 hen music is essentially produced on computer\, the choice of an organic\,
  ample and living sound. With their analogical gears\, which they like to 
 see as children’s toys\, in the manner of François de Roubaix\, Clémen
 t and Adrien compose\, produce and write together. It is between their sma
 ll Parisian studio and a house suspended between the mountains of the Pyre
 nees that their pieces are born\, then orchestrated by a string quartet in
  the countryside. From this journey emerged a dreamlike and sensory music\
 , a call to dream\, an invitation to extract oneself from time.\n

 to incorporate a more contemporary pop awareness. Korine’s forthcoming S

  Orchestra (WPO) is a village brass band known for their kinetic beats and
  blaring horns. Their sound is inspired by Balkan brass\, the energy of 60
 s free jazz\, and underground dance music. WPO has been active throughout 
 the Philadelphia region since their founding in 2006. They throw dance par
 ties\, pop up at parks\, and play concert stages\, festivals\, weddings\, 
 parks and dank basements. They parade and protest for social and environme
 ntal justice\, and stir up joy for weddings and other celebrations. They h
 ave collaborated with groups across the artistic spectrum\, including Tris
 ha Brown Dance Company\, Pig Iron Theater Company\, Martha Graham Cracker\
 , RJD2\, Spiral Q\, and others. \nRUMI KITCHEN + OOLALA (9:00 PM)\nOOLALA
  is the greatest Space RockRoll band in the UNIVERSE.  Free to inter-dim
 ensionally transcend the gravitational fabric of the cosmos and experience
  all points in space\, all forms of energy\, all states of matter\, and al

 fs from which everything is made and un-made.  The group is led by RUMI K
 ITCHEN – Kentucky transplant\, now long-time Germantown\, Philadelphia-b

 visual artist.  He is best known for his work with OOLALA\, absurdist fu

 folk collective The Spinning Leaves\, his stint on the TV show America’
 s Got Talent\, and now his vibrant collaboration with the 15-piece horn an
 d drum band West Philadelphia Orchestra.  Their upcoming “The Cosmic Tr

 hings you’ve ever heard – funky tuba\, heavy compound beats\, classic 
 hype vocals\, balkan horn lines\, frantic angular cosmic jazz.  It is to

 en lurking in the basement of Philadelphia since early 2016\, building a s
 ound that while often nostalgic\, defies easy categorization. By setting t
 he intimate details of singer Jody DeMarco’s singularly queer experience
  against a soundscape that takes cues from the atmosphere of classic horro
 r films\, they’ve produced a unique set of torch songs for misfits and w
 eirdos of all kinds. With their first EP “Movie Was Bad\,” they unveil
 ed an offbeat pop sensibility that draws to mind both the manic spirit of 
 the Talking Heads and the aching balladry of Roy Orbison. Their second pro
 ject “Mascula” took a much darker turn both sonically and lyrically\, 
 exploring American masculinity and the layers of violence that lie under i
 ts surface. The two EPs were released together in 2018 as either side of a
  12″ record on Born Losers Records\, recorded by Hunter Davidsohn (who h
 as worked with Porches\, Frankie Cosmos\, and Sheer Mag) over a weekend at
  Business District Recordings. In December of 2020\, they released the ret

 on On Film is a Modern Rock Outfit from Philadelphia. Their music draws fr
 om a variety of influences including electro-pop\, funk\, chillwave and da
 nce music with an Alternative Rock core and their sound has been compared 
 to A Flock Of Seagulls\, Duran Duran\, and Glass Animals. Formed in 2014 b
 y Jeff Familetti (vocals\, keys\, guitar) and Ryan Bayler (keys\, guitar) 
 as a synth pop duo\, the band recently went through some dramatic changes 
 with the addition of two new members\, Joe Tockett (Drums) and Cameron Kyn
 ett (Bass).  As a result\, the group’s sound has blossomed\, a shift th
 at has garnered local attention and resulted in a feature as one of WXPN
 ’s Local Picks\, as well as a prime spot on the lineup for 2nd Street Fe
 stival. The group is currently in the process of recording their third EP\
 , “Repercussions.”  Their first two EPs\, “Repetitions”  and “
 Reflections\,” were recorded at Headroom Studios by Mark Watter and are 
 currently available for streaming online.  \n \nSTATIC SHAPES (9:00 PM)\n
 Long-time fixtures of the Philadelphia indie rock scene\, singer/guitarist
  Steve Yutzy-Burkey (The Swimmers)\, drummer Mike Kennedy (Audible\, Lefty
 ’s Deceiver)\, bassist Rick Sieber (The Swimmers)\, and keyboard player 
 Alex Yaker (Roomtone) formed Static Shapes in 2019 around a loose collecti
 on of songs that envisioned their Philadelphia riverside neighborhood grad
 ually drifting out to sea. The band dug deep into the limitations of 2020 
 to painstakingly record the sprawling lockdown sounds of the self-produced
  Give Me The Bad News\, which featured on numerous year-end best-of lists\
 , including the San Diego Union-Tribune’s.  Facing another blurring and
  uncertain year\, Kennedy became immersed in William Basinski’s classic 
 The Disintegration Loops as inspiration for a series of glitchy\, 4-track 
 cassette loops that evoked this heavy sense of disruption and loss.  Yutz
 y-Burkey layered melodies over the loops\, drawing from the constant echoe
 s of history encountered in his work restoring pipe organs and renovating 
 Philadelphia’s crumbling buildings.  Merging this backdrop with dreams 
 of an eerily altered future\, the 5-song Blursday EP continues Static Shap
 es’ probing of the limits of home studio production. Dream-pop synths an
 d warbling guitar hooks float over skittering bass and drums\, while shimm
 ers of those original tape loops occasionally rise to the surface.\nSOLD (
 8:00 PM)\n \nFour dudes playing post-punk or indie or whatever you call gu
 itar rock these days. Been there\, done that—in spades. But for those un
 yielding music lovers who like a little chill in their punk or a little go
 th in their indie\, there’s SOLD.  SOLD is a four-piece from Philly. Fo
 r the past 5 years they’ve been crafting a simple and ownable style of r
 ock music that’s centered around heavy rhythms\, spooky synths\, simple 
 guitar\, and melodic vocals.  Their debut LP\, “A New Wind\,” is out 
 now\, recorded at Philadelphia’s renowned Headroom Studios by Kyle Pulle
 y and Mark Watter. \n \n \n

 urrealist lyrics create ‘as perfect an expression of rock’n’roll’s

  and ‘genuinely dangerous\, like one last rave before the apocalypse’\

 t following a 4 year hiatus\, they returned in September with their second
  studio album\, The Talkies\, heralded as ‘one of the biggest comebacks 
 of the year ‘ (Mary Anne Hobbs\, 6Music). The Press landscape hailed it 
 as ‘more abstract and more focused than their debut’ with outstanding 
 reviews from the likes of Crack Magazine (9/10)\,The Irish Times (5*) and 
 Record Collector(5/5). The Talkies was Recorded in November 2018 at Ballin
 tubbert House\, Ireland–the alien construction of the house and its corr
 idors help to navigate their cataclysmic sound within a world of its own. 
 And this enigmatic manor became Gilla Band’s sonic playground. It is an 
 album which is living and breathing\, in a continual state of metamorphosi

  – Show\nAEON STATION\n \nAeon Station’s Observatory is an epic stat
 ement more than a decade in the making\, with miles of timeless melodies a
 nd the kind of overpowering songwriting that will reaffirm your belief in 
 life itself. Longtime Wrens member Kevin Whelan’s first solo album draws
  heavily from the perseverance of the soul\, resulting in rock music posse
 ssing an infectious and inspiring sonic uplift. If you’re familiar with 
 Whelan’s past work\, these ten tracks bear a certain and unmistakable fa
 miliarity—but they also mark an exciting new chapter in Whelan’s music
 al career\, as he steps out with more vulnerability than ever before.\n \n
 Observatory came together carefully for Whelan—over the course of 14 ye
 ars\, specifically\, as clusters of demos and sketches were eventually ass
 embled and recorded largely by Whelan himself\, with assistance from Wrens
  bandmate Jerry MacDonald as well as Tom Beaujour in his Union City record
 ing space. “It’s the best I’ve done and may ever do frankly\,” Whe
 lan states. “It’s written over such a long period of my life. Music I 
 did in the past was tinged with expectations or presumptions\, but this ti
 me\, it was just for me.”\n \nThe long gestation of Observatory means 
 that a lot of lived experience went into making this album. As time passed
 \, Whelan got married\, started a family\, and moved to the Asia Pacific r
 egion for a period of time\; at 15 months old\, his son (now eight) was al
 so diagnosed with autism\, and the title of Observatory itself is inspir
 ed by Whelan’s own relationship with his son.\n \n“The moment you’re
  told your child is not ‘neurotypical\,’ your whole world expands in w
 ays you never imagined\,” he explains. “Even though he doesn’t speak
  much at all\, or look at anyone directly\, you can see him observing ever
 ything around him. The album title reflects upon the stories within the so
 ngs — each one observing a certain situation or feeling.”\n \nWhelan
 ’s scope of musical vision on Observatory is wide open and free with po
 ssibilities—at once recalling the reflective wisdom of Bruce Springsteen
 \, Broken Social Scene’s huge anthemic burn\, and the Wrens’ own pulsi
 ng-with-life take on rock music. Above all\, this is music not only for dr
 eamers but for those who realize and appreciate the enormity of every mome
 nt. “It’s about never letting go about those dreams and your passion\,
 ” he states. “The album starts from a place of realizing that everythi
 ng is temporary\, what we love eventually changes or leaves us\, and regar
 dless we continue to search and find our way back home.”\nCATHEDRAL CEIL

 o reflect on their own privileges.   The debut album was enthusiasticall
 y received and made it onto multiple end of the year accolades. It was ran
 ked in Stereogum’s “The 40 Best New Bands of 2020\,” Brooklyn Vegan
 ’s “Top 55 Albums of 2020\,” and nominated for The Alternative’s 
 “Best Debut Album of the Year\,” among many others. \nGREG ELECTRIC (
 9:00 PM)\nJust who is Greg Electric\, and more importantly\, are they here
  to save us all from monotonous music? Welp\, Greg Electric is a new band 
 from Philadelphia\, a DIY super-group of sorts\, and yes… they most defi
 nitely are here for that. The band\, which features current and former mem
 bers of Nine of Swords\, Ted Nguyent\, and Loose Tooth\, released their se
 lf-titled debut EP today\, a furiously skronky beast of hardcore yelps and
  tangled chord progressions. Rachel Gordon’s (Nine of Swords\, Baby Moll
 usk) vocals offer that perfected bite and bark balanced with detached conc
 ern\, teaming with disdain between a melodic and rhythmic approach. The ba
 nd\, Mike McGilloway (guitar)\, Dan Wolf (drums)\, and Kian Sorouri (bass)
  dart back and forth\, guitars intertwining as the rhythms quake behind th
 em. It’s all delivered with an agile chaos\, densely working up fits of 
 sputtering rage and sludgy grooves. The band set up sing-song melodies jus
 t to shatter them with brutality moments later. It’s all pretty menacing
  and abrasive\, and it’s a most impressive debut.\n

 re\, the universe propelled them forward\, resulting in a record deal\, th
 eir live debut as a band at Norway’s biggest pop festival Øyafestivalen
  and the release of their debut record all happening within the following 
 year. Mint drew international interest and praise from outlets including
  Atwood Magazine\, who called the record “an eclectic fusion of disparat

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \nQUASI\n \nBreaking the Balls of History 
 is Quasi’s tenth record\, landing ten years after their last record\, on
  February tenth. Three tens\, which aligns with the thirty years they’ve
  played together. Sam Coomes and Janet Weiss have become Pacific Northwest
  icons\, and Quasi has always felt so steadfast— their enduring friendsh
 ip so generative\, their energy infinite\, each album more raucous and cat
 chy and ferocious and funny than the last. But we were wrong to ever take 
 Quasi for granted. For a while\, they thought 2013’s intricate Mole City
  might be their last record. They’d go out on a great one and move on. T
 hen in August 2019 a car smashed into Janet’s and broke both legs and he
 r collarbone. Then a deadly virus collided with all of us\, and no one kne
 w when or if live music as we knew it—the touring\, the communal crowds\
 , the sonic church of the dark club—would ever happen again. “There’
 s no investing in the future anymore\,” Janet realized. “The future is
  now. Do it now if you want to do it. Don’t put it off. All those things
  you only realize when it’s almost too late. It could be gone in a secon
 d.”Under lockdown\, Portland’s streets fell still\, airplanes vanished
 \, wildlife emerged. And with the obliterated normal came an unexpected gi
 ft: uninterrupted time\, hours every day\, to make art. Quasi couldn’t g
 o on the road\, so they got an idea: they would act as if they were on tou
 r and play together every single day. Each afternoon\, Sam and Janet bunke
 red down in their tinypractice space and channeled the bewilderment and ab
 surdity of this alien new world into songs. Janet’s strength returned an
 d rose to athlete-level stamina. “When you’re younger and in a band\, 
 you make records because that’s what you do\,” Sam said. “But this t
 ime\, the whole thing felt purposeful in a way that was unique to the circ
 umstances.” They knew they would keep it to just the two of them playing
  together in a room. They knew they’d record the songs live and together
 \, to capture a moment.The incredible result of those sessions is Breaking
  the Balls of History\, recorded in five days and produced by John Goodman
 son at the legendary Robert Lang Studios in Shoreline\, WA. Here are two a
 rtists at their prime\, each a human library of musical knowledge and expe
 rience\, entirely distinctive in their songcraft and sound. In Quasi-form\
 , the band becomes alchemically even greater than the sum of its parts: Ja
 net’s galloping drums and Sam’s punk-symphonic Rocksichord and their i
 ntertwining vocals make something gigantic\, anthemic.\nBAT FANGS\n\n \nBo
 rn of a shared love of hair metal\, partying\, and the reckless spirit of 
 rock and roll\, Washington D.C./ Carborro\, NC duo Bat Fangs brings a fier
 y combination of shredderistic guitars and heavily harmonized hooks.  Gui
 tarist/vocalist Betsy Wright (Ex Hex) and drummer Laura King (Mac McCaugha
 n\, Speed Stick) united after playing a show together in their respective 
 projects\, with the goal of pushing Wright’s pop focused songwriting in 
 a bolder\, brasher direction. Taking up the primary songwriting role and s
 hifting to guitar\, Wright steps outside of the typical Ex Hex sound with 
 Bat Fangs’ rowdy rock.\n

 sist Joe Lally were in a band together\, they were the rhythmic architects
  for Fugazi\, an organization whose decade and a half of disciplined progr
 essivism provided a necessary bridge between the zenith of late-punk expre
 ssion and everything alternative in rock that followed. In 2016\, the two 
 were enlisted by guitarist Anthony Pirog in a conspiracy to subvert and re
 imagine the power trio\, bringing fully into the 21st Century a form that 
 may have reached near perfection with Hendrix’s Band of Gypsys on the ve
 ry first day of the 1970s.\nWith a self-titled recording scheduled for rel
 ease in the Spring of 2018 on Dischord\, the Messthetics will widen the re
 ach of a decisive instrumental music that so far\, they have only shared w
 ith a privileged handful of east coast and southern audiences. Across its 
 eight original compositions and one cover\, Anthony guides the sound throu
 gh complex changes and harmonic densities that might compound\, but never 
 confound or muddy its connection with the listener’s body. Recorded by B
 rendan in their practice space\, the group’s debut gives Anthony ample o
 pportunities to swap guitar textures and styles as freely as an octopus ch
 anges patterns.\n \n— Dr. Thomas Stanley (aka Bushmeat Sound)\nJAMES BRA
 NDON LEWIS TRIO\nI would think James would have a personal reference for s
 uch a title as Eye of I\, the poetic ululation of the trio of words\, not 
 unlike the sound of this particular human trio of music messengers. To my 
 mind\, Eye of I is in reference to a focus\, and a focus which is not enti
 rely disciplinarian but one infused with the spiritual. Having played a ti
 ny bit with James at a loose session some years back\, I felt the sound of
  meditation\, prayer\, and thoughtfulness in both a search and an acceptan
 ce of vibratory creative impulse. We just went into an elemental wave of s
 onics as a free thought recognition of peace and bliss in concordance with
  all the wild conflict this universe has in both its real world and dreams
 cape. The music went outside of any physical construct of time\, space and
  judgment\, feeling perfectly imperfect as a cosmologic unification of ope
 n-hearted love.\nJames’ compositions are at once the sole realizations o
 f his own “living music” concepts\, the aura of actually “seeing” 
 the music as it is conjured and gifted from the composer’s mind\, spirit
 \, and body\, as well as being defined to a profound degree by the interac
 tion of players James finds himself compatriot to. The JBL Trio on Eye Of 
 I is James on tenor\, cellist Christopher Hoffman and percussionist Max Ja
 ffe—augmented on two tracks by the guest appearance of cornetist Kirk Kn
 uffke\, and joined on a third by Anthony Pirog\, Brendan Canty. and Joe La
 lly of The Messthetics—players who have been on the scene\, and who are 
 obviously in the mix for JBL as these serious soul serenaders are not afra
 id to dig in hard to the dynamics being proffered\, always allowing a soph
 istication to present a sentient\, sometimes placid (with youngblood rambu
 nction\, underlying and playful) groove\, a groove dealing with intellect 
 as natural guidance—music reflecting the masters and finding its own com
 munitarian grace.\n— Thurston Moore\, 2022 London\n

 our life when we feel magic in the air. When new love arrives\, or we find
 ourselves lost in a moment of creation with others who share our vision. A
  sense that: this iswho I want to be. This is what I want to share.It’s 
 a fleeting feeling and one that Kyle Thomas\, the singer-songwriter who re
 cords andperforms as King Tuff\, found himself longing for in the spring o
 f 2020.But knowing he couldn’t simply recreate this time in his life at 
 will\, Thomas—who hails fromBrattleboro\, Vermont—set out to write a l
 ove letter to those cherished moments of inspirationand to the small town 
 that formed him. The one where he first nurtured his songwritingimpulses\,
  bouncing ideas off other like-minded artists. The kind of place where the
  changing ofthe seasons always delivered a sense of perspective and fresh 
 artistic inspiration. Where he felta deeper connection with nature and sen
 se of community that had once been so close at hand.\n \n“I wanted to ma
 ke an album to remind myselfthat life is magical\,” he reflects.And so\,
  Thomas seized upon his memories\, creating what he calls “an album abou
 t love andnature and youth.”The result isSmalltown Stardust\, a spiritua
 l\, tender and ultimately joyous record that mightcome as a shock to those
  with only a passing knowledge of the artist’s back catalog. OnSmalltown
  Stardust\, Thomas takes us on his journey to a place where past and prese
 nt collide\,where he can be a dreamer in love with all that he sees. Image
 s of his youth abound: fromRoute 91 which runs through his hometown (in 
 “Smalltown Stardust”)\; to Redtooth\, a spectrewho used to roam the st
 reets (“Bandits Of Blue Sky”)\; to old friends\, old haunts and old dr
 eams(“Always Find Me”)\; to Vermont’s Rock River\, which gave its na

 and we can’t rewind/ Cuz people grow and placeschange/ But my love for y

 ses the ‘50s-inspired music video for their single “Wish You Were a Gi

 which stars band members Anastasia\, Eva\, and Emily as distraught runaway
 -brides and housewives\, is a statement on rejecting traditional feminine 
 ideologies. “The entire video plays with this fictitious smokey dollhous
 e world where the band runs away from all feminine responsibilities and fo
 rced ideologies\,” director Ambar Navarro shares.  Throughout “Wish Y
 ou Were a Girl\,” we see the trio trapped within the confines of heteron

 \, indie rock and the folk tradition of storytelling through song. From th
 e age of five\, Vazer began learning classical piano but became fascinated
  with the world of bands and songwriters\, having grown up in a household 
 with her family’s 60s and 80s record collection. A self-taught guitarist
 \, she stole her father’s guitar during highschool and started to learn 
 Nirvana\, The Strokes and Death Cab for Cutie based on internet guitar tab
 s. In true DIY fashion\, she soon began writing songs in punk highschool b
 ands\, capturing early sounds on old PCs with built-in microphones and a p

 ?’ (Perpetual Doom records\, Brooklyn NY) was nominated for the 2020 Aus
 tralian Music Prize and listed in several best-albums-of-the-year lists in
 cluding NME Australia and The Music. Mixed by Ali Chant (Soccer Mommy\, PJ
  Harvey) and produced by Robert Muinos\, the album features hit singles 
 ‘For A Moment’ and ‘Higher Places’ as featured on Rolling Stone Au
 stralia. With a new album on the horizon\, Nat Vazer will be embarking on 
 her first US tour in March 2023 playing at New Colossus Festival 2023 (New

 Power Pop band from Philadelphia\, PA led by singer-songwriter Tyler Asay.
  The band has released three full-length albums\, most recently 2022’s E

 f the Aïr region”) welcomes you to Agadez\, the capital city of Saharan
  rock. Playing for over 25 years\, Etran has emerged as stars of the local
  wedding circuit. Beloved for their dynamic repertoire of hypnotic solos a
 nd sun schlazed melodies\, Etran stakes out a place for Agadez guitar musi
 c. Playing a sound that invokes the desert metropolis\, “Agadez” celeb
 rates the sounds of all the dynamism of a hometown wedding. Etran is a fam
 ily band composed of brothers and cousins\, all born and raised in the sma
 ll neighborhood of Abalane\, just in the shadow of the grand mosque. Sons 
 of nomadic families that settled here in the 1970s fleeing the droughts\, 
 they all grew up in Agadez. The band was formed in 1995 when current band 
 leader Moussa “Abindi” Ibra was only 9 years old. Whereas other Tuareg
  guitarists look to Western rock\, Etran de L’Aïr play in a pan-African
  style that is emblematic of their hometown\, citing a myriad of cultural 
 influences\, from Northern Malian blues\, Hausa bar bands\, to Congolese S
 oukous. It’s perhaps this quality that makes them so beloved in Agadez. 
 “We play for the Tuareg\, the Toubou\, the Zarma\, the Hausa\,” Abindi
  explains. “When you invite us\, we come and play.” Their music is roo
 ted in celebration\, and invokes the exuberance of an Agadez wedding\, wit
 h an overwhelming abundance of guitars\, as simultaneous solos playfully p
 ass over one another with a restrained precision\, forceful yet never over
 indulgent. \n

  – Show\nCharlotte Adigéry & Bolis Pupul\nCultural appropriation and ra
 cism. Social media vanity. Post-colonialism and political correctness. The
 se are not talking points that you’d ordinarily hear on the dancefloor b
 ut Charlotte Adigéry and Bolis Pupul are ripping up the rulebook with the
 ir debut album Topical Dancer. The Ghent-based duo\, who broke out with th
 eir 2019 Zandoli EP on Soulwax’s record label DEEWEE\, are rare storytel
 lers in electronic music: they take the temperature of the time and funnel
  them into their playful synth concoctions – never didactic and always w
 ith a knowing wink.\nTheir new studio record – which cements them as a d
 uo under both their names for the first time and is co-written and co-prod
 uced by Soulwax – is both a triumph of kaleidoscopic electro-pop and “
 a snapshot of how we think about pop culture in the 2020s.” It captures 
 Charlotte and Bolis’s essence as musical collaborators and the conversat
 ions they’ve had over the past two years on tour\, as well as their pers
 pectives as Belgians with an immigrant background\, Charlotte with Guadelo
 upean and French-Martinique ancestry and Bolis being of Chinese descent.\n
 Conceptually\, the pair wanted to put these observations and ideas about c
 ulture today and the zeitgeist into a “time capsule shaped like an egg
 ”\, with the idea that you could “bury the album somewhere”\, says B
 olis\, for future generations to find and figure out what the 2020s were a
 ll about through their eyes. The egg is “a visual shorthand\,” they sa
 y\, “for new life and unhatched potential.”\nZandoli was partly an exp
 loration of what it means to be a woman of Caribbean heritage growing up i
 n Belgium – Pitchfork called it “striking\, playful electro pop with a
  sly sense of humour”. Topical Dancer\, however\, expands their worldvie
 w outwards. Songs like “Hey” question the shallowness of ‘wokeness
 ’ and searches for a utopia of “equality\, harmony and integrity”\, 
 while ‘Reappropriate’ is a fluttery R&B-ish song about liberating ones
 elf from sexual trauma. Charlotte sings across English\, Dutch\, Creole an
 d French\, her signature deadpan delivery at times recalling a vogue house
  vocalist or a Black Mirror-style virtual assistant\, giving the album a h
 ypnotic\, fourth-world quality.\n

 not serving anyone (except maybe 5 guys that all look identical and own ev

 ce here. We are a group of five boys from Miami\, Florida just looking for
  a good time. Now if you’d like to take the time\, we’d like to tell y
 ou how this shit-show began. On a warm summer evening in the year of our L
 ord 2015\, a young college drop out is in his backyard\, guitar in hands s
 cribbling lazily on a loose sheet of paper. He taps his pen on his chin in
 tensely\, contemplating the first and only line that reads: “I’m going
  down”. he stares down at his pathetic excuse for an opening line and ca
 lls it a night. “eh\, I’ll try again tomorrow” he says. This is his 
 mantra. He didn’t know it then\, but that pathetic little line would be 
 the birthplace of a little band called Mustard Service and that pathetic l
 ittle line would be the opening line of a little album called Zest Pop. 
 For the next two years Marco Rivero and Armando Baeza (producer and forme
 r drummer) wrote and recorded the debut album “Zest Pop”\, bringing in
  their friends Gabriel Marinuchi (guitar)\, Augusti Di Catarina (bass\, ba
 cking vocals)\, and Leo Cattani (keys) to play the songs live as a full ba
 nd. they played a few push-moshing\, beer-spilling\, gear-breaking\, cop-c
 alling\, arrested-getting shows throughout Miami-Dade County\, managing to
  amass a small yet passionate fanbase in their home town. In those years\
 , GarageBand™  transitioned into ProTools™\, recordings evolved into
  mastered tracks\, and  small house shows turned into packed venues. Th
 eir Debut album was released in June of 2017\, relying solely on live sho
 ws and streaming platform algorithms for promotion and exposure. The algo
 rithm gods took pity on these poor fools and granted them a world-wide aud
 ience over the span of the next three years\, leading into the release of 
 their sophomore album titled “Ces’t La Vie” in March of 2020.`\n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nFAKE NAMES\n \nIf credibility wer
 e currency\, Fake Names’ wealth would be off the charts. Composed ofBria
 n Baker (Minor Threat\, Bad Religion\, Dag Nasty)\, Michael Hampton (S.O.A
 .\,Embrace)\, Dennis Lyxzén (Refused\, INVSN\, The [International] Noise 
 Conspiracy)\,Johnny Temple (Girls Against Boys\, Soulside) and the newest 
 member Brendan Canty(Fugazi\, Rites of Spring)\, the band is a veritable p
 ost-hardcore dream team. Howeverinstead of rehashing the past\,Expendables
 is a reinvention that sees the band dialingback the distortion and leaning
  into the melodies. The result pairs their unparalleledpedigree with a pop
  sensibility that’s slightly unexpected and wholly satisfying. “On our
 last record [2019’sFake Names] the general influences were 70’s U.K. p
 unk and power-pop\; butit wound up with a little classic rock vibe as well
 \, like the Vibrators meetsAerosmith. We never saw that coming!” Baker e
 xplains. “The pop influences are a littlemore out front on this one and 
 the production really helps it shine. It sounds more direct\,more urgent.
 ”While the band’s debut album was actually a demo that Epitaph founder
  and Baker’s BadReligion bandmate Brett Gurewitz wanted to release as is
 \, forExpendablesthe bandenlisted producer Adam “Atom” Greenspan (IDLE
 S\, Yeah Yeah Yeahs). “On the newrecord the guitar tones are pretty clea
 n\, which is not what we normally do\, but we’re oldenough to know to gi
 ve Atom’s ideas a shot because that’s the whole point of bringingsomeo
 ne in\,” Baker explains. “Atom had me play through amps and pedals way
  out ofmy comfort zone\, but the sounds he built were perfect for the song
 s.” That sense ofcuriosity is a major thematic component ofExpendables\,
 from the chiming harmonies of“Go” to the moody melodicism of “Madtow
 n” (the latter of which could have just as easilybeen written in 1982 as
  it could in 2022). There’s also an economy to these songs that’sroote
 d in the fact that they were recorded in the span of a week\, which elimin
 ated theoption to add superfluous instrumentation or arrangements. The res
 ult is an album thatretains the members’ purity of vision in a strikingl
 y refreshing way.\n

  solitude transform into the islands that sit blue along the horizon. The 
 Salish Sea curves along her homelands\, and when the singer is close to th
 is water she is reminded of her grandmother\, how she looked out at these 
 same islands\, and she’s held by spirit and memory.\n \nThe Land\, The W
 ater\, The Sky rises and falls\, in darkness and in light\, but even in it
 s most melancholy moments it is never despairing. That is the beauty of re
 turning home. When you stand on ancestral lands it is impossible to be alo
 ne. You feel the arms and hands that hold you up\, unwilling to let you fa
 ll into sorrow or abandonment. In her songs Katherine Paul has channeled t
 hat feeling of being held. In every note she has written a love letter to 
 indigenous strength and healing.\n \nThere is a joy present here\, a fierc
 e blissfulness that comes with walking the trails along the river\, feelin
 g the sand and the stones beneath her feet. It is the pride and the certai
 nty that comes with knowing her ancestors walked along the same land\, dip
 ped their hands into the water\, and ran their fingertips along the same b
 ark of cedar trees.\n \nThis is a story of hope\, as it details the joy of
  returning. Katherine Paul’s journey home wasn’t made alone\, and the 
 songs are crowded with loved ones and relatives\, like a really good party
 . And as the songs walk us through the land it is important we hover over 
 the images and the beauty\, the moments that mark this album as site speci
 fic. The power of this land is woven throughout\, telling the story of nar
 row waterways\, brush strokes\, salmon stinta\, and above all healing.\nCL

  man armed only with a banjo and a bass drum can be a formidable force\, e
 specially if his name is William Elliott Whitmore.  With his powerful vo
 ice and honest approach\, Whitmore comes from the land\, growing up on a 
 family farm in Lee County\, Iowa.  Still living on the same farm today\,
  Whitmore has truly taken the time to discover where his center lies\, and
  from that he will not be moved.\n \nWhitmore has repeatedly carved his ow
 n path\, honoring the longstanding tradition of folk music throughout his 
 nearly 20 year career\, while always allowing his blues\, soul and punk ro
 ck influences to shine through.  Getting his first break opening for his 
 friend’s hardcore band with just a banjo in hand\, he would discover ban
 ds like The Jesus Lizard\, Bad Brains\, Lungfish and Minutemen and soon le
 arn to play his own brand of rural\, roots music with that same DIY ethic.
 \n \nWilliam Elliott Whitmore has been back and forth across the United St
 ates and to cities around the world.  He’s toured with such diverse act
 s as Frank Turner\, Trampled By Turtles\, Clutch and Chris Cornell to name
  a few.  He’s appeared on some of the biggest stages around the world i
 ncluding Stagecoach Fest\, Byron Bluesfest (Australia) and End of the Road
  Fest (UK).  His willingness to take his show to any playing field has pr
 oved invaluable as he turned strangers to diehards with every performance.

 8PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nFUCKED UP\n \nI was sent an unfi

 ts. I couldn’t stop listening to the rough mixes I received. A friend as
 ked me how the record was. I replied\, “My God\, Fucked Up have made the
 ir Screamadelica.”\n \nAnd psych-rock-groove it is. The drums mixed wid
 e\, propensity for drones\, for delay pedal\, for repetition\, groove. The
  politics and aesthetics of hardcore married to an “open format” appro
 ach to genre. Elements of doo-wop\, krautrock\, groove\, digital hardcore.
 \n \n“None of Your Business Man” opens the album in familiar enough te
 rritory\, a sax-assisted exit from an office space. But things get psyched
 elic very quickly. By the time the title track arrives\, Mike Haliechuk is
  whispering\, wah pedals are in full effect\, and we’re wearing oversize
 d t-shirts and pinwheeling. “Accelerate\,” the lyrical centerpiece of 
 the album\, storms in like Boredoms on a bullet train and dissolves into a
  digital nightmare. The album closer\, “Joy Stops Time\,” finds Fucked
  Up at their most Düsseldorfian\, nearly eight minutes of blissful motori
 k.\n \nAt the center of it all is Damian Abraham’s scream—a man chaine
 d\, a man tortured\, a true protagonist. The effect is one of an epic\, ev
 ery chapter attempting its own narrative devices\, its own genre hybridiza
 tion—and it works\, it works so insanely well. The drama unfolds like a 
 miniature world of many parts being explored\, a map being illuminated\, l
 ocation by location.\n \nAs with David Comes to Life\, there is a story h
 ere. David—who once came to life—is now indentured to a desk job. Davi
 d meets the elderly Joyce who closes his eyes\, opens his mind\, and sends
  him on a spiritual journey. David embarks on his own metaphysical odyssey
 . He sees a stage adaptation of his own life. He speaks to an angel in a l
 ightbulb. He sees an infinite series of universes as simulations within si
 mulations.\n \nMeanwhile\, Lloyd—Joyce’s lover—was sent\, decades ag
 o\, by Joyce on the same odyssey\, but was lost in the void. Lloyd seeks t
 o be found and reunited with his lover. Where will David end up? Will Joyc
 e and Lloyd be reunited?\n \nDose Your Dreams—meaning: treat your dreams
  as you would a dream\, allow yourself to be lost within them\, allow them
  to open your heart and your mind\, enjoy them as you would a drug. Reach 
 out for my hand and pull me close.\n \n—Owen Pallett\n \nJune 2018\n

 nFever Museum is the first LP from the Cleveland and Philadelphia band Orb
 its. Recorded remotely over the course of 18 months while navigating the t
 edium and anxiety of the global pandemic\, Fever Museum is a concise yet s

 axwell Stern’s (Signals Midwest\, Timeshares\, Meridian) past output wil
 l find themselves in familiar territory\, yet Fever Museum’s densely lay
 ered vocals\, downtuned guitars\, synthesizers\, and odd timings position 
 the record as a unique vessel for exploring ideas well outside the realm o
 f their past output. Drummers Adam Beck (Into It. Over It.\, Sincere Engin
 eer) and Eric Slick (Dr. Dog\, Waxahatchee) also lend their talents to the
  recordings\, sharing space with Reif’s programming. Bassist Chris Bagli
 vo (Superweaks) and drummer Jarret Nathan (Pears) round out Orbits’ live
  lineup. \n \nThe remote aspect of writing and recording for Orbits was a
  natural fit for Reif and Stern. The two first met on a music forum in 200
 6\, sharing tracks from their high school bands via mediafire links and sn
 ail-mailing burned CDs. Their music careers began in parallel\, with Reif 
 booking shows from his dorm room in Bellingham\, Washington\, and Stern to
 uring from his native Cleveland. After meeting in-person for the first tim
 e in 2011\, the two began traveling the world with their respective projec
 ts\, often crossing paths and occasionally pinch-hitting in each other’s
  bands. It wasn’t until 2020\, with Stern living in Philadelphia and Rei
 f coincidentally finding himself in Cleveland\, that the two began writing
  together. They released their first music as Orbits\, the Rising Tide in 
 the Spirit Room EP\, on New Year’s Day 2021.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nTANUKICHAN\n \nTanukichan is the 
 solo project of classically-trained Bay Area native Hannah van Loon\, whos
 e music screeched to a halt when she discovered what she affectionately ca
 lls “dad rock” in her tween years. Throughout her self described “sh
 eltered” adolescence\, van Loon taught herself guitar by spending hours 
 in front of the radio\, replicating riffs and chords from omnipresent band
 s like The Beatles and Incubus. Although van Loon is the creator and leade
 r of Tanukichan\, the project can be considered a collaboration between he
 r and the Grammy-nominated chillwave pioneer Chaz Bear of Toro y Moi. Afte
 r seeing an early Tanukichan show in 2016\, Bear expressed an interest in 
 working with van Loon\; Radio love\,Tanukichan’s first headbanger of an 
 EP\, arrived on Bear’s own Company Records that same year.The promising 
 four-song project was followed in 2018 by van Loon’s breakout debut LP\,
  Sundays\, which prompted her first solo headlining tour and dates opening
  for artists like Kero Kero Bonito and The Drums. Sundays earned Tanukicha
 n enthusiastic critical acclaim\, with Pitchfork writing that it “captur
 es the spirit of a day whose wide-open nature fosters anxieties as well as
  ambitions” and Rolling Stone lauding its “bruising riffs\, taut groov
 es\, and open-road-ready guitar anthems.” Tanukichan’s sophomore album
  GIZMO is out on March 3rd\, 2023. While still rooted in the eerie shoegaz
 e she’s become known and loved for\, it also sees her go beyond her comf
 ort zone\, incorporating elements of grunge\, industrial synths\, nu metal
  basslines\, and electric guitars that culminate into a captivating wall-o
 f-sound. The result is her most fun-sounding work yet.\nWINTERWhat Kind of
  Blue Are You?\, Winter’s sophomore release with Bar/None Records\, is a
 n emotional excavation of Samira Winter’s purest self.\nMusically\, the 
 LP’s 10 songs reconnect with the earliest incarnation of Winter\, once a
 gain painting with brushstrokes of distorted guitar\, but using them to fu
 el a wiser\, more mature form of sonic liberation. Whereas 2020’s Endle
 ss Space (Between You and I) was steeped in fairytale surrealism and spri
 nglike grace\, her latest offering is crystalline and spartan\, songs stri
 pped to their inner blue core\, Winter’s smoldering shadow self.\nIt’s
  another stunning work in a canon that’s established her as one of Los A
 ngeles’ most enduring\, consistently-head-turning dream poppers\, the me
 lancholy and bittersweet beauty that’s been with her throughout Winter
 ’s existence now pushed to center stage. Strengthened by her ever-increa
 sing powers as a songwriter\, she confronts painful wounds of trauma and d
 espair for the first time on record\, and achieves some semblance of peace
  and healing in the process.\n

  formed in 2008 under the name Twin Sister\, quickly garnering critical at

  influential fixture of independent music ever since. The group released t
 heir debut LP In Heaven (2011) via Domino\, and in 2012 their song Meet th
 e Frownies was sampled by Kendrick Lamar and Dr Dre on The Recipe. Having 
 left Domino and changed their name to Mr Twin Sister\, the group re-emerge
 d in 2014 with the low lit disco and funk of their self-titled Mr Twin Sis

  Bear\, TIME\, and many others.  In 2018 the group released Echo Arms\, t
 heir most popular track to date\, and Salt\, their third and most diverse 
 album yet. 2021 saw the release of the group’s fourth full length LP Al 
 Mundo Azul\, a vibrant\, surreal record that swaps the group’s restraine

  narrative from Lucha\, Y La Bamba’s seventh album\, would be to chisel 
 away a story within a story within a story into the illusion of something 
 singular. “Lucha is a symbol of how hard it is for me to tackle healing\
 , live life\, and be present\,” Luz Elena Mendoza Ramos\, lead vocalist 
 and producer of Y La Bamba\, says of the title behind the album which tran
 slates from Spanish to English as ‘fight’ and is also a nickname for L
 uz\, which means light. The album explores multiplicity—love\, queerness
 \, Mexican American and Chicanx identity\, family\, intimacy\, yearning\, 
 loneliness—and chronicles a period of struggle and growth for Mendoza Ra
 mos as a person and artist.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nWESTERMAN\n \nUK artist Westerman
  returns with his first offering in two years with the song “Idol\; RE-r
 un” out via Partisan Records. The new track\,produced by James Krivcheni
 a and Westerman\,juxtaposes gentle and celestial sonics with an aggrieved 
 disposition and features artwork by renownedNew York via Portugal Graphic 
 Designer and Illustrator Bráulio Amado. The song was written after Wester
 man emergedfrom a period of disenchantment with making music\, and with th
 e future of his career feeling abstract\, it seemed unclear to Westerman w
 hether the material he was recording would ever be heard. Creatively\, thi
 s offered a strange kind of freedom\, and accommodated some of the most ad
 venturous and unselfconscious songwriting of his career. Finding textures 
 became a central concern taking programming and looping into his own hands
  in a way he never had before\, creating polyrhythmic grooves to lend urge
 ncy to his inner dialogue.”Idol\; RE-run” is the first taste of songs 
 written in this period and provides a hint for what’s to come from Weste
 rman in the coming year. The track featuresJames Krivchenia\, Mikel Patric
 k Avery and Booker Stardrum on drums\, Ben Reed on bass\, Luke Temple on s
 ynth\, Mat Davidson on piano\, Robin Eubanks on the trombone and of course
  Westerman on vocals\, guitar and synth.Speaking about the new song\, West
 erman shares:”The lyrics to the song were written around the same time a
 s the storming of the Capitol. The compulsion towards the pedestal is stro
 ng. The need to scapegoat and revere without logic. Our populists actively
  celebrate their being people who don’t know anything other or better th
 an anyone else\, yet these spectres with their failings conduct our anger 
 and resentment as if they were gods. They are nothing more than the shadow
  of something else\, the face fronting a need to be loved or revered prese
 nt in everyone. And there will always be another face to front.”\n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nNARROW HEAD\n \nTruly great pop s
 ongs do not require a cheery outlook in order to work\, nor do they pander
  to expectations of syrupy sweet easy-listening. Rather\, the best pop mus
 ic is a matter of refinement and pure intention\, of dialing groove to mel
 ody so that the two might puncture the malaise of everyday living in uniso
 n\, revealing some brief\, sober truth about our shared human condition. O
 n their third LP\, Moments of Clarity (Run for Cover)\, Narrow Head have a
 chieved precisely this feat. Traversing the depths of massive\, churning r
 iffs\, often distorted to the point of violence\, bouncing\, lock-grooved 
 rhythms\, and crystalline\, gorgeously constructed hooks\, the Houston-bas
 ed outfit puts on a masterclass in the art of writing songs that match the
  pain\, pleasure\, and confusion of modern living. Each track is sentiment
 al without being precious\, heavy without unnecessary griminess\, pop-forw
 ard without letting the listener off the hook easy: these songs ask for so
 me form of hurt or desire to be paid back to them in return\, some promise
  that the listener is putting equal skin into the game.\n \n \n \nGRAHAM 
 HUNT\n \nWisconsin Musician Graham Hunt’s latest effort\, “If You Knew
  Would You Believe It?” (Smoking Room Records) is a journey that confide
 ntly tackles pop/rock from every possible sonic angle.  Hunt’s penchant
  for combining wistful melodies with lyrics that make stagnant moments fee
 l improbably vivid compliments an increasingly refined incorporation of 
 ’90s and early ’00s alt-rock touchstones. Through all of the familiari
 ty\, Hunt has managed to develop a style that feels authentically singular
 \, an honest extension of his tastes\, preferences\, and experiences.\n \n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nALEX LAHEY\n \n“Living in a wor
 ld that wasn’t made for you makes you pretty strong and adaptive\, and y
 ou find the fun in it\,” says Alex Lahey. “It also makes you realize h
 ow absurd everything is. With ‘The Answer Is Always Yes\,’ I wanted to
  get weird because the world is weird\, and it’s even weirder when you r
 ealize you don’t fit into it all the time.” It’s no secret that the
  world wasn’t built with most people in mind. For those who exist on the
  fringe\, you learn to pave your own way\, foster your own community\, and
  create your own joy. As a queer person and a daughter of migrants\, Lahey
  learned how to adapt to a world that wasn’t made for her\, and her thir
 d album\, The Answer Is Always Yes\, examines how she finds comfort in the
  discomfort\, whether it’s reveling in absurdity or turning towards expl
 oration. Lahey’s debut album I Love You Like a Brother and its 2019 foll
 ow-up The Best of Luck Club take their focus from the lens of relationship
 s\, but with The Answer Is Always Yes\, Lahey analyzes her otherness throu
 gh different lenses\, from its isolating effect to the surrealism and humo
 r it instills.\n \n \n \nLIZA ANNE\n \nIndie rock sensation Liza Anne dis
 covered songwriting as a young girl at summer camp\, during a guitar lesso
 n workshop. Inspired\, from that moment forward she added melodies for her
  poetry and prose. As a teenager\, she followed the thread of her love for
  music from quiet Saint Simons Island\, GA\, where she was raised\, to Nas
 hville to attend Belmont University\, during which time she self-released 
 two albums that now boast over 50 million streams.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nSURPRISE CHEF\n \nSurprise Chef
 ’s music is based on evoking mood\; their vivid arrangements utilize tim
 e and space to build soundscapes that invite the listener into their world
 . The quintet’s distinct sound pulls from 70s film scores\, the funkier 
 side of jazz\, and the samples that form the foundation of hip hop. They p
 ush the boundaries of instrumental soul and funk with their own approach h
 oned by countless hours in the studio\, studying the masters\, and perhaps
  most importantly\, the ‘tyranny of distance’ that dictates a unique p
 erspective to their music. Hailing from just outside of Melbourne\, Austra
 lia\, their first two albums\, All News Is Good News and Daylight Savings 
 amassed a die-hard fanbase and brought their sound from their home studio 
 to every corner of the globe. The band is now signed to Big Crown Records\
 , joining a lineage of contemporary and classic sounds that have influence
 d Surprise Chef’s music since their formation in2017. Surprise Chef is L
 achlan Stuckey on guitar\, Jethro Curtin on keys\, Carl Lindeberg on bass\
 , AndrewCongues on drums\, and Hudson Whitlock—the latest member who doe
 s it all from percussion to composing to producing. Their self proclaimed 
 “moody shades of instrumental jazz-funk” have a bit of everything: pun
 chy drums\, infectious keys\, rhythm guitar you might hear on a Studio One
  record\, and flute lines that could be from a Blue Note session. But when
  you step back and take in the entirety of their sound and approach\, you
 ’ll hear and see a group greater than the sum of its parts.\n
