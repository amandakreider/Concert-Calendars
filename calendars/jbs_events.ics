 – Doors8PM – Show\nRAMP LOCAL SHOWCASE\n\n \nGODCASTER\nGodcaster is a
 n experimental and hard rock band ephemerally founded by Judson Kolk and B
 ruce Ebersole when they were eight and eleven years old. Since then they
 ’ve experimented with quite a few different styles and have had several 
 incarnations of the band. The current cast consists of: David Mcfaul (voca
 ls\, keys)\, Von Kolk (flute\, guitar\, vocals)\, Bruce Ebersole (guitar)\
 , Sam Pickard (drums)\, Jan Fantana (bass) and Judson Kolk (vocals\, guita
 r). The band is known for their ecstatic live performances\, serendipitous
  visual make-believe\, and gritty gut dials. Delve into the fervencies of 
 their sword-like barrage.\nTOMATO FLOWER\nTomato Flower is the result of l
 ong-lasting friendships and overlapping collaborations that found Austyn W
 ohlers\, Mike Alfieri\, and Jamison Murphy (and later adding bassist Ruby 
 Mars) looking for the balance between taut guitars and experimental pop mu
 sic. The Baltimore-based quartet melds irresistible melodies with rhythmic
  trickery and unexpected structures\, bending genre at will. Math rock\, d
 ub\, and bossa might flash by well before the outro. Formal constraint bec
 omes an opportunity for play and surprise\; the pop form becomes a psyched
 elic capsule.\n \n \nTURBO WORLD\n\n \nTurbo World is the sunny and shady 
 brainchild of co-conspirators Stephe Cooper and Caroline Bennett. Best kno
 wn as the mastermind behind avant-prog boppers Cloud Becomes Your Hand and
  a member of Guerilla Toss\, Cooper continues to stand out for his madcap 
 compositions that embody the spirit and ethos of avant rock groups Aksak M
 aboul & Slapp Happy. Joining forces with Bennett\, the manic scribe\, sing
 er\, and multimedia wizard of digital hardcore duo Stice\, their debut alb
 um\, My Challenger\, is an experimental prog-opera that leads listeners o
 n a surreal\, animated jaunt through the world of organized crime. The alb
 um’s north star is Joey the Hitman aka Max Kurschner\, whose 1973 interv
 iew on The David Susskind Show\, forever immortalized on YouTube\, serves 
 as inspiration and source material. They are joined live by Ryan Power\, J
 ake Lichter (Stice)\, and Calvin Grad (Big French).\nKOLB\nA classically t
 rained opera singer who spurned opera for lo-fi pop\, an indie-rocker\, an
 d an experimental saxophonist walk into a karaoke bar. \nThis isn’t a jo
 ke set-up. It’s the origin story of Tyrannical Vibes\, the playful\, de
 ceptively brilliant new album from Kolb—a.k.a. Brooklyn-based songwriter
  Mike Kolb—with a little help from his friends\, vocalists Carolyn Hiett
 er (Sweet Baby Jesus\, Financial Collapse) and Ani Ivry-Block (Palberta\, 
 Shimmer\, Fire Roast). After spending four years as a touring member of th
 e electro-pop duo Water From Your Eyes\, all the while self-releasing the 
 occasional EP or tape\, Kolb is properly introducing himself as a solo art
 ist with Tyrannical Vibes. The album\, due out September 30 via Ramp Local
 \, is a gem of lo-fi wonder\, drawing influence from karaoke outings and c
 ramming more melodic ideas into 25 minutes than gravity would seem to allo
 w.\n\n\n

  – Show\nDOMINIC ANGELELLA (Record Release)\nYou’re walking along the 
 shoreline of a pond or a small man-made lake kind of thing. It’s not imp
 ortant how it got there\, but the light is important. It’s good soft pin
 k stuff. There’s some vibrant green moss and skipping rocks and cattails
 \, cricket sounds and plenty of quiet. The air is pretty comfortable\, but
  it’s good you brought a sweatshirt. The trees around the pond are being
  reflected in the still water\, creating a rorschach of tripped out nature
  screensaver visuals. Nice. Let’s chill for a little bit.\n \nMy friend 
 Dominic Angelella’s new record Silver Dreams Don’t Move Me is great. I
 t’s the best one he’s made so far and I think you should check it out.
  He’s a super funny and sensitive person and I think he lets those quali
 ties shine through on this one. The arrangements are pulled back and delic
 ate in a way that compliments these relatively no-frills songs\, but don
 ’t worry! It still rocks when it’s supposed to. The layers are always 
 revealed in multiple listens to Dom’s stuff. For somebody who’s been a
 round as much as he has\, he’s just a really self-effacing and unpretent
 ious writer.\n \nDom has played bass for Lucy Dacus for the last couple ye
 ars which seems like it’s been fruitful and positive for everyone involv
 ed. Before that he spent time in some big Philly bands like mewithoutYou a
 nd Hop Along + a couple other ones. He also has a sick band with Eric and 
 Ricardo called Lithuania. The list is long\, but that’s not why we’re 
 here. Back to the pond.\n \nYou’re wearing some shit like Crocs or Birke
 nstocks (no shade I wear that stuff too)\, and the air feels good on your 
 toes. I was curious how work is going\, but it seems dumb to talk about th
 at right now. Your new haircut really suits you. I’m stoked to make dinn
 er and drink some beers when we leave. The sun went down behind the trees 
 about an hour ago and it’s getting darker\, but we definitely have plent
 y of time to get back to the car. Why don’t we do this more often? We sh
 ould start. I’m free next Sunday until like 2\, I’ll text you when I g
 et up.\n \n \n \nAIR WAVES\nNicole first found solace in her guitar\, com
 posing escapist songs with fantastical stories and catchy choruses.  Air 
 Waves serves up fantastic imagery with unforgettable melodies.  You will
  no doubt catch yourself\, hours later\, singing them.  Schneit writes t
 he viral melodies that\, neither sloppy nor generic\, follow you through a
  day or two before you’re drawn back to listen to them again.\n \n \n \

 PM – Show\nAOIFFE NESSA FRANCES\nIn spring of 2020\, Aoife Nessa Frances
  moved out of the city for the first time in her life. After packing up he
 r things in Dublin\, she moved to rural County Clare on the west coast of 
 Ireland\, and there\, amidst the stillness\, she worked on the songs that 
 would become her second album\, Protector. The resulting body of work deft
 ly juxtaposes golden hours and arguments\, affection and alienation\, and 
 above all marks a crucial period of her life that was transformative and l
 eft her wiser.\n \n“I might have been running away from my problems\,”
  she admits. “I was disconnected from myself and from nature\, but I fou
 nd peace far away from the city\, where there were no distractions. I isol
 ated myself with nothing to do but make music.” Writing Protector provid
 ed Frances an essential sounding board for this journey. “I felt a growi
 ng inner strength that guided me through the making of this album. It was 
 like sculpting with my eyes closed\, this intense sense of self-preservati
 on leading me and growing with each song I wrote. When I started\, I didn
 ’t recognise myself. With each song\, I became more human.”\n \nAoife 
 spent that summer with her dad and two sisters. “It was a very special t
 ime for my family as we had never been that tight knit before\,” she say
 s\, “and we all became very close…driving the country roads and swimmi
 ng in the Atlantic Ocean and lakes of Clare. I had one CD in my car: Jim S
 ullivan’s UFO and we listened to it over and over again.” Like many pe
 ople in their late twenties shaking off youthful rebelliousness\, Frances 
 experienced a solidification of familial ties like never before\, and felt
  the formation of a protective\, impenetrable shell. “For me\, Protector
  acknowledges the part of myself that steers me towards a brighter path. T
 he almost psychotropic power of nature gave me a connection I never felt b
 efore. As the countryside seeped into me and lines of communication opened
  up with my family\, I developed an ability to perceive myself and my choi
 ces within an expanded world.”\nINDIGO SPARKE\n \n“To be at the edge\,
  at the precipice of anything\, requires deep surrender. It’s like dying
  over and over again. In the tidal throes of life at its fullest and most 
 intense is the space where grace and strength is fortified and cultivated\
 , is what I am learning” Indigo Sparke ruminates on her magnetic second 
 full-length album Hysteria\, a huge and beautiful sweeping work\, one that
  possesses a rare\, reflective power. From the first few notes\, in the fi
 rst song\, Blue\, something chilling and captivating pierces straight into
  the listener’s chest. With harmonies reminiscent of the voices in our h
 eads\, she examines love\, loss\, grief\, a newly realized rage\, her hist
 ory\, dreams\, and the emotional weather patterns surrounding those sensat
 ions: her words tell the stories\, and the sounds act them out. It’s a d
 iary built for big stages. ‘Hysteria’ arrives just a year after her st
 riking\, minimalist debut\, Echo. Here though\, Sparke offers an expansive
  body of work—it’s a simultaneously nostalgic yet clear and complex co
 llection that expands her sound and outlook. \n

  – Show\nDELICATE STEVE\n“I’ve spent most of my life trying to escap
 e the sound of the electric guitar\,” says Steve Marion. That’s a rath
 er surprising confession considering that\, under the name Delicate Steve\
 , Marion has spent the better part of the last decade establishing himself
  as one of the most wildly innovative and widely revered players in the ga
 me. He’s recorded with Paul Simon\, been sampled by Kanye West\, toured 
 in the Black Keys\, and released four critically acclaimed albums of genre
 -bending instrumental music. He’s your favorite musician’s favorite mu
 sician\, a virtuoso songwriter\, producer\, and performer who occupies a l
 ane entirely his own in the modern indie landscape\, but he’s never like
 d the sound of the electric guitar? “I’ve tried everything under the s
 un to get away from it\,” he explains. “Until now.”\n \n \n \nWritt
 en and recorded on a 1966 Fender Stratocaster that reignited his love for 
 the instrument\, Delicate Steve’s captivating new album\, After Hours\, 
 marks a first for Marion\, an earnest\, easygoing collection that revels i
 n the simple joys of plugging in and playing. The songs are sweet and bree
 zy here\, pairing vintage soul grooves with mesmerizing\, wordless melodie
 s\, and Marion’s production work is suitably subtle and restrained\, ste
 pping back in all the right places to let the album’s masterful performa
 nces speak for themselves. In another first\, Marion teamed up with outsid
 e musicians on the record\, bringing in a group of all-star players includ
 ing renowned bassist Shahzad Ismaily (Yoko Ono\, Marc Ribot) and famed Bra
 zilian percussionist Mauro Refosco (David Byrne\, Atoms For Peace) to help
  flesh out the arrangements and stretch his sonic boundaries. The result i
 s Marion’s warmest\, most magnetic work to date\, an inviting\, immediat
 ely accessible album that manages to balance thoughtful introspection and 
 carefree bliss in equal measure.\n

 like Christopher Cross and Donald Fagen\, but with a lo-fi spark. (They’
 ve embraced the label “smooth-fi.”) The group was formed in Philadelph
 ia by singer/multi-instrumentalists Thomas Crystal and Benjamin Louisiana.
  They self-released Work Drugs’ full-length debut\, Summer Blood\, in mi
 d-2011 before partnering with Chicago-based Bobby Cahn Records\, which rel
 eased a flurry of records that followed. After the song “Rad Racer” fr
 om their debut was featured in a commercial for Urban Outfitters later tha
 t summer\, their second album\, Aurora Lies\, came out in November. A set 
 of acoustic versions of existing songs\, Cayman Islands Sessions\, arrived
  before the end of the year. In 2012\, they released both Absolute Bearing
  and Delta\, with the Amore EP following in February 2013. Another full-le
 ngth set\, Mavericks\, appeared that summer. Still with Bobby Cahn Records
 \, their sixth LP of original material\, Insurgents\, arrived in March 201
 4\, with Runaways on its heels that fall and Cayman Islands Sessions\, Vol
 . 2 in December. In the meantime\, Work Drugs maintained a regular touring
  schedule\, usually with an expanded lineup\, earning support slots for ba
 nds spanning Two Door Cinema Club\, Peter Bjorn and John\, Umphrey’s McG
 ee\, and Battles\, to name a few. Still sporting a tranquil\, yacht-side v

 ded Method Acting\, which was released in August 2016. Preceded by the sin

  of unrequited love\, and learning to balance the imperative nature of sel
 f-worth with desire. Inspired by high-profile artists like Fiona Apple\, N
 ick Hakim\, and Amy Winehouse\, she pulls contemporary swells from pop mus
 ic and overlays them with intimate string and piano arrangements. Pair tha
 t with her affinity for classic films\, vintage landscapes\, and the roman

 Artists You Should Know from Philadelphia on NPR music\, “Singer-songwri

  packaging an artist who boasts both a faux-fur coat vintage Hollywood loo
 k\, and a smoky-voiced after-hours lounge sound. Below the surface\, thoug

 MSHOW – 9 PM\nBESPHRENZ (11:00 PM)\nBesphrenz (BEST-friends) is a duo ba
 sed out of Philadelphia\, Pa. They enjoy genre blending\, serial chilling\
 , tequila drinking\, and writing songs in a shed. \nSPIRIT HAUS (10:00 PM
 )\nSpirit Haus formed late in 2014 as a lofi recording project by singer/s
 ongwriter\, Bruno Catrambone\, of the indie-pop band CRUISR and alt-folk o
 utfit Former Belle. In-between tours\, Catrambone worked on songs by colle
 cting little demos of ideas and recording them with just a mic and a lapto
 p. When the demos started to take shape and turn into finished songs\, he 
 decided to release them as they became complete\; Starting with his first 
 single\, ‘I Know You’re Worried’\, followed by a cover of Broken Soc
 ial Scene’s\, ‘Lover’s Spit’.  After his initial releases\, not s
 ure if anything would become of the project\, Catrambone spent the followi
 ng two years on and off the road with CRUISR (supporting tours with the li
 kes of the 1975\, Misterwives\, PVRIS\, Matt & Kim)\; putting recording an
 d future releases for Spirit Haus on hold. In 2018\, having some time at h
 ome again\, the project was revisited with a new approach and concentratio
 n on home-production and songwriting.  Teaming up with CRUISR band mate\,
  Andy States\, the two co-produced and mixed the first single from his new
  set of Spirit Haus songs\, ‘You Don’t Love Me (Like You Used To)’ f
 ollowed by their second co-production\, ‘Talk (feat. Lucy Stone)’.  S
 pirit Haus has taken on a larger presence in Catrambone’s music concentr
 ation as he spent most of 2019-2021 demoing and releasing singles with new
  music on the way in 2022.\nCATHERINE MOAN (9:00 PM)\nCatherine Moan is th
 e time-bending solo electronic pop project of Angel Jefferson. Angel pays 
 tribute to the style and instrumentation of late 80’s early 90s pop musi
 c. Adrift in a sea of nostalgic bliss\, the music goes beyond being comple
 tely a throwback act\, with a production imbued with the modern glow of mo
 re contemporary synth-oriented indie electro clash.\n

  – Show\nSADURN\nThere’s a palpable feeling of intimacy throughout eve
 ry moment of Radiator\, the debut album from Philadelphia’s Sadurn. The
  band’s spare-yet-satisfying instrumentation\, diary-like lyrics\, and g
 raceful vocal harmonies bring you in extraordinarily close\, breaking down
  any walls between artist and listener to offer fleeting glimpses of life
 ’s most internal moments—as well as one of the most compelling debut r
 ecords in some time.\n \nSadurn started as the solo project of Genevieve 
 DeGroot\, who picked up the guitar in 2015 in an effort to delve deeper in
 to songwriting. “I came to the game really late relative to most people\
 ,” DeGroot explains\, “I didn’t start playing guitar and really writ
 ing songs until after college. I’d always been a singer but I just felt 
 like I needed an instrument to really write songs on.” It wasn’t long 
 until DeGroot was creating the music that would eventually become Sadurn.
  “When you reach into a new creative outlet\, it’s really exciting bec
 ause there’s just so much there. I didn’t have this idea that I was go
 ing to go and become a musician\, but I was learning new chord progression
 s and writing\, and I’d moved to Philly and was surrounded by other song
 writers.” One of these fellow musicians was guitarist Jon Cox\, who join
 ed up with DeGroot to form an early incarnation of Sadurn. The two starte
 d playing DIY shows in the city and released several homemade\, charmingly
  lo-fi EPs\, then in early 2020\, a chance experience kicked off the next 
 phase of Sadurn. “My friend Amelia [Swain] was just learning to play dr
 ums\, we started playing some of my songs together and it just made sense\
 , we both had this feeling that we had to do this.” The group was soon j
 oined by Tabitha Ahnert who had recently taken up bass\, and Sadurn’s n
 ew lineup was complete.\n \nDOLL SPIRIT VESSEL\nThe longer you live\, the 
 more life there is to forget. This is particularly true for Kati Malison\,
  songwriter and frontman of Doll Spirit Vessel. She wrote What Stays\, out
  August 12th via Disposable America\, as she was realizing just how little
  of her past she truly remembered. The things she could recall seemed clos
 er in nature to knowledge than to memory- not a flow of experience\, but a
  chronology of facts\, as though she’d read a book about her life and no
 t lived each wonderful\, terrible\, boring\, precious moment of it.\n“Du
 ring the three years over which I wrote the songs on What Stays\, I though
 t constantly about memory\,” explains Malison. “How to conceive of the
  past without it\, how to preserve the present in its stead. Sometimes I w
 ould write directly about my relationship to memory\, but even when I wrot
 e about other things\, I was always looking out at the world from within t
 hat place. It colored everything.”\nFLORRY\nGram Parsons coined the phra
 se “Cosmic American Music” to describe the synthesis of country\, blue
 s\, rock and soul that he traded in. Sheridan Frances ‘Francie’ Medosc
 h wouldn’t be born for another 28 years after Parsons’ 1973 death\, bu
 t that Cosmic American sound was waiting for her all the same. On ‘Big F
 all’\, she embraces it like an old friend.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nCURSIVE\n \n Celebrating 20 Year
 s of Domestica\n \n \n \nOver the past two decades\, Cursive has become kn
 own for writing smart\, tightly woven concept albums where frontman Tim Ka
 sher turns his unflinching gaze on specific\, oftentimes challenging theme
 s\, and examines them with an incisively brutal honesty. 2000’s Domesti
 ca dealt with divorce\; 2003’s The Ugly Organ tackled art\, sex\, and
  relationships\; 2006’s Happy Hollow skewered organized religion\; 200
 9’s Mama\, I’m Swollen grappled with the human condition and social 
 morality\; and 2012’s I Am Gemini explored the battle between good and
  evil. But the band’s remarkable eighth full-length\, Vitriola\, requir
 ed a different approach — one less rigidly themed and more responsive as
  the band struggles with existentialism veering towards nihilism and despa
 ir\; the ways in which society\, much like a writer\, creates and destroys
 \; and an oncoming dystopia that feels eerily near at hand.\n \nCursive ha
 s naturally developed a pattern of releasing new music every three years\,
  creating records not out of obligation\, but need\, with the mindset that
  each record could potentially be their last. 2015 came and went\, however
 \, and the band remained silent for their longest period to date. But the 
 members of Cursive have remained busy with solo records\, a movie (the Kas
 her-penned and directed No Resolution)\, and running businesses (the band 
 collectively owns and operates hometown Omaha’s mainstay bar/venue\, O
 ’Leaver’s). The band even launched their own label\, 15 Passenger\, th
 rough which they’re steadily reissuing their remastered back catalogue\,
  as well as new albums by Kasher\, Campdogzz\, and David Bazan and Sean La
 ne. And like many others\, the band members have been caught up in the ine
 scapable state of confusion and instability that plagues their home countr
 y\, and seems to grow more chaotic with each passing day.\nTHE BIG EASY\nI
 f you need advice on how to make it through a long year\, The Big Easy has
  some tips. Founded in 2016\, The Big Easy was\, for a while at least\, th
 e solo project of singer-songwriter Stephen Berthomieux. But that was neve
 r his intention. “I’ve always had a rotating cast of musicians around 
 me\,” says Berthomieux. “The initial idea was that no matter who ﬂoa
 ted in or out around me\, The Big Easy would always be a thing.”\nWith a
  lineup ﬁnally solidiﬁed around him\, The Big Easy is now an actual ba
 nd\, and Berthomieux is using that fact to give the project a soft reboot.
  “I wanted this to be a brand new\, refreshed band. It’s not just me\,
  it’s us\,” he says\, “When I talk about The Big Easy\, I say ‘we\
 ,’ because it’s not about me anymore. The proof of that can be heard t
 hroughout A Long Year\, The Big Easy’s debut record on Forged Artifacts.

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nCHRIS PUREKA\n \nIt’s rare for 
 an artist to bridge the divide between critical acclaim and dedicated fan 
 engagement. Chris Pureka is a Portland-based singer-songwriter whose body 
 of work has resonated deeply with these seemingly disparate milieus. Her m
 usic has straddled the folk\, americana and indie rock genres over the cou
 rse of her 20 year career\, and over that time\, her bold vulnerability in
  processing the intimacies of life in song has struck a chord with those l
 isteners who crave authenticity and depth.\n \nChris’s elegant emotional
 ity as a vocalist and her flair as a lyricist have garnered her favorable 
 comparisons to Chan Marshall\, Bruce Springsteen\, and Patty Griffin. Over
  many years of touring on both sides of the Atlantic\, she has shared the 
 stage with such diverse and esteemed artists as The Lumineers\, Gregory Al
 an Isakov\, The Cowboy Junkies\, Haley Heynderickx\, and Ani DiFranco. She
  has had her songs featured on such television shows as Brothers and Siste
 rs\, Covert Affairs and Shameless and well as a song featured in the Sunda
 nce featured indie film\, The Royal Road. Along the way\, Chris has remain
 ed truly independent\, selling nearly 50\,000 albums through her own label
 \, Sad Rabbit Records.\nJOHN-ALLISON WEISSKnown for their gritty\, melodic
  indie pop songwriting\, John-Allison Weiss emerged at the end of the 2000
 s as an early crowd-funding hero with a strong D.I.Y. ethos that has defin
 ed them throughout their career. After establishing themselves among the p
 unk underground\, they became a staple of the Warped Tour and released hig
 hly rated albums like 2013’s Say What You Mean and 2015’s New Love. To
 uring with everyone from Lou Reed to Letters to Cleo\, Weiss has also coll
 aborated as a songwriter with artists including Tegan Quin and Kevin Devin
 e. Following a live album and 2021’s Death Valley Demos EP\, they signed
  with Get Better Records and issued the singles “Different Now” and

  is made up of Zach Thomas\, Justin Di Pinto\, Pat Daly\, Shane Trimble\, 
 and Tyler Yoder. Originally started as just a studio band\, it rapidly bec
 ame apparent that these songs were meant to be heard live and loud.  The 
 band made their debut in the Philly metal scene in early 2017 with success
  which was followed up by the recording of their self-titled debut in May.
  With a sound deeply rooted in modern doom metal while still giving a nod 
 to the earliest Sabbath records\, High Reeper’s first offering is driven
  by pounding rhythms\, thick guitars and soaring\, screeching vocals.  Re
 lentless touring of Europe and the US has helped the band focus their soun
 d in a more powerful direction\, driven towards a live audience. The resul
 t is a blend of classic heavy metal with riffs that are even heavier than 
 before. \nDIRTY DEALER – EP Release (10:00 PM)\n \nFormed in 2022\, Dir

  band based in Philadelphia. Forming back in 2018\, they hung together eve

  \n \n \nHaunting\, dreamy and dissonant\, Flatwaves have developed a wal
 l of sound that is equal parts shoegaze\, garage rock\, weird Americana\, 
 dark psychedelia\, and hazy doomgaze. Their music is a nod to David Lynch-
 ian dreamscapes with reverb-drenched guitars\, driving bass lines\, heavy 
 half-time breakdowns\, and cavernous vocals that fade into the abyss.\n \n
  \n \nThis is music that aims for disorientation\, just skirting the coll

 of a shapeshifter when it comes to songwriting\, and Hullabaloo finds him 
 drifting in and out of various eras while still retaining the melodic\, ho

  to the lush and thoughtful psych rock of “Into The Void\,” you can he

  – Show\nR5 Productions Presents\nMJ LENDERMAN\nJake Lenderman lives in 
 Asheville\, North Carolina. He plays guitar in the indie band Wednesday\, 
 sometimes fishes on the Pigeon River\, and creates his own music as MJ Len
 derman. His latest solo release with Dear Life Records is titled Boat Song
 s. Lenderman describes the album as his most “polished” sound to date\
 , built around songs that “chase fulfillment and happiness”—whether 
 that means buying a boat\, drinking too much\, or watching seeds fall from
  the bird feeder.\n \nBoat Songs is the followup to Lenderman’s 2021 lab
 el debut\, Ghost of Your Guitar Solo\, and subsequent release\, Knockin’
 \, with Dear Life Records\, both of which were critically acclaimed for th
 eir off-the-cuff alternative country sound. But with Boat Songs\, Lenderma
 n emerges confident as ever\, an innovative yet unassuming artist\, straig
 htforward and true.\n \nRecorded at Asheville’s Drop of Sun with Alex Fa
 rrar and Colin Miller\, Boat Songs is the first album Lenderman made in a 
 professional studio. WWE matches and basketball games were silently projec
 ted on the studio walls during recording sessions. And you can hear their 
 power in these ten unapologetically lo-fi tracks\, each brimming with pent
 -up energy and the element of surprise.\n \nA clavichord honks throughout 
 ‘You Have Bought Yourself A Boat’ with the playfulness of a live Dylan
 /Band set. ‘SUV’ screams with My Bloody Valentine distortion. When Xan
 dy Chelmis beautifully bends his steel guitar on ‘TLC Cage Match’ you 
 can’t help but think of Gram Parsons. And ‘Tastes Just Like It Costs
 ’ howls with the intensity of Crazy Horse era Neil Young. Boat Songs is 
 fearless and it’s exciting. It challenges the perception of what modern 
 day country music is supposed to be and where it can go.\n \nBut no matter
  where Boat Songs goes sonically\, the album is deeply rooted in Lenderman
 ’s natural gifts as a storyteller. Someone once asked Hank Williams what
  made country music successful and he said\, “One word: sincerity.” Fi
 lled with everyday observations ripped straight from his journal\, Lenderm
 an’s lyrics are sincere in their absurdities\, with the vulnerability an
 d honesty of Jason Molina and Daniel Johnston. There are moments of humor 
 (‘Jackass is funny like the Earth is round’)\, admission (‘I know wh
 y we get so fucked up’)\, and recognition of beauty others might not sto
 p to see (‘Your laundry looks so pretty…relaxing in the wind’). Read
  alone on the page\, ‘Hangover Game\,’ ‘You Have Bought Yourself A B
 oat\,’ and ‘Dan Marino\,’ stand out as perfect little poems\, unpret
 entious and real. Simply said\, these songs are unforgettable.\n-Ashleigh 
 Bryant Phillips\n \n\nFLORRY\nGram Parsons coined the phrase “Cosmic Ame
 rican Music” to describe the synthesis of country\, blues\, rock and sou
 l that he traded in. Sheridan Frances ‘Francie’ Medosch wouldn’t be 
 born for another 28 years after Parsons’ 1973 death\, but that Cosmic Am
 erican sound was waiting for her all the same. On ‘Big Fall’\, she emb
 races it like an old friend.\n

  – Show\nKIDS RETURN\nKids Return is first and foremost a great story of
  friendship between Adrien Rozé and Clément Savoye. It was in Paris\, at
  the age of 13\, that the two musicians met. Like Japanese director Takesh
 i Kitano’s film from which it takes its name\, the French duo’s projec
 t explores the depth within the false naivety of childhood\, and the evoca
 tive power of nostalgia when it blurs the line between joy and sadness.\n 
 \nKids Return’s sound sits somewhere between the Mamas and the Papas’ 
 Californian pop\, Vladimir Cosma’s orchestrations and the modesty of Joe
  Hisaishi’s soundtracks. It draws on Blur’s energy and MGMT’s vocal 
 harmonies\, while revisiting these Anglo-Saxon influences with the precisi
 on and delicacy of bands like Air. The result is a romantic and melancholi
 c melody\, a laboratory of emotions that can be thought of in pictures.\n 
 \nKids Return is also\, at a time when music is essentially produced on co
 mputer\, the choice of an organic\, ample and living sound. With their ana
 logical gears\, which they like to see as children’s toys\, in the manne
 r of François de Roubaix\, Clément and Adrien compose\, produce and writ
 e together. It is between their small Parisian studio and a house suspende
 d between the mountains of the Pyrenees that their pieces are born\, then 
 orchestrated by a string quartet in the countryside. From this journey eme
 rged a dreamlike and sensory music\, a call to dream\, an invitation to ex
 tract oneself from time.\n

 ing vocals paired with frontman Dara Kiely’s witty\, mundane and often s
 urrealist lyrics create ‘as perfect an expression of rock’n’roll’s
  essential auto-destructive impulse as this writers ever heard.’(The Gua
 rdian). Trailblazers for modern Irish alternative music and known for thei
 r ferocious live shows which have been described as chaotic\, electrifying
  and ‘genuinely dangerous\, like one last rave before the apocalypse’\
 , Gilla Band are not just a band\, but a force. In 2015 they signed to Rou
 gh Trade Records and let loose their debut album Holding Hands With Jamie 
 to rampant critical acclaim\, and topping this was to be no easy feat\, bu
 t following a 4 year hiatus\, they returned in September with their second
  studio album\, The Talkies\, heralded as ‘one of the biggest comebacks 
 of the year ‘ (Mary Anne Hobbs\, 6Music). The Press landscape hailed it 
 as ‘more abstract and more focused than their debut’ with outstanding 
 reviews from the likes of Crack Magazine (9/10)\,The Irish Times (5*) and 
 Record Collector(5/5). The Talkies was Recorded in November 2018 at Ballin
 tubbert House\, Ireland–the alien construction of the house and its corr
 idors help to navigate their cataclysmic sound within a world of its own. 
 And this enigmatic manor became Gilla Band’s sonic playground. It is an 
 album which is living and breathing\, in a continual state of metamorphosi

 t tie people together forever\, whether it be a place\, a song or somethin
 g you can’t quite define through words. The origins of Orions Belte stem
 med from one of those mystical moments in time\, which spawned a lasting c
 reative connection. Øyvind Blomstrøm (guitar) and Chris Holm (bass) firs
 t met while playing in a touring band for another Norwegian artist. During
  that time\, they bonded over their love for instrumental music and began 
 talking about trying their hand at it themselves. After their work as tour
 ing band ended\, they recruited drummer Kim Åge Furuhaug\, one of Holm’
 s longtime friend and collaborators\, to join their new project.\nThe thre
 e met in Bergen\, located along the west coast of Norway\, to start workin
 g on ideas and demos. Instead\, within just a few days\, they ended up rec
 ording their entire first album\, Mint. From there\, the universe propel
 led them forward\, resulting in a record deal\, their live debut as a band
  at Norway’s biggest pop festival Øyafestivalen and the release of thei
 r debut record all happening within the following year. Mint drew intern
 ational interest and praise from outlets including Atwood Magazine\, who c
 alled the record “an eclectic fusion of disparate styles and exciting so
 unds that says what it wants to say through memorable melodies\, ambient d
 rones\, and a stockpile of wicked guitar riffs.”\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \nQUASI\n \nBreaking the Balls of History 
 is Quasi’s tenth record\, landing ten years after their last record\, on
  February tenth. Three tens\, which aligns with the thirty years they’ve
  played together. Sam Coomes and Janet Weiss have become Pacific Northwest
  icons\, and Quasi has always felt so steadfast— their enduring friendsh
 ip so generative\, their energy infinite\, each album more raucous and cat
 chy and ferocious and funny than the last. But we were wrong to ever take 
 Quasi for granted. For a while\, they thought 2013’s intricate Mole City
  might be their last record. They’d go out on a great one and move on. T
 hen in August 2019 a car smashed into Janet’s and broke both legs and he
 r collarbone. Then a deadly virus collided with all of us\, and no one kne
 w when or if live music as we knew it—the touring\, the communal crowds\
 , the sonic church of the dark club—would ever happen again. “There’
 s no investing in the future anymore\,” Janet realized. “The future is
  now. Do it now if you want to do it. Don’t put it off. All those things
  you only realize when it’s almost too late. It could be gone in a secon
 d.”Under lockdown\, Portland’s streets fell still\, airplanes vanished
 \, wildlife emerged. And with the obliterated normal came an unexpected gi
 ft: uninterrupted time\, hours every day\, to make art. Quasi couldn’t g
 o on the road\, so they got an idea: they would act as if they were on tou
 r and play together every single day. Each afternoon\, Sam and Janet bunke
 red down in their tinypractice space and channeled the bewilderment and ab
 surdity of this alien new world into songs. Janet’s strength returned an
 d rose to athlete-level stamina. “When you’re younger and in a band\, 
 you make records because that’s what you do\,” Sam said. “But this t
 ime\, the whole thing felt purposeful in a way that was unique to the circ
 umstances.” They knew they would keep it to just the two of them playing
  together in a room. They knew they’d record the songs live and together
 \, to capture a moment.The incredible result of those sessions is Breaking
  the Balls of History\, recorded in five days and produced by John Goodman
 son at the legendary Robert Lang Studios in Shoreline\, WA. Here are two a
 rtists at their prime\, each a human library of musical knowledge and expe
 rience\, entirely distinctive in their songcraft and sound. In Quasi-form\
 , the band becomes alchemically even greater than the sum of its parts: Ja
 net’s galloping drums and Sam’s punk-symphonic Rocksichord and their i
 ntertwining vocals make something gigantic\, anthemic.\nBAT FANGS\n\n \nBo
 rn of a shared love of hair metal\, partying\, and the reckless spirit of 
 rock and roll\, Washington D.C./ Carborro\, NC duo Bat Fangs brings a fier
 y combination of shredderistic guitars and heavily harmonized hooks.  Gui
 tarist/vocalist Betsy Wright (Ex Hex) and drummer Laura King (Mac McCaugha
 n\, Speed Stick) united after playing a show together in their respective 
 projects\, with the goal of pushing Wright’s pop focused songwriting in 
 a bolder\, brasher direction. Taking up the primary songwriting role and s
 hifting to guitar\, Wright steps outside of the typical Ex Hex sound with 
 Bat Fangs’ rowdy rock.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nKING TUFF\n \nThere are times in 
 our life when we feel magic in the air. When new love arrives\, or we find
 ourselves lost in a moment of creation with others who share our vision. A
  sense that: this iswho I want to be. This is what I want to share.It’s 
 a fleeting feeling and one that Kyle Thomas\, the singer-songwriter who re
 cords andperforms as King Tuff\, found himself longing for in the spring o
 f 2020.But knowing he couldn’t simply recreate this time in his life at 
 will\, Thomas—who hails fromBrattleboro\, Vermont—set out to write a l
 ove letter to those cherished moments of inspirationand to the small town 
 that formed him. The one where he first nurtured his songwritingimpulses\,
  bouncing ideas off other like-minded artists. The kind of place where the
  changing ofthe seasons always delivered a sense of perspective and fresh 
 artistic inspiration. Where he felta deeper connection with nature and sen
 se of community that had once been so close at hand.\n \n“I wanted to ma
 ke an album to remind myselfthat life is magical\,” he reflects.And so\,
  Thomas seized upon his memories\, creating what he calls “an album abou
 t love andnature and youth.”The result isSmalltown Stardust\, a spiritua
 l\, tender and ultimately joyous record that mightcome as a shock to those
  with only a passing knowledge of the artist’s back catalog. OnSmalltown
  Stardust\, Thomas takes us on his journey to a place where past and prese
 nt collide\,where he can be a dreamer in love with all that he sees. Image
 s of his youth abound: fromRoute 91 which runs through his hometown (in 
 “Smalltown Stardust”)\; to Redtooth\, a spectrewho used to roam the st
 reets (“Bandits Of Blue Sky”)\; to old friends\, old haunts and old dr
 eams(“Always Find Me”)\; to Vermont’s Rock River\, which gave its na
 me toa song of a torch stillburning for past love: “Those days are gone 
 and we can’t rewind/ Cuz people grow and placeschange/ But my love for y
 ou will never fade away.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nRON GALLO\n \nHi\, my name is Ron
  Gallo\, I live on the line between two mindsets:\n1. The world is complet
 ely fucked2. The universe is inside you\nThis is my artist bio. Who has ti
 me to read this in 2022? With all that’s happening? With these attention
  spans? I know I am not cool or important — no one is — I think it’s
  a good thing. Listen to the music\, come to a show\, think for yourself. 
 The best compliment I ever received was when someone told me they can neve
 r tell when I am serious. My two biggest fears are opposites — having a 
 child or killing someone. You’re probably a little confused or annoyed\,
  but at least you’re not asleep. That’s kind of my thing. I bet you ma
 de it this far. Success!!!\nWe have all been through a lot. Especially the
  last few years but also all the years before that. There was never time t
 o collectively stop and question what has been considered “normal” for
  so long and it turns out nothing really is. These ways of thinking and do
 ing in America were never serving everyone but now they’re not serving a
 nyone (except maybe 5 guys that all look identical and own everything). So
 \, I spent an entire record trying to understand what is happening\, what
 ’s wrong with this place and what’s wrong with myself\, it’s called 
 “FOREGROUND MUSIC” and it’s going to come out on legendary label\, K
 ill Rock Stars\, on 3/3/23.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nFAKE NAMES\n \nIf credibility wer
 e currency\, Fake Names’ wealth would be off the charts. Composed ofBria
 n Baker (Minor Threat\, Bad Religion\, Dag Nasty)\, Michael Hampton (S.O.A
 .\,Embrace)\, Dennis Lyxzén (Refused\, INVSN\, The [International] Noise 
 Conspiracy)\,Johnny Temple (Girls Against Boys\, Soulside) and the newest 
 member Brendan Canty(Fugazi\, Rites of Spring)\, the band is a veritable p
 ost-hardcore dream team. Howeverinstead of rehashing the past\,Expendables
 is a reinvention that sees the band dialingback the distortion and leaning
  into the melodies. The result pairs their unparalleledpedigree with a pop
  sensibility that’s slightly unexpected and wholly satisfying. “On our
 last record [2019’sFake Names] the general influences were 70’s U.K. p
 unk and power-pop\; butit wound up with a little classic rock vibe as well
 \, like the Vibrators meetsAerosmith. We never saw that coming!” Baker e
 xplains. “The pop influences are a littlemore out front on this one and 
 the production really helps it shine. It sounds more direct\,more urgent.
 ”While the band’s debut album was actually a demo that Epitaph founder
  and Baker’s BadReligion bandmate Brett Gurewitz wanted to release as is
 \, forExpendablesthe bandenlisted producer Adam “Atom” Greenspan (IDLE
 S\, Yeah Yeah Yeahs). “On the newrecord the guitar tones are pretty clea
 n\, which is not what we normally do\, but we’re oldenough to know to gi
 ve Atom’s ideas a shot because that’s the whole point of bringingsomeo
 ne in\,” Baker explains. “Atom had me play through amps and pedals way
  out ofmy comfort zone\, but the sounds he built were perfect for the song
 s.” That sense ofcuriosity is a major thematic component ofExpendables\,
 from the chiming harmonies of“Go” to the moody melodicism of “Madtow
 n” (the latter of which could have just as easilybeen written in 1982 as
  it could in 2022). There’s also an economy to these songs that’sroote
 d in the fact that they were recorded in the span of a week\, which elimin
 ated theoption to add superfluous instrumentation or arrangements. The res
 ult is an album thatretains the members’ purity of vision in a strikingl
 y refreshing way.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nTANUKICHAN\n \nTanukichan is the 
 solo project of classically-trained Bay Area native Hannah van Loon\, whos
 e music screeched to a halt when she discovered what she affectionately ca
 lls “dad rock” in her tween years. Throughout her self described “sh
 eltered” adolescence\, van Loon taught herself guitar by spending hours 
 in front of the radio\, replicating riffs and chords from omnipresent band
 s like The Beatles and Incubus. Although van Loon is the creator and leade
 r of Tanukichan\, the project can be considered a collaboration between he
 r and the Grammy-nominated chillwave pioneer Chaz Bear of Toro y Moi. Afte
 r seeing an early Tanukichan show in 2016\, Bear expressed an interest in 
 working with van Loon\; Radio love\,Tanukichan’s first headbanger of an 
 EP\, arrived on Bear’s own Company Records that same year.The promising 
 four-song project was followed in 2018 by van Loon’s breakout debut LP\,
  Sundays\, which prompted her first solo headlining tour and dates opening
  for artists like Kero Kero Bonito and The Drums. Sundays earned Tanukicha
 n enthusiastic critical acclaim\, with Pitchfork writing that it “captur
 es the spirit of a day whose wide-open nature fosters anxieties as well as
  ambitions” and Rolling Stone lauding its “bruising riffs\, taut groov
 es\, and open-road-ready guitar anthems.” Tanukichan’s sophomore album
  GIZMO is out on March 3rd\, 2023. While still rooted in the eerie shoegaz
 e she’s become known and loved for\, it also sees her go beyond her comf
 ort zone\, incorporating elements of grunge\, industrial synths\, nu metal
  basslines\, and electric guitars that culminate into a captivating wall-o
 f-sound. The result is her most fun-sounding work yet.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nWESTERMAN\n \nUK artist Westerman
  returns with his first offering in two years with the song “Idol\; RE-r
 un” out via Partisan Records. The new track\,produced by James Krivcheni
 a and Westerman\,juxtaposes gentle and celestial sonics with an aggrieved 
 disposition and features artwork by renownedNew York via Portugal Graphic 
 Designer and Illustrator Bráulio Amado. The song was written after Wester
 man emergedfrom a period of disenchantment with making music\, and with th
 e future of his career feeling abstract\, it seemed unclear to Westerman w
 hether the material he was recording would ever be heard. Creatively\, thi
 s offered a strange kind of freedom\, and accommodated some of the most ad
 venturous and unselfconscious songwriting of his career. Finding textures 
 became a central concern taking programming and looping into his own hands
  in a way he never had before\, creating polyrhythmic grooves to lend urge
 ncy to his inner dialogue.”Idol\; RE-run” is the first taste of songs 
 written in this period and provides a hint for what’s to come from Weste
 rman in the coming year. The track featuresJames Krivchenia\, Mikel Patric
 k Avery and Booker Stardrum on drums\, Ben Reed on bass\, Luke Temple on s
 ynth\, Mat Davidson on piano\, Robin Eubanks on the trombone and of course
  Westerman on vocals\, guitar and synth.Speaking about the new song\, West
 erman shares:”The lyrics to the song were written around the same time a
 s the storming of the Capitol. The compulsion towards the pedestal is stro
 ng. The need to scapegoat and revere without logic. Our populists actively
  celebrate their being people who don’t know anything other or better th
 an anyone else\, yet these spectres with their failings conduct our anger 
 and resentment as if they were gods. They are nothing more than the shadow
  of something else\, the face fronting a need to be loved or revered prese
 nt in everyone. And there will always be another face to front.”\n
