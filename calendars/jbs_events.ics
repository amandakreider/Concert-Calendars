  feeble little horse is a 4-piece band that writes intricately catchy\, di
 gitized noise pop songs. Formed by Sebastian Kinsler (guitar\, production\
 , vocals\, bass) and Ryan Walchonski (guitar\, vocals) in Ryan’s student
  apartment in South Oakland\, PA in February 2021\, the duo soon added Rya
 n’s roommate Jake Kelley on drums\, and\, inspired by a wave of creativi
 ty\, the trio released their first EP – modern tourism\, in May 2021\, 
 with artwork contributed by future member Lydia Slocum (vocals\, bass).Aft
 er officially joining the band in June of that year as bassist and vocalis
 t\, Lydia added her own sweet vocals\, rich melodies\, and punchy lyrics t
 o the band’s heady mix. From summer to fall of that year\, the quartet p
 layed their first shows at DIY establishments across Pittsburgh and Philad
 elphia\, gaining a word-of-mouth reputation as one of the most exciting ne
 w bands on the scene.In October 2021 feeble little horse released their fi
 rst full-length album\, Hayday\, via Julia’s War Recordings. Full of den
 se textures and exhilarating tension\, the album’s eleven songs bristle 
 with pent-up energy\, the mood flipping between sweet noise-pop elements a
 nd more visceral discharges\, the whole thing balanced on a knife-edge bet
 ween the light and dark\, the earnest and unhinged.\n \n \n \nMerce Lemon

  is made up of Zach Thomas\, Justin Di Pinto\, Pat Daly\, Shane Trimble\, 
 and Tyler Yoder. Originally started as just a studio band\, it rapidly bec
 ame apparent that these songs were meant to be heard live and loud.  The 
 band made their debut in the Philly metal scene in early 2017 with success
  which was followed up by the recording of their self-titled debut in May.
  With a sound deeply rooted in modern doom metal while still giving a nod 
 to the earliest Sabbath records\, High Reeper’s first offering is driven
  by pounding rhythms\, thick guitars and soaring\, screeching vocals.  Re
 lentless touring of Europe and the US has helped the band focus their soun

 t is a blend of classic heavy metal with riffs that are even heavier than 
 before. \nDIRTY DEALER – EP Release (10:00 PM)\n \nFormed in 2022\, Dir

 half-time breakdowns\, and cavernous vocals that fade into the abyss.\n \n

 ors8PM – Show\nCROOKS & NANNIES (EP RELEASE)\n \nCrooks & Nannies is a c
 ollaboration between multi-instrumentalists and friends since high school.
  Their signature blend of brash\, confessional indie rock functions on ext
 remes. Alternating between painfully tender and jarringly obtuse\, the chi
 ldhood friends fashion themes of growth\, loss\, and transformation into o
 ff-kilter pop songs that whirr with the unpredictability of a failing engi
 ne. Thematically\, their songs tackle experiences with gender dysphoria\, 
 transitioning\, anxiety\, and finding a place as a 20-something in a world
  that feels utterly hostile. That search spills over into the music\, too\
 , a playground where each song’s center of gravity seems unpredictable a
 nd fluid. Musically the duo slams against the contours of modern emo & 90s
  college rock\, toying with tropes of country songwriting while threading 
 through elements of electronic music & avant-pop. In less capable hands\, 
 the amalgam could be dizzying. Here\, Rafter & Huntington are in complete 
 control.\nEMPATH\n \nEmpath goes far beyond the sound of birds faintly ch
 irping. They’re a band that writes songs like communing with nature\, br
 inging all their fuzzed and tripped out idiosyncrasies into harmony. Empat
 h began in 2016 when Garrett Koloski\, Emily “Jem” Shanahan\, and C
 atherine Elicson moved into a house in West Philadelphia together. Even 
 with the simple vision to shred\, there’s a natural sensitivity in the w
 ay Empath communicates. Between the contrast of Elicson’s lush\, almost 
 delicate vocals\, Koloski’s boisterous drumming\, and the half-harmoniou
 s wash of guitar and Shanahan’s synths\, Empath equips us with a healthy
  dose of emotional repose.\n \n \n \nANOTHER MICHAEL\n \nFor Another Mich
 ael\, it all boils down to trust. In mid-2017\, the critically acclaimed i
 ndie three-piece packed their bags and collectively relocated from Albany\
 , NY to a shared house in West Philadelphia. This move signaled not only t
 he start of a new chapter for the trio\, but also a deepening of the bonds
  that would come to define their captivating debut LP\, ‘New Music and B
 ig Pop.’\n

 of a shapeshifter when it comes to songwriting\, and Hullabaloo finds him 
 drifting in and out of various eras while still retaining the melodic\, ho
 ok-driven sound his fans have come to expect. From the frantic title track
  to the lush and thoughtful psych rock of “Into The Void\,” you can he
 ar traces of 60s folk\, early Bowie\, grunge and even unabashed pop (“Pr
 otein”). His music has been featured on playlists such as Spotify’s 
 “Alternarock”\, “Fresh Folk”\, Apple’s “New In Indie”\, “P
 eak Indie” and “Breaking Rock”. \n \nHullabaloo” was produced by 
 Cortez and Shane Woods (Mo Lowda) at Headroom Studios (Alex G\, Hop Along\

 eo League is driven by the songwriting of childhood friends Alex Savoth an
 d Dan King. Initially a studio project formed with the help of Engineer an
 d Producer Eric Bogacz\, the three began crafting songs and recruiting a c
 ast of friends to fill in the gaps. Pretty soon\, The League had grown to 
 a dozen members and the result was their debut album “A Light on Each Si
 de”. Often appearing live as a six-piece band\, the group has incorporat
 ed influences from a plethora of genres\, both modern and classic\, refusi
 ng to be boxed in by conventional labels. The outcome is an ever-changing 
 musical landscape that continues to evolve along with their line-up.\nOn t
 heir latest EP Endless Mirage\, Savoth and King collaborated with the Synt
 h & Soul record label and production crew Eraserhood Sound. The result is 
 a timeless\, shimmering collection of songs that tell evocative tales of l
 oneliness and longing\, set against the backdrop of Eraserhood Sound’s s
 ignature analog production. Stereo League\, who was previously named Artis
 t to Watch by Philadelphia’s WXPN\, believes this release to be the clea
 rest and best representation of their vision to date— delivering the sou
 lful sound they have been searching for.\n \n \n \nThe collaboration with
  Eraserhood Sound continued in the fall of 2022 with two additional single
 s. “Seasons of Trouble” and “Operator\, Please” were released on t
 heir second 45 and feature vocal performances by Turquoise Cobb who joined
  the band’s line-up late in 2021. After some time on the road with ATO a

 eventful 2023. \n \n\nAJAY (9:00 PM)\nSinger\, songwriter\, and multi-ins
 trumentalist\, AJAY\, encompasses the vast\, experimental nature of modern
  sound design with the soul-drenched ingredients that defined Philadelphia
  for decades. The self-produced artist’s vulnerable falsetto vocals brin

  While acting as touring guitarist/bassist to Alternative R&B artist\, Ori
 on Sun\, as well as performing with local supergroup\, Omar’s Hat\, AJAY
  has been able to create and expand upon his own unique perspective.\nMOUS
 TAPHA NOUMBISSI (8:00 PM)\nMoustapha Noumbissi is a songwriter/multi-instr
 umentalist based in Philadelphia\, PA. Born in Belgium to Cameroonian pare
 nts\, Moustapha grew up a participant of many musical traditions including
 –West African drumming\, American pop\, and choral music–his latest re
 cordings favor Indie Rock and Psychedelic Soul. His recent work with produ
 cer Lee Clarke is testimony to liminality\, self-definition and simultaneo
 us reverence for and refusal of genre.\n

 Asheville\, North Carolina. He plays guitar in the indie band Wednesday\, 
 sometimes fishes on the Pigeon River\, and creates his own music as MJ Len
 derman. His latest solo release with Dear Life Records is titled Boat Song
 s. Lenderman describes the album as his most “polished” sound to date\
 , built around songs that “chase fulfillment and happiness”—whether 
 that means buying a boat\, drinking too much\, or watching seeds fall from
  the bird feeder.\n \nBoat Songs is the followup to Lenderman’s 2021 lab
 el debut\, Ghost of Your Guitar Solo\, and subsequent release\, Knockin’
 \, with Dear Life Records\, both of which were critically acclaimed for th
 eir off-the-cuff alternative country sound. But with Boat Songs\, Lenderma
 n emerges confident as ever\, an innovative yet unassuming artist\, straig
 htforward and true.\n \nRecorded at Asheville’s Drop of Sun with Alex Fa
 rrar and Colin Miller\, Boat Songs is the first album Lenderman made in a 
 professional studio. WWE matches and basketball games were silently projec
 ted on the studio walls during recording sessions. And you can hear their 
 power in these ten unapologetically lo-fi tracks\, each brimming with pent
 -up energy and the element of surprise.\n \nA clavichord honks throughout 
 ‘You Have Bought Yourself A Boat’ with the playfulness of a live Dylan
 /Band set. ‘SUV’ screams with My Bloody Valentine distortion. When Xan
 dy Chelmis beautifully bends his steel guitar on ‘TLC Cage Match’ you 
 can’t help but think of Gram Parsons. And ‘Tastes Just Like It Costs
 ’ howls with the intensity of Crazy Horse era Neil Young. Boat Songs is 
 fearless and it’s exciting. It challenges the perception of what modern 
 day country music is supposed to be and where it can go.\n-Ashleigh Bryant

  – Show\nKIDS RETURN\nKids Return is first and foremost a great story of
  friendship between Adrien Rozé and Clément Savoye. It was in Paris\, at
  the age of 13\, that the two musicians met. Like Japanese director Takesh
 i Kitano’s film from which it takes its name\, the French duo’s projec
 t explores the depth within the false naivety of childhood\, and the evoca
 tive power of nostalgia when it blurs the line between joy and sadness.\n 
 \nKids Return’s sound sits somewhere between the Mamas and the Papas’ 
 Californian pop\, Vladimir Cosma’s orchestrations and the modesty of Joe
  Hisaishi’s soundtracks. It draws on Blur’s energy and MGMT’s vocal 
 harmonies\, while revisiting these Anglo-Saxon influences with the precisi
 on and delicacy of bands like Air. The result is a romantic and melancholi
 c melody\, a laboratory of emotions that can be thought of in pictures.\n 
 \nKids Return is also\, at a time when music is essentially produced on co
 mputer\, the choice of an organic\, ample and living sound. With their ana
 logical gears\, which they like to see as children’s toys\, in the manne
 r of François de Roubaix\, Clément and Adrien compose\, produce and writ
 e together. It is between their small Parisian studio and a house suspende
 d between the mountains of the Pyrenees that their pieces are born\, then 
 orchestrated by a string quartet in the countryside. From this journey eme
 rged a dreamlike and sensory music\, a call to dream\, an invitation to ex
 tract oneself from time.\n

 to A Flock Of Seagulls\, Duran Duran\, and Glass Animals. Formed in 2014 b
 y Jeff Familetti (vocals\, keys\, guitar) and Ryan Bayler (keys\, guitar) 
 as a synth pop duo\, the band recently went through some dramatic changes 
 with the addition of two new members\, Joe Tockett (Drums) and Cameron Kyn
 ett (Bass).  As a result\, the group’s sound has blossomed\, a shift th
 at has garnered local attention and resulted in a feature as one of WXPN
 ’s Local Picks\, as well as a prime spot on the lineup for 2nd Street Fe
 stival. The group is currently in the process of recording their third EP\
 , “Repercussions.”  Their first two EPs\, “Repetitions”  and “
 Reflections\,” were recorded at Headroom Studios by Mark Watter and are 
 currently available for streaming online.  \n \nSTATIC SHAPES (9:00 PM)\n
 Long-time fixtures of the Philadelphia indie rock scene\, singer/guitarist
  Steve Yutzy-Burkey (The Swimmers)\, drummer Mike Kennedy (Audible\, Lefty
 ’s Deceiver)\, bassist Rick Sieber (The Swimmers)\, and keyboard player 
 Alex Yaker (Roomtone) formed Static Shapes in 2019 around a loose collecti
 on of songs that envisioned their Philadelphia riverside neighborhood grad
 ually drifting out to sea. The band dug deep into the limitations of 2020 
 to painstakingly record the sprawling lockdown sounds of the self-produced
  Give Me The Bad News\, which featured on numerous year-end best-of lists\
 , including the San Diego Union-Tribune’s.  Facing another blurring and
  uncertain year\, Kennedy became immersed in William Basinski’s classic 
 The Disintegration Loops as inspiration for a series of glitchy\, 4-track 
 cassette loops that evoked this heavy sense of disruption and loss.  Yutz
 y-Burkey layered melodies over the loops\, drawing from the constant echoe
 s of history encountered in his work restoring pipe organs and renovating 
 Philadelphia’s crumbling buildings.  Merging this backdrop with dreams 
 of an eerily altered future\, the 5-song Blursday EP continues Static Shap
 es’ probing of the limits of home studio production. Dream-pop synths an
 d warbling guitar hooks float over skittering bass and drums\, while shimm
 ers of those original tape loops occasionally rise to the surface.\nSOLD (

 ing vocals paired with frontman Dara Kiely’s witty\, mundane and often s
 urrealist lyrics create ‘as perfect an expression of rock’n’roll’s

 r ferocious live shows which have been described as chaotic\, electrifying
  and ‘genuinely dangerous\, like one last rave before the apocalypse’\
 , Gilla Band are not just a band\, but a force. In 2015 they signed to Rou

 to rampant critical acclaim\, and topping this was to be no easy feat\, bu
 t following a 4 year hiatus\, they returned in September with their second
  studio album\, The Talkies\, heralded as ‘one of the biggest comebacks 
 of the year ‘ (Mary Anne Hobbs\, 6Music). The Press landscape hailed it 
 as ‘more abstract and more focused than their debut’ with outstanding 
 reviews from the likes of Crack Magazine (9/10)\,The Irish Times (5*) and 
 Record Collector(5/5). The Talkies was Recorded in November 2018 at Ballin
 tubbert House\, Ireland–the alien construction of the house and its corr
 idors help to navigate their cataclysmic sound within a world of its own. 
 And this enigmatic manor became Gilla Band’s sonic playground. It is an 
 album which is living and breathing\, in a continual state of metamorphosi

 hris Holm (bass) first met while playing in a touring band for another Nor
 wegian artist. During that time\, they bonded over their love for instrume

 re\, the universe propelled them forward\, resulting in a record deal\, th
 eir live debut as a band at Norway’s biggest pop festival Øyafestivalen
  and the release of their debut record all happening within the following 
 year. Mint drew international interest and praise from outlets including

 oneers of the Belfast Punk Movement. Signed to the now legendary Good Vibr
 ations label\, their debut release Don’t Ring Me Up received excellent r
 eviews and enjoyed widespread airplay on Radio 1. They quickly came to the
  attention of Rough Trade Records\, who re-released the track to wide accl
 aim. This in turn led to the band signing for Polydor Records\, who releas
 ed the single I Can’t Cope\, followed by I Can Only Dream.\n1979 saw the
  band take to the road with the Boomtown Rats before embarking on two exte
 nsive tours of their own throughout the US and Canada in the early ‘80s.
  An album was recorded with legendary producer Chas Chandler\, who’d wor
 ked with\, among others\, Hendrix\, The Animals and Slade. However\, the b
 and weren’t happy with the result and after a final release\, A Place in
  Your Heart\, the band and label parted ways\, Protex splitting soon after
 .\nFast Forward to 2010\, when New York’s Sing Sing Records located the 
 Polydor recordings and released the album Strange Obsessions on vinyl\, ig
 niting renewed interest in the band.\nFounders Aidan Murtagh and Dave McMa
 ster reformed the band and shows followed across Europe before the band we
 re invited to tour Japan. Protex continued to tour intensively and in 2014
  were invited to play the prestigious South by Southwest festival in Austi
 n\, Texas. They returned the following year and have become regulars at th
 e festival\, often playing there as part of larger US tours. In 2016 Prote
 x concentrated on completing the album Tightrope and signed to Bachelor Re
 cords. Tightrope was released in early 2017\, before the band returned to 
 the USA with a tour that began with a sold-out New York show and finished 
 with a festival appearance in San Antonio.\nWith touring on hold during th
 e pandemic\, the band concentrated on recording a new album Wicked Ways\, 
 released on Bachelor Records in August this year. And with tours already c
 oming together for Europe and the US\, 2023 is already looking like anothe
 r busy year for Protex.\n \n \n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \nQUASI\n \nBreaking the Balls of History 
 is Quasi’s tenth record\, landing ten years after their last record\, on
  February tenth. Three tens\, which aligns with the thirty years they’ve
  played together. Sam Coomes and Janet Weiss have become Pacific Northwest
  icons\, and Quasi has always felt so steadfast— their enduring friendsh
 ip so generative\, their energy infinite\, each album more raucous and cat
 chy and ferocious and funny than the last. But we were wrong to ever take 
 Quasi for granted. For a while\, they thought 2013’s intricate Mole City
  might be their last record. They’d go out on a great one and move on. T
 hen in August 2019 a car smashed into Janet’s and broke both legs and he
 r collarbone. Then a deadly virus collided with all of us\, and no one kne
 w when or if live music as we knew it—the touring\, the communal crowds\
 , the sonic church of the dark club—would ever happen again. “There’
 s no investing in the future anymore\,” Janet realized. “The future is
  now. Do it now if you want to do it. Don’t put it off. All those things
  you only realize when it’s almost too late. It could be gone in a secon
 d.”Under lockdown\, Portland’s streets fell still\, airplanes vanished
 \, wildlife emerged. And with the obliterated normal came an unexpected gi
 ft: uninterrupted time\, hours every day\, to make art. Quasi couldn’t g
 o on the road\, so they got an idea: they would act as if they were on tou
 r and play together every single day. Each afternoon\, Sam and Janet bunke
 red down in their tinypractice space and channeled the bewilderment and ab
 surdity of this alien new world into songs. Janet’s strength returned an
 d rose to athlete-level stamina. “When you’re younger and in a band\, 
 you make records because that’s what you do\,” Sam said. “But this t
 ime\, the whole thing felt purposeful in a way that was unique to the circ
 umstances.” They knew they would keep it to just the two of them playing
  together in a room. They knew they’d record the songs live and together
 \, to capture a moment.The incredible result of those sessions is Breaking
  the Balls of History\, recorded in five days and produced by John Goodman
 son at the legendary Robert Lang Studios in Shoreline\, WA. Here are two a
 rtists at their prime\, each a human library of musical knowledge and expe
 rience\, entirely distinctive in their songcraft and sound. In Quasi-form\
 , the band becomes alchemically even greater than the sum of its parts: Ja
 net’s galloping drums and Sam’s punk-symphonic Rocksichord and their i
 ntertwining vocals make something gigantic\, anthemic.\nBAT FANGS\n\n \nBo
 rn of a shared love of hair metal\, partying\, and the reckless spirit of 
 rock and roll\, Washington D.C./ Carborro\, NC duo Bat Fangs brings a fier
 y combination of shredderistic guitars and heavily harmonized hooks.  Gui
 tarist/vocalist Betsy Wright (Ex Hex) and drummer Laura King (Mac McCaugha
 n\, Speed Stick) united after playing a show together in their respective 
 projects\, with the goal of pushing Wright’s pop focused songwriting in 
 a bolder\, brasher direction. Taking up the primary songwriting role and s
 hifting to guitar\, Wright steps outside of the typical Ex Hex sound with 
 Bat Fangs’ rowdy rock.\n

  – Show\nTHE MESSTHETICS\n \nThe last time drummer Brendan Canty and bas
 sist Joe Lally were in a band together\, they were the rhythmic architects
  for Fugazi\, an organization whose decade and a half of disciplined progr
 essivism provided a necessary bridge between the zenith of late-punk expre
 ssion and everything alternative in rock that followed. In 2016\, the two 
 were enlisted by guitarist Anthony Pirog in a conspiracy to subvert and re
 imagine the power trio\, bringing fully into the 21st Century a form that 
 may have reached near perfection with Hendrix’s Band of Gypsys on the ve
 ry first day of the 1970s.\nWith a self-titled recording scheduled for rel
 ease in the Spring of 2018 on Dischord\, the Messthetics will widen the re
 ach of a decisive instrumental music that so far\, they have only shared w
 ith a privileged handful of east coast and southern audiences. Across its 
 eight original compositions and one cover\, Anthony guides the sound throu
 gh complex changes and harmonic densities that might compound\, but never 
 confound or muddy its connection with the listener’s body. Recorded by B
 rendan in their practice space\, the group’s debut gives Anthony ample o
 pportunities to swap guitar textures and styles as freely as an octopus ch
 anges patterns.\n \n— Dr. Thomas Stanley (aka Bushmeat Sound)\nJAMES BRA
 NDON LEWIS TRIO\nI would think James would have a personal reference for s
 uch a title as Eye of I\, the poetic ululation of the trio of words\, not 
 unlike the sound of this particular human trio of music messengers. To my 
 mind\, Eye of I is in reference to a focus\, and a focus which is not enti
 rely disciplinarian but one infused with the spiritual. Having played a ti
 ny bit with James at a loose session some years back\, I felt the sound of
  meditation\, prayer\, and thoughtfulness in both a search and an acceptan
 ce of vibratory creative impulse. We just went into an elemental wave of s
 onics as a free thought recognition of peace and bliss in concordance with
  all the wild conflict this universe has in both its real world and dreams
 cape. The music went outside of any physical construct of time\, space and
  judgment\, feeling perfectly imperfect as a cosmologic unification of ope
 n-hearted love.\nJames’ compositions are at once the sole realizations o
 f his own “living music” concepts\, the aura of actually “seeing” 
 the music as it is conjured and gifted from the composer’s mind\, spirit
 \, and body\, as well as being defined to a profound degree by the interac
 tion of players James finds himself compatriot to. The JBL Trio on Eye Of 
 I is James on tenor\, cellist Christopher Hoffman and percussionist Max Ja
 ffe—augmented on two tracks by the guest appearance of cornetist Kirk Kn
 uffke\, and joined on a third by Anthony Pirog\, Brendan Canty. and Joe La
 lly of The Messthetics—players who have been on the scene\, and who are 
 obviously in the mix for JBL as these serious soul serenaders are not afra
 id to dig in hard to the dynamics being proffered\, always allowing a soph
 istication to present a sentient\, sometimes placid (with youngblood rambu
 nction\, underlying and playful) groove\, a groove dealing with intellect 
 as natural guidance—music reflecting the masters and finding its own com
 munitarian grace.\n— Thurston Moore\, 2022 London\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nKING TUFF\n \nThere are times in 
 our life when we feel magic in the air. When new love arrives\, or we find
 ourselves lost in a moment of creation with others who share our vision. A
  sense that: this iswho I want to be. This is what I want to share.It’s 
 a fleeting feeling and one that Kyle Thomas\, the singer-songwriter who re
 cords andperforms as King Tuff\, found himself longing for in the spring o
 f 2020.But knowing he couldn’t simply recreate this time in his life at 
 will\, Thomas—who hails fromBrattleboro\, Vermont—set out to write a l
 ove letter to those cherished moments of inspirationand to the small town 
 that formed him. The one where he first nurtured his songwritingimpulses\,
  bouncing ideas off other like-minded artists. The kind of place where the
  changing ofthe seasons always delivered a sense of perspective and fresh 
 artistic inspiration. Where he felta deeper connection with nature and sen
 se of community that had once been so close at hand.\n \n“I wanted to ma
 ke an album to remind myselfthat life is magical\,” he reflects.And so\,
  Thomas seized upon his memories\, creating what he calls “an album abou
 t love andnature and youth.”The result isSmalltown Stardust\, a spiritua
 l\, tender and ultimately joyous record that mightcome as a shock to those
  with only a passing knowledge of the artist’s back catalog. OnSmalltown
  Stardust\, Thomas takes us on his journey to a place where past and prese
 nt collide\,where he can be a dreamer in love with all that he sees. Image
 s of his youth abound: fromRoute 91 which runs through his hometown (in 
 “Smalltown Stardust”)\; to Redtooth\, a spectrewho used to roam the st
 reets (“Bandits Of Blue Sky”)\; to old friends\, old haunts and old dr
 eams(“Always Find Me”)\; to Vermont’s Rock River\, which gave its na
 me toa song of a torch stillburning for past love: “Those days are gone 
 and we can’t rewind/ Cuz people grow and placeschange/ But my love for y
 ou will never fade away.\nTCHOTCHKE\nNew York-based trio\, Tchotchke relea
 ses the ‘50s-inspired music video for their single “Wish You Were a Gi
 rl” following the release of their self-titled debut album. The video\, 
 which stars band members Anastasia\, Eva\, and Emily as distraught runaway
 -brides and housewives\, is a statement on rejecting traditional feminine 
 ideologies. “The entire video plays with this fictitious smokey dollhous
 e world where the band runs away from all feminine responsibilities and fo
 rced ideologies\,” director Ambar Navarro shares.  Throughout “Wish Y
 ou Were a Girl\,” we see the trio trapped within the confines of heteron
 ormativity\, and as it progresses\, we see them grow increasingly frustrat
 ed\, leading to their eventual escape from these age-old ideologies. \n

  – Show\nCharlotte Adigéry & Bolis Pupul\nCultural appropriation and ra
 cism. Social media vanity. Post-colonialism and political correctness. The
 se are not talking points that you’d ordinarily hear on the dancefloor b
 ut Charlotte Adigéry and Bolis Pupul are ripping up the rulebook with the
 ir debut album Topical Dancer. The Ghent-based duo\, who broke out with th
 eir 2019 Zandoli EP on Soulwax’s record label DEEWEE\, are rare storytel
 lers in electronic music: they take the temperature of the time and funnel
  them into their playful synth concoctions – never didactic and always w
 ith a knowing wink.\nTheir new studio record – which cements them as a d
 uo under both their names for the first time and is co-written and co-prod
 uced by Soulwax – is both a triumph of kaleidoscopic electro-pop and “
 a snapshot of how we think about pop culture in the 2020s.” It captures 
 Charlotte and Bolis’s essence as musical collaborators and the conversat
 ions they’ve had over the past two years on tour\, as well as their pers
 pectives as Belgians with an immigrant background\, Charlotte with Guadelo
 upean and French-Martinique ancestry and Bolis being of Chinese descent.\n
 Conceptually\, the pair wanted to put these observations and ideas about c
 ulture today and the zeitgeist into a “time capsule shaped like an egg
 ”\, with the idea that you could “bury the album somewhere”\, says B
 olis\, for future generations to find and figure out what the 2020s were a
 ll about through their eyes. The egg is “a visual shorthand\,” they sa
 y\, “for new life and unhatched potential.”\nZandoli was partly an exp
 loration of what it means to be a woman of Caribbean heritage growing up i
 n Belgium – Pitchfork called it “striking\, playful electro pop with a
  sly sense of humour”. Topical Dancer\, however\, expands their worldvie
 w outwards. Songs like “Hey” question the shallowness of ‘wokeness
 ’ and searches for a utopia of “equality\, harmony and integrity”\, 
 while ‘Reappropriate’ is a fluttery R&B-ish song about liberating ones
 elf from sexual trauma. Charlotte sings across English\, Dutch\, Creole an
 d French\, her signature deadpan delivery at times recalling a vogue house
  vocalist or a Black Mirror-style virtual assistant\, giving the album a h
 ypnotic\, fourth-world quality.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nFAKE NAMES\n \nIf credibility wer
 e currency\, Fake Names’ wealth would be off the charts. Composed ofBria
 n Baker (Minor Threat\, Bad Religion\, Dag Nasty)\, Michael Hampton (S.O.A
 .\,Embrace)\, Dennis Lyxzén (Refused\, INVSN\, The [International] Noise 
 Conspiracy)\,Johnny Temple (Girls Against Boys\, Soulside) and the newest 
 member Brendan Canty(Fugazi\, Rites of Spring)\, the band is a veritable p
 ost-hardcore dream team. Howeverinstead of rehashing the past\,Expendables
 is a reinvention that sees the band dialingback the distortion and leaning
  into the melodies. The result pairs their unparalleledpedigree with a pop
  sensibility that’s slightly unexpected and wholly satisfying. “On our
 last record [2019’sFake Names] the general influences were 70’s U.K. p
 unk and power-pop\; butit wound up with a little classic rock vibe as well
 \, like the Vibrators meetsAerosmith. We never saw that coming!” Baker e
 xplains. “The pop influences are a littlemore out front on this one and 
 the production really helps it shine. It sounds more direct\,more urgent.
 ”While the band’s debut album was actually a demo that Epitaph founder
  and Baker’s BadReligion bandmate Brett Gurewitz wanted to release as is
 \, forExpendablesthe bandenlisted producer Adam “Atom” Greenspan (IDLE
 S\, Yeah Yeah Yeahs). “On the newrecord the guitar tones are pretty clea
 n\, which is not what we normally do\, but we’re oldenough to know to gi
 ve Atom’s ideas a shot because that’s the whole point of bringingsomeo
 ne in\,” Baker explains. “Atom had me play through amps and pedals way
  out ofmy comfort zone\, but the sounds he built were perfect for the song
 s.” That sense ofcuriosity is a major thematic component ofExpendables\,
 from the chiming harmonies of“Go” to the moody melodicism of “Madtow
 n” (the latter of which could have just as easilybeen written in 1982 as
  it could in 2022). There’s also an economy to these songs that’sroote
 d in the fact that they were recorded in the span of a week\, which elimin
 ated theoption to add superfluous instrumentation or arrangements. The res
 ult is an album thatretains the members’ purity of vision in a strikingl
 y refreshing way.\n

  in the mounting tension of the washed guitars in LP2’s opening track 
 “D.” The cyclical echoes are forced into a linear crescendo as the ful

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nTANUKICHAN\n \nTanukichan is the 
 solo project of classically-trained Bay Area native Hannah van Loon\, whos
 e music screeched to a halt when she discovered what she affectionately ca
 lls “dad rock” in her tween years. Throughout her self described “sh
 eltered” adolescence\, van Loon taught herself guitar by spending hours 
 in front of the radio\, replicating riffs and chords from omnipresent band
 s like The Beatles and Incubus. Although van Loon is the creator and leade
 r of Tanukichan\, the project can be considered a collaboration between he
 r and the Grammy-nominated chillwave pioneer Chaz Bear of Toro y Moi. Afte
 r seeing an early Tanukichan show in 2016\, Bear expressed an interest in 
 working with van Loon\; Radio love\,Tanukichan’s first headbanger of an 
 EP\, arrived on Bear’s own Company Records that same year.The promising 
 four-song project was followed in 2018 by van Loon’s breakout debut LP\,
  Sundays\, which prompted her first solo headlining tour and dates opening
  for artists like Kero Kero Bonito and The Drums. Sundays earned Tanukicha
 n enthusiastic critical acclaim\, with Pitchfork writing that it “captur
 es the spirit of a day whose wide-open nature fosters anxieties as well as
  ambitions” and Rolling Stone lauding its “bruising riffs\, taut groov
 es\, and open-road-ready guitar anthems.” Tanukichan’s sophomore album
  GIZMO is out on March 3rd\, 2023. While still rooted in the eerie shoegaz
 e she’s become known and loved for\, it also sees her go beyond her comf
 ort zone\, incorporating elements of grunge\, industrial synths\, nu metal
  basslines\, and electric guitars that culminate into a captivating wall-o
 f-sound. The result is her most fun-sounding work yet.\nWINTERWhat Kind of
  Blue Are You?\, Winter’s sophomore release with Bar/None Records\, is a
 n emotional excavation of Samira Winter’s purest self.\nMusically\, the 
 LP’s 10 songs reconnect with the earliest incarnation of Winter\, once a
 gain painting with brushstrokes of distorted guitar\, but using them to fu
 el a wiser\, more mature form of sonic liberation. Whereas 2020’s Endle
 ss Space (Between You and I) was steeped in fairytale surrealism and spri
 nglike grace\, her latest offering is crystalline and spartan\, songs stri
 pped to their inner blue core\, Winter’s smoldering shadow self.\nIt’s
  another stunning work in a canon that’s established her as one of Los A
 ngeles’ most enduring\, consistently-head-turning dream poppers\, the me
 lancholy and bittersweet beauty that’s been with her throughout Winter
 ’s existence now pushed to center stage. Strengthened by her ever-increa
 sing powers as a songwriter\, she confronts painful wounds of trauma and d
 espair for the first time on record\, and achieves some semblance of peace
  and healing in the process.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nWESTERMAN\n \nUK artist Westerman
  returns with his first offering in two years with the song “Idol\; RE-r
 un” out via Partisan Records. The new track\,produced by James Krivcheni
 a and Westerman\,juxtaposes gentle and celestial sonics with an aggrieved 
 disposition and features artwork by renownedNew York via Portugal Graphic 
 Designer and Illustrator Bráulio Amado. The song was written after Wester
 man emergedfrom a period of disenchantment with making music\, and with th
 e future of his career feeling abstract\, it seemed unclear to Westerman w
 hether the material he was recording would ever be heard. Creatively\, thi
 s offered a strange kind of freedom\, and accommodated some of the most ad
 venturous and unselfconscious songwriting of his career. Finding textures 
 became a central concern taking programming and looping into his own hands
  in a way he never had before\, creating polyrhythmic grooves to lend urge
 ncy to his inner dialogue.”Idol\; RE-run” is the first taste of songs 
 written in this period and provides a hint for what’s to come from Weste
 rman in the coming year. The track featuresJames Krivchenia\, Mikel Patric
 k Avery and Booker Stardrum on drums\, Ben Reed on bass\, Luke Temple on s
 ynth\, Mat Davidson on piano\, Robin Eubanks on the trombone and of course
  Westerman on vocals\, guitar and synth.Speaking about the new song\, West
 erman shares:”The lyrics to the song were written around the same time a
 s the storming of the Capitol. The compulsion towards the pedestal is stro
 ng. The need to scapegoat and revere without logic. Our populists actively
  celebrate their being people who don’t know anything other or better th
 an anyone else\, yet these spectres with their failings conduct our anger 
 and resentment as if they were gods. They are nothing more than the shadow
  of something else\, the face fronting a need to be loved or revered prese
 nt in everyone. And there will always be another face to front.”\n
