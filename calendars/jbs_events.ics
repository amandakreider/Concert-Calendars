  Doors8PM – Show\n \nSUBSONIC EYEBeginning in 2017 and based in Singapor
 e\, Subsonic Eye craft noise rock that convey the hectic\, fast-paced char
 acter of urban life through snappy\, invigorating hooks\, layered with sin
 ger Nur Wahidah’s restless velvety lilt. The quintet find possibilities 
 in embracing organic energy – at times taking root in post-punk dynamism
 \, at others blooming into primitivist folk cuts. On their fourth full-le
 ngth All Around You\, Subsonic Eye explore their relationship with nature 
 with renewed appreciation for its coexistence with urban cities. As if to 
 make this harmony manifest\, Subsonic Eye balances the scales with songs t
 hat pick apart the brutal and monotonous cycles of our capitalist setting.
  Though the subject matter can grind you down\, the songs instill purpose 
 and uplift listeners with undeniably hooky songwriting that combines the b
 est of Alvvays and Sonic Youth. Rather than succumb to doom\, Subsonic Ey
 e relishes the opportunity to meditate on these uncomfortable emotions to 
 find their way to the ultimate realisation that beauty is all around us.

  overarching narratives. Multi-layered in subject and form\, L’Rain’s 
 sonic explorations interrogate instead how multiplicities of emotion and e

 is searching for balance in the obliteration of binary logic.L’Rain is t
 he musical project of multi-instrumentalist\, composer\, performer\, and c
 urator\, Taja Cheek. Alongside Andrew Lappin and Ben Chapoteau-Katz\, she 
 has developed L’Rain into a shape-shifting entity that blurs the distinc

 mirrors the journey that brought L’Rain into being to begin with.\nFLANA

 n extended family of musicians from Fishtown\, Philadelphia. Founded in la
 te 2019 by lead singer\, James Everhart\, after 6 years on the road as Low
  Cut Connie’s lead guitar player\, The Guilt have merely existed as a re
 cording project during the long quarantine of 2020 with only two sold out 
 shows under their belts. As venues began to open in 2021\, The Guilt hit t
 he ground running with a string of sold out “debut” shows.\nIn May 202
 2\, The Guilt released their first\, self-titled album to great reception.
  The band spent their first year out of the pandemic performing with great
 s like White Denim\, Father John Misty\, Sharon Von Etten\, Charlie Crocke
 t\, and Jenny Lewis. By the end of the year\, “Cosmic Guilt” was named
  top 25 albums of 2022 by WXPN. Lead singles\, “Cautious Lovers” and 
 “Sun In Your Eyes” are lush folk orchestrations with Spaghetti Western
  and British influence – think Lee Hazelwood meets Fairport Convention.\
 n“Queen of the Dream”\, a folky electric jangler\, is The Guilt’s la
 test single to promote their new record\, “Palace of Depression”\, set
  to be released in late 2023/ early 2024.\n \nNo one is doing it like Cosm
 ic Guilt. Anywhere. Wrap yourself in it and let it give your zeal – guil
 t is for everyone. \nBRITTANY ANNE TRANBAUGH (9:00 PM)\n \n \nIn February 
 2023\, 31-year-old Brittany Ann Tranbaugh (pronounced TRAN-baw) finally qu
 it her office job to pursue a full-time music career. Though she began wri
 ting songs and playing gigs as a teenager\, multiple bouts of creative and
  mental health struggles—culminating in a several years-long hiatus from
  music altogether in her mid-to-late 20s—prevented her from ever taking 
 the full leap. Everything changed in 2021 when her longtime friend Jackson
  Emmer called her up and implored her to come out to Colorado and record h
 er backlog of original songs with him. Tranbaugh hit the road and spent a 
 week with Emmer in his home studio\, resulting in Quarter Life Crisis Hai
 rcut\, her comeback EP released in April 2022. Bouncing between witty sarc
 asm and heartbreaking vulnerability\, the songs tackled a wide range of to
 pics including her sixth grade queer awakening\, an awkward run-in with an
  old acquaintance\, and the impossibility of true folk music authenticity 
 in our modern age. Listening back to the finished product\, she began to f
 eel the flickers of confidence again. \n \nIn July 2022\, Tranbaugh’s q
 ueer Americana heartbreaker “Kiss You” was awarded Song of the Year in
  the John Lennon Songwriting Contest\, which came with a $20\,000 cash pri
 ze. She used the money to fly her band out to Los Angeles to record five s
 ongs with Grammy-winning producer Tyler Chester (Madison Cunningham\, Marg
 aret Glaspy\, Watkins Family Hour)\, which proved to be a life-affirming t
 rip. In March 2023\, Tranbaugh released the first song from this new batch
 \, the exuberant long-distance-relationship anthem “Can’t Wait No Rush
 .” Listeners can expect three more singles this summer and a self-titled
  EP in the fall. The new songs showcase Tranbaugh in her new era: energeti
 c\, self-assured\, surrounded by her beloved musical community\, and more 
 commanding as a vocalist and writer than ever before.\n\n\n\n\n

 n lockdown\, At the Hotspot\, produced by Joe Goddard and Al Doyle of Hot 
 Chip\, takes the raucous energy Warmduscher solidified on their critically
  acclaimed 2019 release Tainted Lunch\, and injects it with a slightly mor
 e polished\, ‘80s funk sound\, kind of like stumbling home to your squat
 ted loft after a drunken night at the local disco. It’s crunchy on the o
 utside\, smooth on the inside\, and might be the most immediately enjoyabl
 e music Warmduscher have ever graced us with.“There was a lot of partyin
 g\,” says Clams\, laughing about the gestation of the album. “We were 
 like\, Aaarrggghh. We were just happy to be doing something and seeing eac
 h other. It was that weird energy\, where you’re fed up and you’re kin
 d of angry\, but in a good way. We would spend like two nights a week writ
 ing\, maybe once or twice a month\, sometimes less.” This went on for ab
 out a year\, with all the members bringing in their contributions\, until 
 it came time to record—which\, in typical punk rock fashion\, had its ow
 n set of obstacles to overcome.The bulk of Warmduscher’s discography –
  the aforementioned Tainted Lunch\, as well as 2018’s Whale City and 201
 6’s Khaki Tears – were produced by London stalwart Dan Carey\, who was
  instrumental in helping the band hone their fuzzed out sound. Unfortunate
 ly\, at the beginning of At the Hotspot’s recording process\, Dan caught
  COVID\, and the band found themselves having to leave their comfort zone 
 and find a new producer fast. Luckily\, they found two\, under serendipito
 us circumstances. “I was in the studio with Joe and Al of Hot Chip\, doi
 ng an electronic project with Igor Cavallera of Sepultura and his wife\, a
 rtist/musician Laima\,” explains Clams. “When I got the message saying
  Dan couldn’t do the album\, I was like\, ‘Aw\, fuck!’ Then Joe and 
 Al were simply like\, ‘We’ll do it!’ It was this really weird\, happ
 y accident.”While At the Hotspot is still very much a Warmduscher album\
 , with all its cracks and crevices oozing garage rock bravado\, the produc
 tion values buff out those jagged edges in a way only these two virtuoso p
 roducers could have pulled off. “We’re just really psyched to play thi
 s whole thing live now\,” states Clams matter-of-factly. “And it’s a
  whole revamp—new label\, new producers\, new logo—new everything.”\

 M – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nAVA MIRZADEGAN\n \nAccompanied mos
 t often by spacious silence and a finger-picked nylon string guitar\, Ava 
 Mirzadegan writes quiet songs about longing\, letting go\, and befriending
  night skies. Written as a pivotal relationship came to an ending\, her de
 but album\, Dark Dark Blue\, begs the question: If someone falls apart in 
 their room\, and no one is around to hear it\, do they still make a sound?
 \n \nThe album is the work of a recorder of memories\, of conversations (o
 r parts of them anyway)—internal and external exchanges invoked over a p
 ile of chord clusters and heartbreak\, as the artist reckons with patterns
  of codependency and irregular attachment. Inspired by diarists Julie Doir
 on\, Yowler\, and The Innocence Mission\, Ava’s work is deeply concerned
  with the pangs of human connection.  Throughout the album\, written larg
 ely from the confines of her childhood bedroom\, she unearths ways to unde
 rstand how we share our hurt\, placing it in the hands of others as we see
 k to heal intergenerational wounds. Writing as a form of mudlarking\; with
  every hum she comes to terms with the jagged parts of existence that comp
 rise humanity\, picking up and inspecting the marks left on us by time and
  neglect.\n \nDark Dark Blue is an exploration of needs unmet\, maladaptiv
 e tendencies\, and attachments misplaced\, but it is a breakup record that
  flogs little blame. Lovingly voiced in spare and tenuous tones\, Mirzadeg
 an delicately holds a light up to the troubles of young lovers with their 
 ugly\, undressed wounds and self-projected images—desperate attempts to 
 control the stories they have inherited.  The album confronts issues abou
 t the ways in which we deprive ourselves of healthy human connection\, but
  like a friend who makes us tell the truth about ourselves.\n \n \n \n22

 crafting songs and recruiting a cast of friends to fill in the gaps. Prett

 debut album “A Light on Each Side”. Often appearing live as a six-piec

  both modern and classic\, refusing to be boxed in by conventional labels.
  The outcome is an ever-changing musical landscape that continues to evolv

 e is messy. Change is messy. Perhaps\, change is the messiest of them all.
  Especially when eyes are on you\; when you blast out of adolescence onto 
 stages across the country\, then into your twenties\, onto more stages and
 \, finally\, into your thirties—all on those same stages. The stages tha
 t Lydia Loveless has sung her heart out on\, has collapsed on\, and laughe
 d on\, all mirror the stages of her life thus far for the world to see. Wh
 en Loveless released her first album over a decade ago\, she was still a t
 eenager whose songs of debauchery\, guzzling alcohol and doing cocaine wer
 e an audio wet dream for a certain type of listener who not only wear thei
 r music tastes on their (tattooed) sleeve\, but in the lifestyle that they
  emulate: “outlaw” music with brains – akin to Steve Earle\, Drive-B
 y Truckers and Lucinda Williams\, vintage country heart with a heartland r
 ock soul.In the end\, the music industry is still sadly a man’s world an
 d\, as such\, Loveless grew up in the spotlight (or perhaps\, more accurat
 ely\, the bar lights) while she was placed on a pedestal. Her voicemail gr
 eeting is a tongue-in-cheek ode to this: “Hi\, this is Lydia Loveless\, 
 savior of cowpunk. Please leave a message and I will get back to you.” T
 he time between their late adolescence to now is defined by a shelf full o
 f records\, hundreds of thousands of miles on the road\, and a ribbon of h
 eartbreaks pockmarking their trail. Loveless is a fiercely brave writer wh
 o bluntly assesses their life in song: their struggles with alcohol and de
 pression\, and the uncertainty of not only the future\, but what piecing t
 ogether the past will mean for the present. \nREESE MCHENRYReese McHenry 
 came up swinging in Northern Minnesota and she didn’t sit still for very
  long. A true troubadour\, her powerful voice has driven her from the fres
 h greens of Eau Claire to the dusty motels of Albuquerque and everywhere i
 n between. Since settling in North Carolina\, this prolific songwriter and
  jagged performer has lent her fire and talent to a number of recording pr
 ojects and now turns her attention to her own damn show. Her songs defy ge
 nre and\, though one could still categorize them as straight-shooting “r
 ock\,” the real thread connecting these songs is a wry brand of humor mi
 xed with an ability to catch a hook at just the right moment. McHenry’s 
 true signature\, of course\, is her emotive blues voice that can change at
  any moment from soft sweetness to a torrential downpour. Reese lives in N
 orth Carolina and is currently touring with a band as well as solo.\n

 – Doors9 PM – ShowTHE LONE BELLOWThe Lone Bellow burst onto the scene 
 with their self-titled debut in 2013. The Nashville-based trio (Zach Willi
 ams\, Brian Elmquist\, Kanene Pipkin) quickly became known for their trans
 cendent harmonies\, serious musicianship and raucous live performance — 
 creating what NPR calls\, ‘earnest and magnetic folk-pop built to shake 
 the rafters.’ In 2015\, the band released Then Came The Morning\, produc
 ed by The National’s Aaron Dessner. The album was nominated for an Ameri
 cana Music Award and took the band to numerous late night shows including 
 Jimmy Kimmel Live\, Late Show With David Letterman and Later…with Jools 
 Holland\, among others. In 2017\, The Lone Bellow returned with Walk Into 
 A Storm\, produced by legendary music producer Dave Cobb (Chris Stapleton\
 , Brandi Carlile\, Sturgill Simpson)\, followed by 2020’s Half Moon Ligh
 t\, an artistic triumph the band worked toward for years. In a departure 
 from their past work with elite producers Dessner and Cobb\, the trio stru
 ck out on their own for their fifth full-length album Love Songs for Loser
 s\, dreaming up a singular sound encompassing everything from arena-ready 
 rock anthems to the gorgeously sprawling Americana tunes the band refers t
 o as “little redneck symphonies.” Recorded at the possibly haunted for
 mer home of the legendary Roy Orbison\, the result is an intimate meditati
 on on the pain and joy and ineffable wonder of being human\, at turns hear
 tbreaking\, irreverent\, and sublimely transcendent.\nSTEPHEN WILSON JR.St
 ephen Wilson Jr. opens every one of his performances the exact same way\, 
 by walking to the microphone and introducing himself to the crowd: “I’
 m Stephen Wilson Jr. — I am my father’s son.” The Nashville-by- way-
 of-Indiana singer followed his father into the boxing ring as a child\, be
 fore diverging from his dad’s path to become a scientist and\, eventuall
 y\, a songwriter. “My first stage wasn’t a stage at all\, it was a box
 ing ring\,” says Wilson\, who pays tribute to his father and processes h
 is unexpected death on his debut album Son of Dad. “Writing and making t
 his album has been very therapeutic for me to learn who I am and what my e
 xistence looks like after my father\,” he says. “Because life has to g
 o on.” Wilson’s creative life began in earnest upon moving to Nashvil
 le\, where he signed a publishing deal and had his songs recorded by stars
  like Brothers Osborne and Caitlyn Smith (in a collab with Old Dominion). 
 Now signed to Big Loud Records\, he’s telling his own story on Son of Da
 d through songs like his autobiographical centerpiece “Father’s Son.
 ” He’s also performing to audiences around the world: Wilson has playe
 d festivals everywhere from CMA Fest in Nashville to the Black Deer Festiv
 al in the U.K.\, and toured with artists like Midland\, Hailey Whitters\, 
 Larry Fleet and The Lone Bellow. All of this led Rolling Stone to name him
  “one of the most interesting artists to watch this year\, a true origin

 – Doors9 PM – Show\nTHE LONE BELLOWThe Lone Bellow burst onto the scen
 e with their self-titled debut in 2013. The Nashville-based trio (Zach Wil
 liams\, Brian Elmquist\, Kanene Pipkin) quickly became known for their tra
 nscendent harmonies\, serious musicianship and raucous live performance 
 — creating what NPR calls\, ‘earnest and magnetic folk-pop built to sh
 ake the rafters.’ In 2015\, the band released Then Came The Morning\, pr
 oduced by The National’s Aaron Dessner. The album was nominated for an A
 mericana Music Award and took the band to numerous late night shows includ
 ing Jimmy Kimmel Live\, Late Show With David Letterman and Later…with Jo
 ols Holland\, among others. In 2017\, The Lone Bellow returned with Walk I
 nto A Storm\, produced by legendary music producer Dave Cobb (Chris Staple
 ton\, Brandi Carlile\, Sturgill Simpson)\, followed by 2020’s Half Moon 
 Light\, an artistic triumph the band worked toward for years. In a depart
 ure from their past work with elite producers Dessner and Cobb\, the trio 
 struck out on their own for their fifth full-length album Love Songs for L
 osers\, dreaming up a singular sound encompassing everything from arena-re
 ady rock anthems to the gorgeously sprawling Americana tunes the band refe
 rs to as “little redneck symphonies.” Recorded at the possibly haunted
  former home of the legendary Roy Orbison\, the result is an intimate medi
 tation on the pain and joy and ineffable wonder of being human\, at turns 
 heartbreaking\, irreverent\, and sublimely transcendent.\nSTEPHEN WILSON J
 R.Stephen Wilson Jr. opens every one of his performances the exact same wa
 y\, by walking to the microphone and introducing himself to the crowd: “
 I’m Stephen Wilson Jr. — I am my father’s son.” The Nashville-by- 
 way-of-Indiana singer followed his father into the boxing ring as a child\
 , before diverging from his dad’s path to become a scientist and\, event
 ually\, a songwriter. “My first stage wasn’t a stage at all\, it was a
  boxing ring\,” says Wilson\, who pays tribute to his father and process
 es his unexpected death on his debut album Son of Dad. “Writing and maki
 ng this album has been very therapeutic for me to learn who I am and what 
 my existence looks like after my father\,” he says. “Because life has 
 to go on.” Wilson’s creative life began in earnest upon moving to Nas
 hville\, where he signed a publishing deal and had his songs recorded by s
 tars like Brothers Osborne and Caitlyn Smith (in a collab with Old Dominio
 n). Now signed to Big Loud Records\, he’s telling his own story on Son o
 f Dad through songs like his autobiographical centerpiece “Father’s So
 n.” He’s also performing to audiences around the world: Wilson has pla
 yed festivals everywhere from CMA Fest in Nashville to the Black Deer Fest
 ival in the U.K.\, and toured with artists like Midland\, Hailey Whitters\
 , Larry Fleet and The Lone Bellow. All of this led Rolling Stone to name h
 im “one of the most interesting artists to watch this year\, a true orig
 inal.”\nHEART OF GOLD VIP– One General Admission ticket to see The Lon

 aby’\n \nThere’s a song called “Sudden Relief” on Dancer\, the new
  Born Without Bones album\, that’s unlike anything Scott Ayotte has ever
  written before. That’s not because of the evolution of the Milford\, MA
  outfit from solo project to fully-fledged band\, either. Guitarist Jonath
 an Brucato and bassist Jim Creighton have been a part of the permanent lin
 e-up for a long time now\, and Super American’s Sam Checkoway – who pl
 ayed on last year’s re-recorded retrospective EP\, Pictures Of The Sun 
 – was behind the kit for the whole record\, the first time in the band
 ’s history that that’s happened. This goes even deeper. It’s the fir
 st time that Ayotte has written a love song that’s not about love going 
 or having gone wrong. Quite the opposite\, in fact.\n \n“It’s written 
 not from the perspective of having lost love but having gained love\,” h
 e explains. “Before\, I didn’t write about any relationships until the
 y were over\, and it wasn’t usually in the most positive way. But this i
 s a positive song I wrote for and about my girlfriend. Even though it says
  the nice things about her\, I decided to keep in the not so nice things a
 bout me – because she’s also signing up for those. Luckily\, she’s l
 oving of both.” \n \nTHE VAUGHNS\n \nEqual Vision Records and NJ/NYC-ba
 sed indie-rock band The Vaughns are excited to announce the Friday\, Septe

 oking to make their California dreams a reality. But zzzahara has always b
 een here\, turning reality into a dream. Born and raised in Highland Park\
 , where they still reside\, zzzahara (the solo moniker of Eyedress/Simps g
 uitarist Zahara Jaime) has witnessed both gang-blighted and gentrified L.A
 . along the same geographical blocks. Like the transforming city itself\, 
 zzzahara has undergone massive personal changes\, their characteristic sto
 icism giving way to a newfound sense of purpose. Liminal Spaces\, their de
 but LP from Lex Records\, explores a life hanging in the balance between m
 emory and possibility over frenetic Johnny Marr-esque guitar jangle.Music 
 has always been an escape for zzzahara\, who struggled to feel seen as the
  sibling of a terminally ill brother. Z found solace in bands like My Chem
 ical Romance\, the Cure\, the Ramones\, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs\, and in recor
 ding “corny acoustic parodies” about girls they had crushes on in midd
 le school. That same absurdist humor followed them into early projects lik
 e bombastic hip-hop persona Lil Boba and post-punk quartet Zahara & the He
 rd\, though as a queer person of color\, zzzahara still felt out of place 
 in SoCal’s bro-ish garage rock scene.But over time\, zzzahara’s inner 
 circle crystalized around talented\, prolific friends. They became touring
  guitarist for Eyedress after meeting Idris Vicuña in 2018. That partners
 hip spawned collaborative duo The Simps\, whose first single “On Fye” 
 has already racked up more than five million streams. Stones Throw enginee
 r Collin Davis helped zzzahara expand their production techniques\, and th
 e pair recently formed electronic post-punk project U.S. Velvet\, releasin
 g their first single in October 2021. All the while\, zzzahara demoed song
 s like others might keep a diary. Some\, like “Sugar Gay” and “Xxxst
 asy\,” became stand-alone singles\, while others were collected for Simp
 .Wav\, the four-song debut EP zzzahara released in 2020.Signing to Lex Rec
 ords\, zzzahara bumped up production values for Liminal Spaces\, enlisting
  industry vets Dave Cooley for mastering and Steve Kaye for mixing. Some o
 f the songs have been with Z for a while\, like “Julia\,” written when
  zzzahara was just sixteen about their experiences with manipulative girlf
 riends. Others are inspired by queer culture\, absurdism\, love\, lust\, a
 nd feeling lost. Evolving stylistically\, maturing emotionally\, and yet s
 till attached to a past scorched by trauma and old flames\, zzzahara bring
 s pop sensibility and hi-fi quality to Liminal Spaces that makes their wor
 k appealing to anyone and everyone: young and old\; straight and queer\; i
 ntroverts and extroverts\; the hardened L.A. locals and the daydreaming tr
 ansplants.\n

 – Doors8 PM – Show\n \nLILLY HIATTLately is a record I wrote to share 
 some of where I’ve been with you. Whenever songs happen for me\, they ar
 e like photographs of time.Last year was tough. That’s an understatement
  for certain. Tears were shed\, lives were lost\, and lonely was a way of 
 life. I have always felt lonely\, but never gone to the depths of solitude
  that I had in 2020. The irony of that is\, I was not alone at all in that
  space. Everyone had lost something\, and we all were trying to rebuild ou
 r lives as we knew them.As a means of keeping sane\, I started to write so
 ngs. Some of them sucked. I kept doing it though\, because I had nothing e
 lse to fill my cup. “The Last Tear” came and I thought\, I’d like to
  share this. That opened the door for more. “Been” happened not too lo
 ng after\, reminiscing about this and that\, and so on. The inspiration wa
 s occurring from simple moments\, such as gathering with my family after m
 onths of not doing so. Or walking around looking at my neighbors on their 
 porches and waving a hello.I also was finally catching up with myself\, an
 d understanding I was reeling from some of my missteps. Forgiveness can oc
 cur through written words for me\, so it was quite soothing to have my gui
 tars and a melody. Depression was a big part of fall and winter. I forgot 
 how down I could feel. But I also felt hope in that light that came from a
  memory of a past adventure or a stranger’s smile while walking down the
  street. Little things lifted my spirits.I missed my friends. I missed my 
 family. I was devastated by the grief our country was facing\, as well as 
 the world. I felt unified in knowing that I was not on my own in that ment
 ality. Many were questioning a lot of what was happening and though ideolo
 gies and understandings were fractured and opposing\, most people I know c
 raved to be together again.I realized that my heart was full of everything
  I loved and that would carry me forward for the time being. Eventually we
  would all get back to one another.Now that we are beginning to\, I will b
 e thrilled to share and play these songs for you.Much Love\,Lilly Hiatt\n

 ing as “real life”. There is only experience and the negotiations we u
 ndertake in order to share it with other people. On her second album Blue 
 Raspberry\, the New York-based songwriter Katy Kirby dives headlong into t
 he artifice of intimacy: the glitter smeared across eyelid creases\, the s
 miles switched on with an electric buzz\, the synthetic rose scent all ove
 r someone who’s made herself smell nice just for you. An exegesis of Kir
 by’s first queer relationship\, Blue Raspberry traces the crescendo and 
 collapse of new love\, savoring each gleaming shard of rock candy and brok
 en glass along the way. Originally from Spicewood\, Texas\, Kirby was liv
 ing in Nashville when she started writing Blue Raspberry’s title track\,
  the first of the album’s songs to take shape. “‘Blue Raspberry’ i
 s the oldest song on the record. I began to write it a month or so before 
 I realized\, I think I’m queer\,” she says. “There’s a tradition o
 f yearning in country love songs. I like the male yearning songs better\, 
 usually. I started writing ‘Blue Raspberry\,’ and I was thinking about
 \, if I was in love with a woman\, what would I love about her? Especially
  if she was someone that I couldn’t touch\, but that I was pining for. W
 hat would I be caught on? And I thought that I would probably be particula
 rly charmed by the choices she made on how to look after she woke up in th
 e morning. I thought about tackiness\, and the ways that’s a dirty word.
  That’s where the title comes from — loving someone for those choices\
 , for the artificiality.” Blue Raspberry follows Kirby’s acclaimed de
 but album Cool Dry Place\, which was also recorded in Nashville and releas
 ed in February of 2021. While the songs on that record unfold amidst Kirby
  finding her voice\, Blue Raspberry is a polished and confident sophomore 
 effort that deepens the questions that bubbled through Cool Dry Place abou
 t how people can reach each other despite all the hazard zones where human
  connection caves in.\n \nALLEGRA KRIEGER“I Keep My Feet on the Fragile 
 Plane” – Allegra Krieger’s fourth record and her first with Double D
 ouble Whammy – is her most mature and alluring work yet. It contains all
  the signatures of her best lyricism: delicate and precise phrasings\, mom
 ents that flicker between beauty and banality\, meaning that forms through
  the accretion of observations\, memories\, and unexpected adages. This is
  an album that is at once post-theistic and devoted to a relationship with
  the divine\, each song blinking in and out of “the fragile plane\,” a
  place Krieger describes as “a middle ground in the universe\,” both a
 bstract and peaceful\, where time\, bodies\, and names don’t exist.\n

 – Doors9 PM – Show\n \nMICHAEL NAUMichael Nau is your favorite band’
 s favorite songwriter. Since the mid 2000’s\, he’s crafted a catalog o
 f thoughtful\, reflective songs as the frontman of indie-rock mainstays Co
 tton Jones\, Page France\, and Michael Nau & The Mighty Thread. Now\, he
 ’s set to release the fifth full-length record under his own name. Accom
 pany is due out 12/08/2023 on Karma Chief Records. All 11 tracks come toge
 ther to paint a beautiful picture. The lyrics invoke the listener’s imag
 ination throughout. They’re introspective\, but vague and open-ended. Th
 e indie rock backdrop shows signs of psych-soul influence with dry and pun
 chy drums\, lush synth lines\, and tastefully verb-soaked vocal production
 . Sweeping string arrangements and French horn runs add cinematic motion t
 o the waltz-y “Shiftshaping” (track 4). Slide guitar and a shuffling s
 nare drum add some get-up-and-go to “Painting a Wall” (track 2). Nau
 ’s vocal delivery falls somewhere between crooning to a crowd\, telling 
 stories to a loved one\, and musing to himself.\n \nBREEZERS\n

 – Doors9 PM – Show\n \nDESTROYER (SOLO)Destroyer’s latest album\, LA
 BYRINTHITIS\, brims with mystic and intoxicating terrain\, the threads of 
 Dan Bejar’s notes woven through by a trove of allusions at once eerily f
 amiliar and intimately perplexing. The record circuitously draws ever inwa
 rd\, each turn offering giddy surprise\, anxious esoterica\, and thumping 
 emotionality at equal odds. “Do you remember the mythic beast?” Bejar 
 asks at the outset of “Tintoretto\, It’s for You\,” the album’s fi
 rst single\, casting torchlight over the labyrinth’s corridors. “Tinto
 retto\, it’s for you/ The ceiling’s on fire and the contract is bindin
 g.” Delivered in a Marlene Dietrich smolder\, Bejar’s lyrical menace s
 eeps like smoke through the brazen march’s woozy synths and dizzied guit
 ar. “There’s some character here that feels new to me\, a low drawl\, 
 an evening gown draped over a piano\,” Bejar says of the song. Throughou
 t\, LABYRINTHITIS insists that everything’s not all right\, but that eve
 n isolation and dissolution can be a source of joy— stepping into the su
 nlight at the other end of the maze in your ear\, Bejar strolling alongsid
 e like a wild-maned\, leisure- suited minotaur.\n \nLIGHTNING DUST\n
