 been anything but. Beginning with his early-’90s indie rock band Archers
  of Loaf\, the one-time Appalachian State University saxophone major moved
  through several generations to craft a relentlessly independent and uncom
 promising rock & roll journey. Archers of Loaf would slowly amass a devote
 d cult following on the strength of albums like All the Nations Airports a
 nd White Trash Heroes. Before Archers of Loaf disbanded in the late ’90s
 \, Bachmann would be well into side project Barry Black and on the way to 
 his long-running dark songwriting moniker Crooked Fingers. Throughout the 
 2000s and 2010s\, Bachmann’s output was strong and consistent\, both as 
 Crooked Fingers and under his own name. \nJENNIFER O’CONNORJennifer O

  a northeast tour last fall and are known for their dancey & chaotic live 
 shows. They recently made their 2nd appearance at New Colossus Festival\, 
 a showcase festival for bands around the world and have teamed up with GUS
 TAF for a benefit show later this summer.\n\n \nCLOAKZ\nCLOAKZ started as
  a solo recording project for Zac Ciangaclini while living in New York and
  playing drums in the band Raccoon Fighter. He recorded the project’s fi
 rst E.P by sneaking time in between sessions at the studio where he worked
  and polishing up the tracks at home. After moving to Philly he recruited 
 bass player and longtime friend Tony Aquilino (Looser\, Sun Hat)\, and a r
 otating lineup that solidified in 2019 with drummer Greg Foran (Lightningi
 ng\, Flatwaves)\, guitarist James Keary (Heavy Shrug\, MiniBoone)\, and ke
 yboardist S. Catoe (Heavy Shrug\, Oicho Kabu). The new lineup was gaining 
 momentum in the Philly scene in early 2020 when COVID struck\, derailing t
 he band’s recording plans and forcing them to cancel all foreseeable sho

 l length album\, new shows\, a new record label (Mint400) and a new music

 bands\, guitarist and vocalist Mike Chick and drummer Biff Swenson met pla

 hich began after Chick bought a baritone guitar and suggested they start a
  two-piece band. Yawn Mower is known for their fuzz-rock guitars\, crunch
 y hooks and sense of humor as The Jersey Journal describes their blend o
 f music to be “spazzy surf rock” and a “comedic two-man guitar/drums
  act who look and sound like two of The Muppets.”They released several E

 n his first album under this new moniker\, titled BLK VINTAGE\, BLK ODYSSY
 ―born and raised in Plainfield\, NJ\, based in Austin\, TX― dives into
  his personal history as a Black musician and the world he’s grown up ar
 ound. It’s an album deeply informed by individual experiences but applie
 d to the plight of Black Americans everywhere. Even when the album chooses
  smooth vibes and laid back lyrics in favor of overt activism\, there’s 
 a philosophical bent that inspires BLK ODYSSY’s work. BLK VINTAGE is ins
 pired by a few key moments and artists. There’s the death of BLK ODYSSY
 ’s brother\, who was killed at the hands of police officers while BLK OD
 YSSY was living in New Jersey. It’s the seminal moment of BLK ODYSSY’s
  life\, the moment he was forced to become an adult and reckon with the ha
 rsh reality of being Black in America. It fuels everything he does\, espec
 ially his activism.After making a name for himself as an Americana musicia
 n\, BLK ODYSSY decided to ditch the popularity he gained in favor of creat
 ing music that would reflect his own experiences and worldview. The result
  is BLK ODYSSY\, and this first project\, BLK VINTAGE\, moves with the urg
 ency of an artist finally realizing their true sound. “I want to create 
 something that will be culturally impactful for my people. I want to do so
 mething that is impactful on a larger scale\, something that is for groups
  of Black people across the country.” There’s “1980\,” which slink
 s with the rich funk-soul of artists like Anderson .Paak and Knxwledge\, b
 ut BLK ODYSSY’s half-rapped cadence is wholly unique and utterly intoxic
 ating. The moments of levity hit equally as hard as the work refracted thr
 ough the trauma BLK ODYSSY has experienced. Still\, though\, BLK ODYSSY ha
 s the rare ability to present multiple sides of himself. “Hang Low” is
  a sultry love jam\, strutting with velvet harmonies and a bass line strai
 ght out of the Pino Palladino school of indestructible grooves.The good ti
 mes occasionally give way to introspection and remembrance\, though. The d
 eath of BLK ODYSSY’s brother makes its way into the powerful “Drinking
  Good\,” but he balances it with a desire to inspire the next generation
 . “My goal is to connect with the black youth\, and my goal is to connec
 t with my people and speak to them on a level where we can stop suffering 
 from happening\,” he explains. “There’s only so much we can do for t
 he dead. This record asks: ‘How can we stop this from happening again?'
 ” Though the music is deeply tied to BLK ODYSSY’s own identity\, he sp
 eaks a universal music in his language\, one easily relatable for those th
 at want to see a better world.\nBLK ODYSSY’s VIP Package:\n\nOne merch i

 e that they are delusional about Sour Widows\, the Bay Area band they star
 ted seven years ago that is just now releasing its entrancing and powerful
  debut LP\, ‘Revival of a Friend’. In those seven years\, Sinaiko and 
 Thomson each endured losses and hardships that at times required putting b
 igger plans on hold\; looking back\, they can only laugh at these hurdles 
 and wonder if they should have taken them as signs—to stop\, to start ov
 er\, to succumb to the hardship.\nYOUBETNick Llobet (they/them) was ready 
 to throw in the towel. Llobet\, who grew up in South Florida\, learned to 
 play guitar at a very young age\, dabbling in everything from classical\, 
 blues\, classic rock\, and flamenco. They’d spent much of their early 20
 s searching for their voice as an artist and as an individual\, as well as
  for a musical community. Llobet would eventually move to Brooklyn\, but a
 fter three years of looking for a hopeful artistic breakthrough\, they spe
 nt much of their time in seclusion\, consumed by social anxiety and impost
 er syndrome—and they were considering abandoning songwriting completely.
  One day\, while commuting through Penn Station and en route to their par
 tner’s family home in Virginia (that would also lead to the crucial purc
 hase of a secondhand Tascam cassette recorder)\, they noticed Patti Smith 
 sitting alone\, waiting for a train. The typically shy Llobet decided to a
 pproach the icon\, who was\, in turn\, delighted to see that Llobet was ca
 rrying a guitar. At the end of their interaction\, Smith offered some part
 ing wisdom: “She wished me luck and said\, ‘Practice hard\, Nick.’

 ow have remained largely independent – musically\, professionally\, and
  aesthetically\, since their beginning\, meticulously crafting and perfect
 ing a sound that is melded together from pieces of folk\, soul\, and rock 
 n’ roll. On 13th September\, they will release their new album Divided 
 Kind. This album is the lifetime’s work of two scholars of music whose i
 ndividual backgrounds in the arts have forged a strict artistic discipline
  that exists in sharp contrast to the more traditionally laissez-faire wor
 ld of rock and popular music. Over a catalog of six albums\, Native Harro
 w have produced a discography of “rich\, engrossing records” and “in
 stant classics” while single-mindedly following their own artistic code\
 , acquiescing only to the exigence of the song: each song its own world wi
 th its own rules. Their original perspective and extraordinary songwritin
 g\, combined with a completely individual approach to crafting albums and 
 steering their career\, has garnered them coverage at Uncut\, Mojo\, The 
 Guardian\, Rolling Stone\, The Line of Best Fit\, Paste\, American Songwri
 ter\, The Bluegrass Situation\, Holler\, Rough Trade\, Telegraph\, The Eve
 ning Standard\, The Times\, Shindig\, The Sun\, and many more. They’ve 
 shared stages with the Eagles\, Robert Plant & Alison Kraus\, Beth Hart\
 , Sierra Ferrell\, The Heavy Heavy\, Courtney Marie Andrews\, The Cactus 
 Blossoms\, Great Lake Swimmers\, Esme Patterson\, and more.\nWhereas Nativ
 e Harrow’s previous records have grown increasingly more expansive\, bot
 h stylistically and in terms of the musical forces applied\, Divided Kind 
 counters this categorical unfurling with a lateral move towards the ground
 \, with both feet firmly planted\, in a folk-soul-rock sound that still ex
 plores their love of RnB\, jazz\, country\, and farther-flung inspirations
  while simultaneously digging in\, with more authority\, to the musical wo
 rld they have constructed. Or maybe they’re still searching\, and Divide
 d Kind is what’s next. Their refusal to be put in a box\, and their rele
 ntless insistence on catering to the demands of each individual song sugge
 sts the latter is likely the truth at hand.\n \n\n

  betrays the simple truth that the road here was not without difficulty. R
 eferring to the 2021 breakout An Overview on Phenomenal Nature as her “i

 en it came to touring and releasing her own music. “I was channeling wha
 t I knew in that moment — feeling lost\,” Jenkins recalls. “When tha
 t record came out\, and people started to respond to what I had written\, 
 my plans to quit were foiled in the most unexpected\, heartening\, and gen
 erous way. Ready or not\, it reinvigorated me.”Immediately upon finishin
 g two years of touring An Overview\, Jenkins approached recording a follow
 -up\, only to find that capturing the creative spark while “running on f
 umes” was tough. “I was coming from a place of burn out and depletion\
 , and in the months following the session\, I struggled to accept that I d
 idn’t like the record I had just made. It felt uninspired\,” she confe
 sses\, “so I started over.” With her closest musical co-conspirators r
 eassembled\, and producer\, engineer\, and mixer Andrew Lappin (L’Rain\,
  Slauson Malone 1) behind the board\, Jenkins set the prior sessions aside
  and began constructing My Light\, My Destroyer from its ashes: “When we
  listened back in the control room that first day\, I could see a space on
  my record shelf start to open up\, because the songs were finding their h
 ome in real time. That spark informed the blueprint for the rest of the al
 bum\, and its completion was propelled by a newfound momentum.”\n

 from Marnie Stern\, but when her guitar bursts in like a shower of stardus
 t on The Comeback Kid\, the follow-up to 2013’s The Chronicles of Marnia
 \, it’s like no time has passed.But this is no nostalgia trip. The Comeb
 ack Kid is a statement of intent. “I can’t keep on moving backwards\,
 ” Stern repeats on anthemic opening track “Plain Speak\,” her finger
 s furiously tapping the fretboard as the song joyfully zips forward like a
  rocket hitting warp speed. Stern continually pushes herself outside of he
 r comfort zone throughout The Comeback Kid\, including not leaning on the 
 tapping technique that launched a thousand Eddie Van Halen comparisons. 
 “Til It’s Over” is as straight-ahead an “alternative rock” song 
 as Stern has ever made and there’s a cover of Ennio Morricone’s “Il 
 Girotondo Della Note.”“It was so great to be able to start being mysel
 f again and when I would think\, ‘Oh\, is that too\, too weird?’ I’d
  remember I’m allowed to do whatever I want! This is mine. It’s me\,
 ” says Stern of writing songs for The Comeback Kid. “I’m trying to g
 o against the grain of this bullshit that when you get older\, you lose yo
 ur sense of taste. I want to empower people to not be so homogenous and go
  against the grain a little bit.”Taking joy in your individuality is the
  message of The Comeback Kid\, as is the realization that making music whi
 ch truly reflects who you are in all your brightness and your weirdness is
  quite possibly the key to happiness. “This record is about reassuring y
 ourself that happiness is not about what kind of things you have or how ma
 ny things you have or what you don’t have—it’s about all the good th
 ings you do\,” says Stern.\nGOLD DIME\nGold Dime is an unapologetic art 
 rock band & the brainchild of Andrya Ambro\, best known as half the duo Ta

 eleased in 2019\, both on Fire Talk. Gold Dime released their third album 
 No More Blue Skies this past October on No Gold – a new imprint from Ang

 espair that’s defined much of the past few years of American life\, exam
 ining the power (or naïveté\, depending on your perspective) of positive

 are warm and intimate to match\, delivered with a soulful\, ’70s-inspire
 d palette of playful Wurlitzer\, breezy guitars\, and muscular percussion.

 roduced debut\, You’re Dreaming. Dates with Kacey Musgraves\, Jenny Lewi
 s\, and Lucius followed\, as did raves from the New York Times and NPR\, w

 oors8 PM – Show\n \nMERCE LEMON\nWhen asked how the city of Pittsburhg 
 has inspired her creative practice\, she responds with a characteristic jo
 ke wrapped in an earthen warmth – “There are big hills\, three rivers\
 , and more bridges than anywhere in the whole world.” Growing up in a fa
 mily of art and music in a city with a small\, but vigorously supportive s
 cene\, Merce has been going to shows here her whole life\, even playing th
 em with the “grown up” friends of her parents – as recently as a few
  years ago\, her band was comprised of her own father and his peers in the
  Pittsburgh music community.Merce took a step back in 2020\, after releasi
 ng her last album Moonth\, to reassess during an era of anxiety and lockdo
 wn – even the reliably nourishing exercise of releasing and playing musi
 c felt precarious. “I was grappling with what kind of relationship I wan
 ted with music in my life. It was just something I’d always done\, and I
  didn’t want to lose the magic of that – but I was just having less fu
 n.” In this time of restless confusion\, she turned her gaze inwardly\, 
 down to the roots – figuratively and literally.“I got dirty and slept 
 outside most of the summer. I learned a lot about plants and farming\, jus
 t writing for myself\, and in that time I just slowly accumulated songs.
 ” A never-ending creative hunger\, supported by the community framework 
 she’d always been able to depend on\, had been newly fertilized by the w
 ide-eyed inspiration that came from plunging her hands into both the earth
 ’s soil and her own. Rooting around for an answer\, finding and turning 
 in her palms what had been buried there all along – from this rediscover
 y\, imbued with the vitality of earth’s green magic\, Watch Me Drive The
 m Dogs Wild sprouted forth.\n \nGREG FREEMAN\n“Greg Freeman deals in bi
 blical deluges\, apocalyptic fever dreams\, Floridian miscreants\, and gre
 en mountain malaise. On his excellent debut LP “I Looked Out\,” Gregs
 ’s voice takes center stage\, creaking\, crooning\, and cutting through 
 clouds of static. The songs are linked together by a palpable urgency\, wh
 ether it is the punch-in-the-face\, careening momentum of “Tower\,” th
 e country-gazing guitar squall of “Souvenir Heart\,” or the singalong 
 finale of “Palms.” Careful arrangements and production choices bring o
 ut the best of the 7-piece band that ornament the album with pedal steel\,
  horns\, eerie strings\, and tape warbles. Greg’s strong narrative songw
 riting is equally effective chronicling the demise of a 1920s ocean liner 
 as it is documenting his own interpersonal uncertainties. The sounds on th
 e record conjure up the feeling of driving around Chittenden County in the
  middle of winter\, high beams on\, slush on the floor mats. It’s hard f
 or me to imagine a more promising debut record\, and I can’t wait to see
  where this band goes next.” – Garrett Linck\n \nMARY ST MARY\nPhilad

 oors8 PM – Show\nFRENCH CASSETTES\nFrench Cassettes music is filled with
  winding melodies that pop up unexpectedly but grab hold and don’t let g
 o… and may leave you asking “who needs hands with hooks like these?”
 The harmony-driven power-pop quartet’s new LP\, Rolodex (Sophomore LP re
 leased on Tender Loving Empire)\, was conceived beneath a stairwell in the
  band’s adopted hometown of San Francisco\, where frontman Scott Huerta 
 spent months staying up until 4 am\, obsessing over elaborate demos that w
 ould eventually become his band’s sophomore album. “I adopted the ment
 ality\, which was probably unhealthy\, that every song I wrote needed to b
 e my favorite song\,” he remembers. “I lost my mind so many times in t
 he middle of the night.” The album was self-recorded by lead guitarist 
 Mackenzie Bunch in just about every corner of the Bay Area\, and the songs
  that were eventually stitched together are hook-filled and rooted in pop.
  But they’re also layered and intricate recordings: complex vocal harmon
 ies and counter-harmonies\, Rob Mills’ inventive percussion\, Thomas’ 
 (Scott’s brother) honey-coated basslines\, and every shade of clean and 
 fuzzy guitars stacked up like an orchestra. These uncommonly majestic\, es
 oteric pop forms serve as the perfect delivery service for Huerta’s play
 ful and verbose lyrics\, which are often presented as semi-autobiographica
 l puzzles.Taken together\, the eight tracks and 24 minutes that make up Ro
 lodex are an epic statement of purpose in a decidedly taut package. One th
 at brought a band back together\, more mature and more ambitious than ever

 ange is the only law.”With a credo adapted from science fiction author O
 ctavia E. Butler\, an album title from a collection of metaphysical poetry
 \, and an expansion in consciousness brought on by personal crisis\, guita
 rist and songwriter Shana Cleveland learns to embrace a changing world wit
 h unconditional love on News of the Universe\, the new full-length from Ca
 lifornia rock band La Luz.News of the Universe is a record born of calamit
 y\, a work of dark\, beautiful psychedelia reflecting Cleveland’s experi
 ence of having her world blown apart by a breast cancer diagnosis just two
  years after the birth of her son. It’s also a portrait of a band in flu
 x\, marking the first appearance for drummer Audrey Johnson and the final 
 ones from longtime members bassist Lena Simon and keyboardist Alice Sandah
 l\, whose contributions add a bittersweet edge to a record that is both el
 egy for an old world and cosmic road map to a strange new one.But is there
  any band in the world more suited to capturing the chaos of change in all
  its messy beauty than La Luz? Formed by Cleveland in 2012\, La Luz is bel
 oved for their ability to balance bedlam and bliss\, each new record anoth
 er fine-tuning of the band’s mix of swaggering riffs with angelic vocals
  borrowed from doo-wop and folk\; a band so reliably great that it makes t
 he huge step forward in confidence and sheer musicality that is News of th
 e Universe all the more formidable. Cleveland\, also a writer and painter\
 , has developed into a truly original songwriter with her own canon of hau
 nted psychedelia that\, in recent years\, has drawn upon the changing land
 scape around her rural California home for inspiration\, notably on last y
 ear’s critically acclaimed solo release\, Manzanita\, a magical realist 
 documentation of her pregnancy and early motherhood that appeared on many 
 year-end lists.Yet if Cleveland has spent years writing songs about ghosts
 \, what lurks in the shadows of News of the Universe is nothing less than 
 death itself. “There are moments on this album that sound to me like the
  last frantic confession before an asteroid destroys the earth\,” says C
 leveland.\nMIA JOY\nMia Joy has had music in her bones her entire life. Ra
 ised in a spiritual home to Musician and Poet parents\, Mia has been singi
 ng since she was a baby and joined the Chicago Children’s Choir at a you
 ng age. Mia’s brand of ethereal pop is equally indebted to 90s R&B Icons
  such as Sade to the ethereal ambient compositions of Grouper. “I bought
  my loop pedal because it’s the same loop pedal that Liz Harris of Group
 er had. I just spent my college check on it.” Spirit Tamer\, Mia’s deb
 ut record out on Fire Talk on April 30th 2021\, draws influences from both
 : emotive synth pop (“Haha”\, “See Us”) and yearning meditative in
 terludes that trace the peripheral edges between tracks. The album title c
 omes from a poem Joy wrote long ago (“writing was my first love”)\, an
 d the melding of her creative upbringing interweaves a sonic history that 
 unfolds as Joy herself attempts to piece together the fractured pieces tha
 t shape growing up and growing into your own skin.\n

 lue” songwriter Dave Benton sings on “Ponies\,” the centerpiece of T
 race Mountains’ fourth full-length album Into the Burning Blue. Decorate
 d with retro textures and violet flowers\, the album begins with the crack
 le of a fire\, as if something is burning and hatching into a new form. As
  Benton grappled with the end of an 8-year romantic relationship\, songs w
 ere pouring out of him in quick succession\, often urgently before he had 
 logically processed the emotions himself. Collectively\, the songs are im
 bued with a spectrum of weighted emotions\, but the blue continued to burn
 \, with each song adopting its respective hue — a violet reclaiming of p
 assion\, a deep sea blue of sorrow\, the sky blue moments of relief and li
 beration when he comes up for air and sees hope on the horizon. The pressu
 re of this period crystallized Benton’s adventurous spirit and self-rene
 wal as he embraced new high-fidelity sounds and conviction. Writing routin
 ely over a Roland CR-68 drum machine and enamored with the dramatic precis
 ion of 80s music\, Benton enlisted Craig Hendrix (Japanese Breakfast) to b
 ring his indie rock to immersive new heights.Out of Hendrix’s Philadelph
 ia studio “The Well\,” the two employed synth-laden\, reverberating at
 mospheres that enter the frame like layers of supernatural silk. The end r
 esult is a pensive and playful collection of songs that gallop along Fleet
 wood Mac pop grooves with sharp melodies and signature 80s gated snare (á
  la Phil Collins). The album still tumbles through Benton’s endearing ob
 servations\, maintaining the candor that’s drawn people to his songwriti
 ng since his early work with indie rock band LVL UP.\n

 efining work of art\, is a certain ineffable\, increasingly rarified quali
 ty: unity of vision. Great songs need not announce their greatness: their 
 marriage of idea with action\, soul with sound\, appears as something whic
 h is naturally effortless\, unforced—they are what they are because they
  have no choice but to be. On Playing Favorites\, Sheer Mag’s third full
  length and first with Third Man Records\, this precise\, matured clarity 
 of vision is put on full display. Over the course of the past decade\, She
 er Mag have labored to carve out a discernibly singular position within th
 e canon of contemporary rock: toggling with ease between the refined flour
 ishes of a “connoisseur’s band” and the ecstatic colloquialism of po
 pulist songwriting—yet displaying no strict loyalty to either camp—the
 ir sound\, while oft-referenced\, is unmistakably and immediately recogniz
 able as theirs alone. With Playing Favorites\, Sheer Mag have capitalized 
 on a decade’s worth of devotion to their own collective spirit—a spiri
 t refined in both the sweaty trenches of punk warehouses and the larger-th
 an-life glamour of concert halls—emerging with a dense work of gripping 
 emotions\, massive hooks\, and masterfully constructed power-pop anthems. 
 This is the record the Philadelphian rock and roll four-piece has always b
 een destined to make.\nTHE OUTSECTThe members of The Out-Sect all met whil
 e living in a Philadelphia junkyard. On weekends\, they would gather to dr
 ink beers inside a broken down 1982 GMC Caballero with a copy of Back From
  The Grave stuck in the car’s cassette player. Instantly being drawn to 
 the trashy sounds of those pimple-faced mid-60s punks\, they figured they 
 could write a song half as good as any of them. And that’s just what the
 y did! Using instruments they found in the trash\, the band has managed to
  write a handful of deranged “songs” that will leave you asking yourse

 and lyrical\, threading backward through the time of Six Organs of Admitta
 nce. Almost marinating in it as a way of life. Working on the music and th
 e vocals\, then spending some time with them while steppin g away from the
 m. Walking the dog and coming back to them. Time is Glass is made of that 
 kind of time. Alone time. Recorded in the visceral environs of home\, Tim
 e is Glass is sharply focused\, even as misty impressionist mountains floa
 t through the background. Sweet and spiny\, “ The Mission ” sings its 
 purpose\, before turning abruptly to the orchestral rumble of “ Hephaest
 us ”: rural industrial psychedelia\, ecosystem goth\, synths arcing to l
 ift a helplessly earthbound community into the firmament above. Winding al
 most imperceptibly back into song with “ Slip Away ”\, the time of the
  record becomes clear\, moves fluidly\, relaxed but aware\, from event to 
 event. People and things coming around again. The intuit\, passing through
  wormholes and time\, sounding deep then dissolving into the universal. Th
 e acoustic sounds ringing\, layered suddenly\, then clear again. Explosion
 s of a new kind of distortion. Ecstatic melodies. Communing. The space of 
 a day. The space of a season. Time is Glass\, and Six Organs of Admittanc 
 e is here and will be here\, again.\nTASHI DORJITashi Dorji  is a Bhutane

 gether toward some new horizon.Momentum. Evolution. Expansion. Those are i
 mportant traits for a critically-acclaimed group that recently celebrated 
 its 15-year anniversary. “When you’ve been a band for as long as we ha
 ve\, there’s a lot of moving on\,” says Thomas Johnson. “We just kee
 p going\, because that’s how you keep things fresh. That’s how you kee
 p the spark.” By matching the sharply-written songs of three distinct fr
 ontmen with a progressive mix of rock & roll\, electrified folk\, and cosm
 ic American roots music\, Futurebirds have built an audience that’s as w
 ide as the band’s own sound. With Easy Company\, Futurebirds’ fifth st
 udio album\, that sound reaches a new peak.Featuring four songs apiece fro
 m singer/songwriters Womack\, Johnson\, and Carter King\, Easy Company fee
 ls like a celebration of the tight-knit bonds that have held Futurebirds a
 loft since 2008. Back then\, the guys were college students at the Univers
 ity of Georgia\, building a buzz around town with shows at fraternity hous
 es and local bars. Years later\, they’ve become headliners at bucket-lis
 t venues like The Ryman and The Fillmore\, collaborating with fellow genre
  benders like My Morning Jacket’s Carl Broemel along the way. They team 
 up with new partners on Easy Company\, which was recorded with producer Br
 ad Cook in the border town of Tornillo\, TX. The guest list includes Waxah
 atchee’s Katie Crutchfield\, who trades verses with King on the album’
 s title track\, and Drive-By Truckers co-founder Patterson\, who delivers 
 a spoken-word monologue during “Soft Drugs.” A brass section even make

 d by a band of brothers who’ve never sounded so invigorated. Easy compan
 y\, indeed.\n

  musical journey began in the vibrant port city of Sekondi-Takoradi\, in t
 he Western Region of Ghana. His early fascination with music blossomed int
 o a lifelong passion. From mastering his father’s flute at the tender ag
 e of eight\, to honing his guitar skills under the mentorship of “Uncle 
 Bonku”\, Sammy Lartey and Ebo Taylor\, Ambolley’s musical odyssey has 
 been nothing short of extraordinary. This all led to Ambolley becoming a m
 usical life force and exploding on the scene in 1973 with a jazzy highlife
  sound called ‘SIMIGWA-DO’. His name has become synonymous with Simigw
 a music and dance.Coming of age amidst the zenith of Ghana’s highlife er
 a\, Ambolley emerged as a pivotal figure in its evolution\, lending his ta
 lents to esteemed bands such as Houghas Extraordinaires\, Meridians Of Tem
 a and Ghana Broadcasting Band. It was during this time that he caught the 
 attention of his compatriot and friend\, Ebo Taylor\, who recruited Amboll
 ey to be a member of the Uhuru Dance Band. This all lead to a transformati
 ve journey to Nigeria in 1973\, where they shared the stage with the legen

 an highlife with soul and funk influences from across the Atlantic. With S
 imigwa\, Ambolley seized the opportunity to showcase his own musical prowe
