  – Show\nPILE (11:00 PM)\n \nPile is from Boston\, Massachusetts. Starte
 d as a solo project by Rick Maguire back in 2007\, Pile released ‘Demons
 tration\,’ a 10 song demo and ‘Jerk Routine’ in 2008 before expandin
 g their line-up. Wanting to be able to tour on the material with a band\, 
 Maguire attempted to find some other players. After some shuffling\, the b
 and found a cohesive line-up with Kris Kuss (drums)\, Matt Becker (guitar)
 \, Matt Connery (bass) and Maguire (guitar\, vocals). In the eight years s
 ince\, Pile has released several acclaimed albums\, ‘Magic isn’t Real
 ’ (2010)\, ‘Dripping’ (2012)\, ‘You’re Better Than This’ (2015
 )\, and “A Hairshirt of Purpose’ (2017)\, in addition to two highly so
 ught after EP’s and the ‘Odds and Ends’ (2018) collection. Becker an
 d Connery left the band in 2018 and Chappy Hull (guitar) and Alex Molini (
 bass) joined. They released their most recent album\, “Green and Gray\,
 ” in May of 2019. Since coming together as a full band in 2009\, Pile ha
 ve toured as much as their lives collectively allow\, playing nearly 1000 
 shows spread out over the US\, Canada\, the UK and Europe. \nMANEKA (10:0

 nWhat does “Old Blues” mean to you? For Bad History Month’s Sean Spr
 echer\, “Old Blues” is many things. The title of the Boston based musi
 cian’s sophomore album (since the dissolution of duo Fat History Month) 
 refers to “macro and micro scale Bad History\, childhood trauma dragged 
 into adulthood\, the self-doubts and anxieties of aging\, problems people 
 have been fighting wars over since the ancients\,” and most naturally\, 
 “the tradition of channeling hard times into good music.”\n

 – Doors8PM – Show\n \n \n \nMAN ON MAN\n \nMAN ON MAN (also M.O.M.) i
 s a new gay lover band made up of Joey Holman (HOLMAN) and Roddy Bottum (F
 aith No More\, Imperial Teen\, CRICKETS\, Nastie Band). Their upcoming sel
 f-titled record\, ​MAN ON MAN\,​ is infused with indie-rock distortion
  and soaked in gay pop confidence while still maintaining the acerbic and 
 pure sense of humor they both share. M.O.M.‘s music videos take their ma
 gical collaboration to another level with otherworldly cinematographic dim
 ension\, and of course\, the subversive playfulness of two gay lovers unmi
 stakably flirting with their audience and each other. Upon the release of 
 their debut single\, “Daddy”\, their video (chock full of the pair dan
 cing seductively in their white briefs) was removed from YouTube for viola
 ting their “sex and nudity policy.” At this moment\, the band solidifi
 ed their political visibility as queer artists who are not ok with being s
 ilenced or removed from history because of their age or size. Bottum told 
 Rolling Stone\, “​There’s enough representation in the gay communit
 y of young\, hairless pretty men.​” Roddy and Joey’s love for each 
 other and their own bodies\, histories\, and truths are what make this pro
 ject so tender and lovable.\nUGLI\n \n“FUCK. It’s an all-caps exclamat
 ion\, a sharp proclamation\, and a rallying cry. That’s also the name of
  the debut record from Philly/South Jersey quartet UgLi. Across eight trac
 ks that hearken back to gloom-doom 90s alt-rock and leap towards power-pop
  majesty\, FUCK is more than deserving of its title. The band promises a
  welcome release of tension that needs no introduction\, just your attenti
 on. Assembled over an uncertain 2020\, the record finds Dave Downham (Pet
  Symmetry\, mewithoutYou) and the band honing in on a sound that relishes 
 in being rough around the edges—anything else would betray UgLi’s inte
 rnal monologue. 2021’s UgLi—guitarist/vocalist Dylyn Durante (she/her
 )\, bassist Lucas Gisonti (he/him)\, guitarist Andrew Iannarelli (he/him)\
 , and drummer Teddy Paullin (he/him)—live in the tender space between dr
 eams and nightmares. Durante likens her emotional squalor to a “House Pe
 t” as the record begins\, lets her brain splay open over a flame through
  “Bad Egg\,” and finds ways to navigate love when Cupid’s arrows are
  pointed elsewhere twice in the runtime. These arty self-reflections are b
 oosted by a band that screeches and shouts alongside her\, leading to stan
 dout moments like “Superball\,” where a narrative of finding one’s p
 lace gets jumbled as punk-rock pacing scatters the map. There’s even roo
 m for the nine-minute orchestral splendor of closer “Naegleriasis\,” w
 here certain brain death is fought with swells of saxophone and trumpet. N
 o matter your entry point into UgLi’s charm\, you’ll certainly be sayi
 ng something\,” - James Cassar\n \n \n \n \n

 OUNG JESUS (8:00 PM)\n \nThe music of Young Jesus has always been about ch
 ange. Bandleader and sole original member John Rossiter is a restless spir
 it\, always moving\, always seeking new sounds\, new thoughts\, new method
 s of working. Young Jesus’ new album Shepherd Head is a dramatic departu
 re for the band\, delving deeper into the themes that have always fascinat
 ed Rossiter—love\, heartbreak\, God—approached in a completely new dir
 ection. It’s a record of growth and exploration\, pushing forward into t
 he future with hope while still holding the pain and regrets of the past\,
  seeking a balance for the present.\n \nYoung Jesus began when John Rossit
 er dropped out of college after doing acid with two of his high school fri
 ends and decided to join their band. After several albums\, he moved to L.
 A. with the intention of never playing music again. However\, the new envi
 ronment woke something up in Rossiter\, and he began to write music at a f
 urious pace\, recruiting a new band to explore this new evolution in sound
 . That time for Young Jesus was marked by experimentation and improvisatio
 n\, as the band toured and put out three records with Saddle Creek.\n \nA 
 few years later\, the band had drifted apart from too much time on the roa
 d\, and Rossiter became restless. After the tragic death of a close friend
 \, Rossiter felt a need for change. “I can be kind of a perfectionist an
 d a pretty intense band member\,” says Rossiter. “I drove the band rea
 lly hard for a while\, and I don’t think I realized how hard I was doing
  that. Everyone was just burnt out on me and on each other. And I think I 
 had wanted to reflect on that more\, why I did push so hard and why I coul
 d be so demanding and stubborn.”\n \n \n

 s gonna be the one whose mom called him ‘the Golden One\,’ right befor
 e she died.” This is where his debut HBO comedy special\, The Golden One
 \, finds Whitmer: age thirty\, investigating this sense (curse?) of destin
 y-as-identity. It’s been thirteen years since he left Alabama for LA\, b
 ecoming a linchpin for LA’s young\, independent comedy scene with Power 
 Violence\, the monthly show he hosted with friends. But he became haunted 
 by the question: had he already peaked\, just like his mom\, singer in a l
 ocal band with big ambitions that never made it out of the Flora-Bama Loun
 ge in Gulf Shores? Rather than shy away from all that messy self-mythology
 \, Whitmer tapped the source of it all through writing this one-man show f
 eaturing his own original music. Songs from The Golden One\, a companion a

 ynthesizing relatable-content: millennial anxieties\, therapy-speak jokes\
 , and the annals of his own childhood tragedies.\n \nAL MENNE (9:00 PM)\n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nSKULLCRUSHER \n \nHelen Ballenti
 ne has spent a lifetime understanding that she looks neither tough nor int
 ense. With wispy blond hair that suggests a wheat field during a radiant s
 ummer sunset\, and weighing less than the average high-school sophomore\, 
 she knows how first impressions tend to go—“sweet\, polite\, very quie
 t and even meek\, maybe smart\,” she summarizes. Ballentine laughs when 
 she recounts being flattened by a soccer ball in fifth grade or the family
  friends recently tickled by her band name\, Skullcrusher. How could someo
 ne so slight and soft\, they wondered\, wield something so heavy and aggre
 ssive? But listen even once to the five subversively rapturous tracks of S
 kullcrusher’s second EP\, Storm in Summer. You’ll instantly understand
  the dualities at play here—the light and the dark\, the harsh and the h
 eavenly\, the Skullcrusher and the seemingly soft-spoken songwriter. Balle
 ntine’s tunes ferry a subtle but unwavering intensity\, deserving of the
  very name they take.Storm in Summer was written entirely during the last 
 year\, as Ballentine watched with astonishment and some anxiety as listene
 rs parsed the words and feelings of her acclaimed self-titled debut.\nBABE
 HOVENMaya Bon\, the singer-songwriter behind Hudson\, New York’s Babehov
 en\, views light as one of life’s few fundamental truths. In times of pa
 in\, we often look to simple things we can rely on\, and light is as relia
 ble as they come. Babehoven’s first full-length album Light Moving Time 
 revolves around Bon’s view of life as a confusing\, jarring\, and kaleid
 oscopic experience filled with contradictions\, loss\, and change\, so it
 ’s no wonder Bon often looks to light — not so much for specific answe
 rs\, but as a pillar of continuity and a marker of time. Bon has built a s
 olid partnership with her musical collaborator and producer Ryan Albert ov
 er the last few years\, releasing several EPs since 2018. Their work displ
 ays Bon’s emotionally incisive approach to songwriting that draws just a
 s much power from abstract poetry that asks big questions as specific\, pe
 rsonal vignettes. Similarly\, Light Moving Time rests on lyrics that zoom 
 in and out\, inviting listeners to bring their own experiences to these so
 ngs when her writing is more cryptic and stew in the moments when Bon pres
 ents her entire heart on a platter.MALMal is the artist project of Los An
 geles-based visual artist and independent musician Mal Hauser. Hauser cont
 ributes vocals\, guitar\, synthesizer\, keyboards and percussion to their

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nLAZY EYES\n \nSongBook\, the debu
 t album by Sydney four-piece The Lazy Eyes\, is a world unto itself\, and 
 like every good fantasy world\, it abides by its own logic. Step inside: t
 he colours are a little brighter\; things move a little slower\, but they
 ’re liable to get inordinately faster in the blink of an eye. The landsc
 ape is all hard brick and plasterdust — stoner lurch and Sabbath-y chug 
 — until a hook bursts forth\, unexpected\, like a flower from concrete. 
 Suddenly you’re in a garden in full blossom\, and you didn’t even noti
 ce\; you walked a mile without taking a single step. SongBook is strange
  like that — all journey and all destination\, a decidedly modern marvel
  of psych-rock that’s unpretentious in construction but precious where i
 t counts. In SongBook’s earliest moments\, The Lazy Eyes welcome you to
  their technicolour\, sun-baked universe with open arms: “Can I show you
  all the places you can go\, on this island that I know? All the caves and
  allthe snow\, on the mountains there are goats.”\n \nThe floral brightn
 ess of The Lazy Eyes’ music belies their perfectly mundane origins. Harv
 ey Geraghty\, Itay Shachar and Noah Martin met in their early years at Syd
 ney’s Newtown High School of the Performing Arts. Bonding over a love of
  psych rock\, they banded together as a matter of both taste and necessity
 \, three of the only rhythm section musicians in a school filled largely w
 ith string\, brass and woodwind musicians. They became fast friends\, star
 ted jamming together\, and\, eventually\, began to busk around Sydney\, th
 eir burgeoning band (and friendship) being bound together by long hours pl
 aying and carting their instruments around the city. Around 2015\, as they
  began playing real gigs\, The Lazy Eyes decided to formalise the band as 
 a unit\, a decision that coincided neatly with their meeting of Leon Karag
 ic\, who provided much-needed bass to their ensemble and\, with his knowle
 dge of niche and underground music\, broadened the band’s stylistic and 
 ideological palette. “The biggest thing was that we were close friends f
 irst\, and then the bonus on top of that was that we had the same taste in
  music\, and felt really not weird or awkward about making music together\
 ,” recalls Itay. “We didn’t feel like we had to act a certain way ar
 ound each other\,” says Noah\, “We could just be ourselves\, and—”
  adds Harvey: “Freaky.”\n \nThe intimacy of The Lazy Eyes’ friendshi
 p is felt\, deeply\, in their music\, particularly in their renowned live 
 sets. In the years since they formed\, The Lazy Eyes have become emblemati
 c torchbearers for the Australian psych-rock scene\, accepting the baton f
 rom the iconic bands that first inspired their formation. Off the back of 
 their first two EPs\, released in 2020 and 2021\, The Lazy Eyes have sold 
 out numerous shows along Australia’s east coast\, including their own mu
 sic festival\, Lazyfest\; garnered praise from tastemaking outlets at home
  and abroad\, including Complex\, KCRW\, FBi Radio\, triple j Unearthed\, 
 BBC 6 Music and Radio 1\, and Spin\; been named an NME 100 band for 2021\;
  and more. The band’s reputation continues to grow\, despite the fact th
 at planned international jaunts at SXSW and The Great Escape were cancelle
 d in light of the Covid-19 pandemic\, a disappointing false start that non
 etheless proves the strength of the band’s self-recorded EPs.\n

  – Show\nTY SEGALL (Solo Acoustic)\nThe man in the tree has a guitar\, h
 e’s gonna sing. But the sun shining through the branches— are those ra
 ys yellow or hazy gray? What day is today? When are you not going to feel 
 this way again?\n“Hello\, Hi”: welcome in to a new room to play the st
 yles and feels that lie under Ty Segall’s fingers\, easing fresh air int
 o acoustic space with an assortment of love songs flowering in righteous u
 nconsciousness. Plaintive and wistful\, but unafraid. Like rain washing aw
 ay yesterday\, “Hello\, Hi” pushes open the door\, inviting the new to
  pass through all the old shades and degrees of hot and cold. Dark paths t
 urn off abruptly into absurd darkness\, then wind back through the broken 
 rocks\, ecstatic again. Absurdity again. It happens everyday.\n“Hello\, 
 Hi” is expansively rendered by Ty\, mostly by himself\, at home. The iso
 lation suits the songs: you’re only ever as “at home” as you are wit
 h yourself in the mirror. Ty’s acoustic and electric guitars and vocal h
 armonies layer self upon self\, forming a spiny backbone for the album. Te
 xtures at once gentle and dissonant root the songs as they make their move
 : melodic arcs convulsing in doubt and bliss and rage. Busting out of the 
 endless gridlock into open space\, these spirits pass on through.\n“Hell
 o\, Hi”’s flickering awakening to this trip: the opening three tracks
 ’ train of sweet and salty reflections\, before the abrupt crunch of the
  title track electrifies the senses. Good morning’s turned to good mourn
 ing in nothing flat\, but there’s still a way up from the doldrums\, to 
 try again. Why can’t it be just as simple as “Hello\, Hi”? What to d
 o with yourself when love triggers loathing? How many more times do you ha
 ve to go back there again? Pulling at the scratchy wool threads of an old 
 sweater favored for warmth\, comfort\, protection\, rejection\, denial\, b
 lindness etc\, Ty Segall dives from a clear\, open sky\, down through the 
 marine layer and the shimmering waves of all the years.\nRadiating from th
 e same mind fields as Goodbye Bread and Sleeper\, mixed with shard edges o
 f contrast and contradiction from things like Freedom’s Goblin\, Manipul
 ator\, and First Taste\, “Hello\, Hi” is Ty’s most relaxed and compl
 ete production to date\, an ebb-and flow fusion of words and music offerin
 g abstraction and acceptance as it wrestles itself through a fucked-up tim
 e. Your life and what you make of it — throughout “Hello\, Hi\,”
  Ty Segall charts a passage through its enduring tangles honestly\, with c
 larity and confusion. \nCHARLES MOOTHART“Losing Ground is the mutated b
 ridge that connects Soft Crime and Blood Machine. It is the piece that f
 astens the three songs together and outlines them as new visions. Original
 ly\, I thought of the riff for Losing Ground as a bridge in the song struc
 ture sense\, but when I took a step back I realized it had the potential t
 o be a structure of its own. It is one of the more vulnerable tracks I hav
 e made with the vocals pretty far out front. I wanted it to feel hopefully
  battered. Looking up from the floor with feelings of intention and unders
 tanding.”\n\n

  – Show\nJOCKSTRAP (10:00 PM)\nJockstrap formed in 2017 after Georgia (a
 lso of Black Country\, New Road) met Taylor at the Guildhall School Of Mus
 ic & Drama where they were studying jazz and electronic composition respec
 tively. Generally speaking their modus operandi has been to produce a viol
 ently spatially and temporally disrupted form of pop music which sometimes
  sees them gleefully break apart existing styles only to expertly reassemb
 le them and other times sees them mint entirely fresh genres. Both of them
  grew up playing and loving classical music and picked up a bug for jazz i
 n college\, but their other shared interests include Disclosure and Mica L
 evi\, with Taylor having a penchant for Bob Dylan\, and Georgia for Joni M
 itchell. They have released a clutch of singles\, EPs and a mixtape over t
 he last five years\, already giving rise to something of a press narrative
 : Georgia sings a classic pre-rock & roll orchestral lounge pop song while
  Taylor forces it through a post-dubstep blender\, mixing old with new.\nB
 ut their debut LP\, I Love You Jennifer B\, blasts that simplistic reducti
 onism to smithereens. Releasing in the Fall of 2022\, Georgia and Taylor s
 aid: “I Love You Jennifer B is a collection of Jockstrap tracks that hav
 e been 3 years in the making. Everything on it is pretty singular sounding
  so we hope there is a track on there for everyone and something that spea
 ks to you and says ‘I’m a banger.’”\nMuch has been made recently o
 f the resurgence in interest in the song ‘Running Up That Hill (A Deal W
 ith God)’ via its appearance on the Stranger Things 4 soundtrack but Joc
 kstrap are the only young artists in the UK (both are 24) who currently ha

 Kate Bush had during the mid-80s. Jockstrap effortlessly capture the chaos

 n experimental and hard rock band ephemerally founded by Judson Kolk and B
 ruce Ebersole when they were eight and eleven years old. Since then they
 ’ve experimented with quite a few different styles and have had several 
 incarnations of the band. The current cast consists of: David Mcfaul (voca
 ls\, keys)\, Von Kolk (flute\, guitar\, vocals)\, Bruce Ebersole (guitar)\
 , Sam Pickard (drums)\, Jan Fantana (bass) and Judson Kolk (vocals\, guita
 r). The band is known for their ecstatic live performances\, serendipitous
  visual make-believe\, and gritty gut dials. Delve into the fervencies of 
 their sword-like barrage.\nTOMATO FLOWER\nTomato Flower is the result of l
 ong-lasting friendships and overlapping collaborations that found Austyn W
 ohlers\, Mike Alfieri\, and Jamison Murphy (and later adding bassist Ruby 
 Mars) looking for the balance between taut guitars and experimental pop mu
 sic. The Baltimore-based quartet melds irresistible melodies with rhythmic
  trickery and unexpected structures\, bending genre at will. Math rock\, d
 ub\, and bossa might flash by well before the outro. Formal constraint bec
 omes an opportunity for play and surprise\; the pop form becomes a psyched
 elic capsule.\n \n \nTURBO WORLD\n\n \nTurbo World is the sunny and shady 
 brainchild of co-conspirators Stephe Cooper and Caroline Bennett. Best kno
 wn as the mastermind behind avant-prog boppers Cloud Becomes Your Hand and
  a member of Guerilla Toss\, Cooper continues to stand out for his madcap 
 compositions that embody the spirit and ethos of avant rock groups Aksak M
 aboul & Slapp Happy. Joining forces with Bennett\, the manic scribe\, sing
 er\, and multimedia wizard of digital hardcore duo Stice\, their debut alb
 um\, My Challenger\, is an experimental prog-opera that leads listeners o
 n a surreal\, animated jaunt through the world of organized crime. The alb
 um’s north star is Joey the Hitman aka Max Kurschner\, whose 1973 interv
 iew on The David Susskind Show\, forever immortalized on YouTube\, serves 
 as inspiration and source material. They are joined live by Ryan Power\, J
 ake Lichter (Stice)\, and Calvin Grad (Big French).\nKOLB\nA classically t
 rained opera singer who spurned opera for lo-fi pop\, an indie-rocker\, an
 d an experimental saxophonist walk into a karaoke bar. \nThis isn’t a jo
 ke set-up. It’s the origin story of Tyrannical Vibes\, the playful\, de
 ceptively brilliant new album from Kolb—a.k.a. Brooklyn-based songwriter
  Mike Kolb—with a little help from his friends\, vocalists Carolyn Hiett

 Shimmer\, Fire Roast). After spending four years as a touring member of th
 e electro-pop duo Water From Your Eyes\, all the while self-releasing the 
 occasional EP or tape\, Kolb is properly introducing himself as a solo art

 t’s the best one he’s made so far and I think you should check it out.
  He’s a super funny and sensitive person and I think he lets those quali

 ’t worry! It still rocks when it’s supposed to. The layers are always 
 revealed in multiple listens to Dom’s stuff. For somebody who’s been a
 round as much as he has\, he’s just a really self-effacing and unpretent

 PM – Show\nAOIFFE NESSA FRANCES\nIn spring of 2020\, Aoife Nessa Frances
  moved out of the city for the first time in her life. After packing up he
 r things in Dublin\, she moved to rural County Clare on the west coast of 
 Ireland\, and there\, amidst the stillness\, she worked on the songs that 
 would become her second album\, Protector. The resulting body of work deft
 ly juxtaposes golden hours and arguments\, affection and alienation\, and 
 above all marks a crucial period of her life that was transformative and l
 eft her wiser.\n \n“I might have been running away from my problems\,”
  she admits. “I was disconnected from myself and from nature\, but I fou
 nd peace far away from the city\, where there were no distractions. I isol
 ated myself with nothing to do but make music.” Writing Protector provid
 ed Frances an essential sounding board for this journey. “I felt a growi
 ng inner strength that guided me through the making of this album. It was 
 like sculpting with my eyes closed\, this intense sense of self-preservati
 on leading me and growing with each song I wrote. When I started\, I didn
 ’t recognise myself. With each song\, I became more human.”\n \nAoife 
 spent that summer with her dad and two sisters. “It was a very special t
 ime for my family as we had never been that tight knit before\,” she say
 s\, “and we all became very close…driving the country roads and swimmi
 ng in the Atlantic Ocean and lakes of Clare. I had one CD in my car: Jim S
 ullivan’s UFO and we listened to it over and over again.” Like many pe
 ople in their late twenties shaking off youthful rebelliousness\, Frances 
 experienced a solidification of familial ties like never before\, and felt
  the formation of a protective\, impenetrable shell. “For me\, Protector
  acknowledges the part of myself that steers me towards a brighter path. T
 he almost psychotropic power of nature gave me a connection I never felt b
 efore. As the countryside seeped into me and lines of communication opened
  up with my family\, I developed an ability to perceive myself and my choi
 ces within an expanded world.”\nINDIGO SPARKE\n \n“To be at the edge\,
  at the precipice of anything\, requires deep surrender. It’s like dying
  over and over again. In the tidal throes of life at its fullest and most 
 intense is the space where grace and strength is fortified and cultivated\
 , is what I am learning” Indigo Sparke ruminates on her magnetic second 
 full-length album Hysteria\, a huge and beautiful sweeping work\, one that
  possesses a rare\, reflective power. From the first few notes\, in the fi
 rst song\, Blue\, something chilling and captivating pierces straight into
  the listener’s chest. With harmonies reminiscent of the voices in our h
 eads\, she examines love\, loss\, grief\, a newly realized rage\, her hist

  – Show\nDELICATE STEVE\n“I’ve spent most of my life trying to escap
 e the sound of the electric guitar\,” says Steve Marion. That’s a rath
 er surprising confession considering that\, under the name Delicate Steve\
 , Marion has spent the better part of the last decade establishing himself
  as one of the most wildly innovative and widely revered players in the ga
 me. He’s recorded with Paul Simon\, been sampled by Kanye West\, toured 
 in the Black Keys\, and released four critically acclaimed albums of genre
 -bending instrumental music. He’s your favorite musician’s favorite mu
 sician\, a virtuoso songwriter\, producer\, and performer who occupies a l
 ane entirely his own in the modern indie landscape\, but he’s never like
 d the sound of the electric guitar? “I’ve tried everything under the s
 un to get away from it\,” he explains. “Until now.”\n \n \n \nWritt
 en and recorded on a 1966 Fender Stratocaster that reignited his love for 
 the instrument\, Delicate Steve’s captivating new album\, After Hours\, 
 marks a first for Marion\, an earnest\, easygoing collection that revels i
 n the simple joys of plugging in and playing. The songs are sweet and bree
 zy here\, pairing vintage soul grooves with mesmerizing\, wordless melodie
 s\, and Marion’s production work is suitably subtle and restrained\, ste
 pping back in all the right places to let the album’s masterful performa
 nces speak for themselves. In another first\, Marion teamed up with outsid
 e musicians on the record\, bringing in a group of all-star players includ
 ing renowned bassist Shahzad Ismaily (Yoko Ono\, Marc Ribot) and famed Bra
 zilian percussionist Mauro Refosco (David Byrne\, Atoms For Peace) to help
  flesh out the arrangements and stretch his sonic boundaries. The result i
 s Marion’s warmest\, most magnetic work to date\, an inviting\, immediat
 ely accessible album that manages to balance thoughtful introspection and 
 carefree bliss in equal measure.\n

 like Christopher Cross and Donald Fagen\, but with a lo-fi spark. (They’
 ve embraced the label “smooth-fi.”) The group was formed in Philadelph
 ia by singer/multi-instrumentalists Thomas Crystal and Benjamin Louisiana.
  They self-released Work Drugs’ full-length debut\, Summer Blood\, in mi
 d-2011 before partnering with Chicago-based Bobby Cahn Records\, which rel
 eased a flurry of records that followed. After the song “Rad Racer” fr
 om their debut was featured in a commercial for Urban Outfitters later tha
 t summer\, their second album\, Aurora Lies\, came out in November. A set 
 of acoustic versions of existing songs\, Cayman Islands Sessions\, arrived
  before the end of the year. In 2012\, they released both Absolute Bearing
  and Delta\, with the Amore EP following in February 2013. Another full-le
 ngth set\, Mavericks\, appeared that summer. Still with Bobby Cahn Records
 \, their sixth LP of original material\, Insurgents\, arrived in March 201
 4\, with Runaways on its heels that fall and Cayman Islands Sessions\, Vol
 . 2 in December. In the meantime\, Work Drugs maintained a regular touring
  schedule\, usually with an expanded lineup\, earning support slots for ba
 nds spanning Two Door Cinema Club\, Peter Bjorn and John\, Umphrey’s McG
 ee\, and Battles\, to name a few. Still sporting a tranquil\, yacht-side v

 ded Method Acting\, which was released in August 2016. Preceded by the sin

 ng Crying Monkey Film Festival though ultimately not taking the final priz

 of work has resonated deeply with these seemingly disparate milieus. Her m
 usic has straddled the folk\, americana and indie rock genres over the cou

  processing the intimacies of life in song has struck a chord with those l
 isteners who crave authenticity and depth.\n \nChris’s elegant emotional
 ity as a vocalist and her flair as a lyricist have garnered her favorable 
 comparisons to Chan Marshall\, Bruce Springsteen\, and Patty Griffin. Over
  many years of touring on both sides of the Atlantic\, she has shared the 
 stage with such diverse and esteemed artists as The Lumineers\, Gregory Al
 an Isakov\, The Cowboy Junkies\, Haley Heynderickx\, and Ani DiFranco. She
  has had her songs featured on such television shows as Brothers and Siste
 rs\, Covert Affairs and Shameless and well as a song featured in the Sunda
 nce featured indie film\, The Royal Road. Along the way\, Chris has remain
 ed truly independent\, selling nearly 50\,000 albums through her own label
 \, Sad Rabbit Records.\nJOHN-ALLISON WEISSKnown for their gritty\, melodic
  indie pop songwriting\, John-Allison Weiss emerged at the end of the 2000
 s as an early crowd-funding hero with a strong D.I.Y. ethos that has defin
 ed them throughout their career. After establishing themselves among the p
 unk underground\, they became a staple of the Warped Tour and released hig
 hly rated albums like 2013’s Say What You Mean and 2015’s New Love. To
 uring with everyone from Lou Reed to Letters to Cleo\, Weiss has also coll
 aborated as a songwriter with artists including Tegan Quin and Kevin Devin

 0 PM)\nBarney Cortez continues his prolific output with the new LP\, “Hu
 llabaloo” on now La Reserve Records. After five EPs since 2018\, this is
  his first full-length album\, and the wait was worth it. Cortez is a bit 
 of a shapeshifter when it comes to songwriting\, and Hullabaloo finds him 
 drifting in and out of various eras while still retaining the melodic\, ho
 ok-driven sound his fans have come to expect. From the frantic title track
  to the lush and thoughtful psych rock of “Into The Void\,” you can he
 ar traces of 60s folk\, early Bowie\, grunge and even unabashed pop (“Pr
 otein”). His music has been featured on playlists such as Spotify’s 
 “Alternarock”\, “Fresh Folk”\, Apple’s “New In Indie”\, “P
 eak Indie” and “Breaking Rock”. \n \nHullabaloo” was produced by 
 Cortez and Shane Woods (Mo Lowda) at Headroom Studios (Alex G\, Hop Along\
 , Dr. Dog) during the winter of 2021 and features ATO recording artist Ray

  Gene Ween\, Bernie Worrell\, and many more. \nYELLOW SHOOTS  (8:30 PM)\
 nPhiladelphia-bred multi-instrumentalist and producer\, Yellow Shoots (Gre
 gory Matthews) is a musical polymath and alt-soul force informed by life a

 idized sound that melds r&b\, rock\, psychedelia and alternative soul\, Ye
 llow Shoots brings an invigorating presence to the stage that has been des

  – Show\nKIDS RETURN\nKids Return is first and foremost a great story of
  friendship between Adrien Rozé and Clément Savoye. It was in Paris\, at
  the age of 13\, that the two musicians met. Like Japanese director Takesh
 i Kitano’s film from which it takes its name\, the French duo’s projec
 t explores the depth within the false naivety of childhood\, and the evoca
 tive power of nostalgia when it blurs the line between joy and sadness.\n 
 \nKids Return’s sound sits somewhere between the Mamas and the Papas’ 
 Californian pop\, Vladimir Cosma’s orchestrations and the modesty of Joe
  Hisaishi’s soundtracks. It draws on Blur’s energy and MGMT’s vocal 
 harmonies\, while revisiting these Anglo-Saxon influences with the precisi
 on and delicacy of bands like Air. The result is a romantic and melancholi
 c melody\, a laboratory of emotions that can be thought of in pictures.\n 
 \nKids Return is also\, at a time when music is essentially produced on co
 mputer\, the choice of an organic\, ample and living sound. With their ana
 logical gears\, which they like to see as children’s toys\, in the manne
 r of François de Roubaix\, Clément and Adrien compose\, produce and writ
 e together. It is between their small Parisian studio and a house suspende
 d between the mountains of the Pyrenees that their pieces are born\, then 
 orchestrated by a string quartet in the countryside. From this journey eme
 rged a dreamlike and sensory music\, a call to dream\, an invitation to ex
 tract oneself from time.\n

 ing vocals paired with frontman Dara Kiely’s witty\, mundane and often s
 urrealist lyrics create ‘as perfect an expression of rock’n’roll’s
  essential auto-destructive impulse as this writers ever heard.’(The Gua
 rdian). Trailblazers for modern Irish alternative music and known for thei
 r ferocious live shows which have been described as chaotic\, electrifying
  and ‘genuinely dangerous\, like one last rave before the apocalypse’\
 , Gilla Band are not just a band\, but a force. In 2015 they signed to Rou
 gh Trade Records and let loose their debut album Holding Hands With Jamie 
 to rampant critical acclaim\, and topping this was to be no easy feat\, bu
 t following a 4 year hiatus\, they returned in September with their second
  studio album\, The Talkies\, heralded as ‘one of the biggest comebacks 
 of the year ‘ (Mary Anne Hobbs\, 6Music). The Press landscape hailed it 
 as ‘more abstract and more focused than their debut’ with outstanding 
 reviews from the likes of Crack Magazine (9/10)\,The Irish Times (5*) and 
 Record Collector(5/5). The Talkies was Recorded in November 2018 at Ballin
 tubbert House\, Ireland–the alien construction of the house and its corr
 idors help to navigate their cataclysmic sound within a world of its own. 
 And this enigmatic manor became Gilla Band’s sonic playground. It is an 
 album which is living and breathing\, in a continual state of metamorphosi
 s\, and it encompasses everything there is to love about the Dublin 4-piec
 e while simultaneously instilling an exciting level of discomfort. Their t

 ors\n8PM – Show\nQUASI\nBreaking the Balls of History is Quasi’s tenth
  record\, landing ten years after their last record\, on February tenth. T
 hree tens\, which aligns with the thirty years they’ve played together. 
 Sam Coomes and Janet Weiss have become Pacific Northwest icons\, and Quasi
  has always felt so steadfast— their enduring friendship so generative\,
  their energy infinite\, each album more raucous and catchy and ferocious 
 and funny than the last. But we were wrong to ever take Quasi for granted.
  For a while\, they thought 2013’s intricate Mole City might be their la
 st record. They’d go out on a great one and move on. Then in August 2019
  a car smashed into Janet’s and broke both legs and her collarbone. Then
  a deadly virus collided with all of us\, and no one knew when or if live 
 music as we knew it—the touring\, the communal crowds\, the sonic church
  of the dark club—would ever happen again. “There’s no investing in 
 the future anymore\,” Janet realized. “The future is now. Do it now if
  you want to do it. Don’t put it off. All those things you only realize 
 when it’s almost too late. It could be gone in a second.”Under lockdow
 n\, Portland’s streets fell still\, airplanes vanished\, wildlife emerge
 d. And with the obliterated normal came an unexpected gift: uninterrupted 
 time\, hours every day\, to make art. Quasi couldn’t go on the road\, so
  they got an idea: they would act as if they were on tour and play togethe
 r every single day. Each afternoon\, Sam and Janet bunkered down in their 
 tinypractice space and channeled the bewilderment and absurdity of this al
 ien new world into songs. Janet’s strength returned and rose to athlete-
 level stamina. “When you’re younger and in a band\, you make records b
 ecause that’s what you do\,” Sam said. “But this time\, the whole th
 ing felt purposeful in a way that was unique to the circumstances.” They
  knew they would keep it to just the two of them playing together in a roo
 m. They knew they’d record the songs live and together\, to capture a mo
 ment.The incredible result of those sessions is Breaking the Balls of Hist
 ory\, recorded in five days and produced by John Goodmanson at the legenda
 ry Robert Lang Studios in Shoreline\, WA. Here are two artists at their pr
 ime\, each a human library of musical knowledge and experience\, entirely 
 distinctive in their songcraft and sound. In Quasi-form\, the band becomes
  alchemically even greater than the sum of its parts: Janet’s galloping 
 drums and Sam’s punk-symphonic Rocksichord and their intertwining vocals
  make something gigantic\, anthemic.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nKING TUFF\n \nThere are times in 
 our life when we feel magic in the air. When new love arrives\, or we find
 ourselves lost in a moment of creation with others who share our vision. A
  sense that: this iswho I want to be. This is what I want to share.It’s 
 a fleeting feeling and one that Kyle Thomas\, the singer-songwriter who re
 cords andperforms as King Tuff\, found himself longing for in the spring o
 f 2020.But knowing he couldn’t simply recreate this time in his life at 
 will\, Thomas—who hails fromBrattleboro\, Vermont—set out to write a l
 ove letter to those cherished moments of inspirationand to the small town 
 that formed him. The one where he first nurtured his songwritingimpulses\,
  bouncing ideas off other like-minded artists. The kind of place where the
  changing ofthe seasons always delivered a sense of perspective and fresh 
 artistic inspiration. Where he felta deeper connection with nature and sen
 se of community that had once been so close at hand.\n \n“I wanted to ma
 ke an album to remind myselfthat life is magical\,” he reflects.And so\,
  Thomas seized upon his memories\, creating what he calls “an album abou
 t love andnature and youth.”The result isSmalltown Stardust\, a spiritua
 l\, tender and ultimately joyous record that mightcome as a shock to those
  with only a passing knowledge of the artist’s back catalog. OnSmalltown
  Stardust\, Thomas takes us on his journey to a place where past and prese
 nt collide\,where he can be a dreamer in love with all that he sees. Image
 s of his youth abound: fromRoute 91 which runs through his hometown (in 
 “Smalltown Stardust”)\; to Redtooth\, a spectrewho used to roam the st
 reets (“Bandits Of Blue Sky”)\; to old friends\, old haunts and old dr
 eams(“Always Find Me”)\; to Vermont’s Rock River\, which gave its na

 and we can’t rewind/ Cuz people grow and placeschange/ But my love for y

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nWESTERMAN\n \nUK artist Westerman
  returns with his first offering in two years with the song “Idol\; RE-r
 un” out via Partisan Records. The new track\,produced by James Krivcheni
 a and Westerman\,juxtaposes gentle and celestial sonics with an aggrieved 
 disposition and features artwork by renownedNew York via Portugal Graphic 
 Designer and Illustrator Bráulio Amado. The song was written after Wester
 man emergedfrom a period of disenchantment with making music\, and with th
 e future of his career feeling abstract\, it seemed unclear to Westerman w
 hether the material he was recording would ever be heard. Creatively\, thi
 s offered a strange kind of freedom\, and accommodated some of the most ad
 venturous and unselfconscious songwriting of his career. Finding textures 
 became a central concern taking programming and looping into his own hands
  in a way he never had before\, creating polyrhythmic grooves to lend urge
 ncy to his inner dialogue.”Idol\; RE-run” is the first taste of songs 
 written in this period and provides a hint for what’s to come from Weste
 rman in the coming year. The track featuresJames Krivchenia\, Mikel Patric
 k Avery and Booker Stardrum on drums\, Ben Reed on bass\, Luke Temple on s
 ynth\, Mat Davidson on piano\, Robin Eubanks on the trombone and of course
  Westerman on vocals\, guitar and synth.Speaking about the new song\, West
 erman shares:”The lyrics to the song were written around the same time a
 s the storming of the Capitol. The compulsion towards the pedestal is stro
 ng. The need to scapegoat and revere without logic. Our populists actively
  celebrate their being people who don’t know anything other or better th
 an anyone else\, yet these spectres with their failings conduct our anger 
 and resentment as if they were gods. They are nothing more than the shadow
  of something else\, the face fronting a need to be loved or revered prese
 nt in everyone. And there will always be another face to front.”\n
