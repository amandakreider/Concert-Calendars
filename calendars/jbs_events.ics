 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nALEX LAHEY\n \n“Living in a wor
 ld that wasn’t made for you makes you pretty strong and adaptive\, and y
 ou find the fun in it\,” says Alex Lahey. “It also makes you realize h
 ow absurd everything is. With ‘The Answer Is Always Yes\,’ I wanted to
  get weird because the world is weird\, and it’s even weirder when you r
 ealize you don’t fit into it all the time.” It’s no secret that the
  world wasn’t built with most people in mind. For those who exist on the
  fringe\, you learn to pave your own way\, foster your own community\, and
  create your own joy. As a queer person and a daughter of migrants\, Lahey
  learned how to adapt to a world that wasn’t made for her\, and her thir
 d album\, The Answer Is Always Yes\, examines how she finds comfort in the
  discomfort\, whether it’s reveling in absurdity or turning towards expl
 oration. Lahey’s debut album I Love You Like a Brother and its 2019 foll
 ow-up The Best of Luck Club take their focus from the lens of relationship
 s\, but with The Answer Is Always Yes\, Lahey analyzes her otherness throu
 gh different lenses\, from its isolating effect to the surrealism and humo
 r it instills.\n \n \n \nLIZA ANNE\n \nIndie rock sensation Liza Anne dis
 covered songwriting as a young girl at summer camp\, during a guitar lesso
 n workshop. Inspired\, from that moment forward she added melodies for her
  poetry and prose. As a teenager\, she followed the thread of her love for
  music from quiet Saint Simons Island\, GA\, where she was raised\, to Nas
 hville to attend Belmont University\, during which time she self-released 
 two albums that now boast over 50 million streams.\n

  almost in passing\, a feeling of being in-between things. I was really mo
 bile at that time\, living wherever. Half the songs came through in a week
 . “Jordan” perhaps the most out of the blue… sitting there as I was 
 on my brother’s couch in Austin. But I guess I don’t think that anythi
 ng comes from nowhere. Everything is writing to me. A grad professor once 
 told me that masturbation is writing\, as long as you’re looking out a w
 indow.\nI had just discovered\, late\, Raymond Carver Broadcast\, Sibylle 
 Baier (which “Tonight” is more or less dedicated to)\, Annette Peacock
 \, Richard & Linda Thompson\, a short story called “Car Crash While Hitc
 hhiking” by Denis Johnson. I had “Heart Needs a Home” in mind\, “T
 he Great Valerio\;” I was just really moving through the world\, hanging
  in the shadows of the people I wanted to be. Hoping\, looking out\, this 
 is Optimism. I was looking for anything.\nIn 2018\, I took these ten songs
  into a studio in Austin with some members of the band Knife in the Water.
  I’d been singing with them at the time and it felt right. My friend Ian
 \, who I’d been performing with as a duo for a few years\, was with me o
 n drums. “Friends Again” and “Jordan” were written in the process.
  “Jordan” was such an outlier\, I thought: I can’t put this on the a
 lbum. Then at some point in the recording process\, decided to embrace it
 —the question of whether spiritual themes should be a part of my work—
 which wouldn’t even be a question now. It’s in everything. But at the 
 time\, you know\, it was the first time\, and so the song kind of scared m
 e\, like I was a mule for it instead of its owner.\nNINA RYSERNina Ryser i

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nSURPRISE CHEF\n \nSurprise Chef
 ’s music is based on evoking mood\; their vivid arrangements utilize tim
 e and space to build soundscapes that invite the listener into their world
 . The quintet’s distinct sound pulls from 70s film scores\, the funkier 
 side of jazz\, and the samples that form the foundation of hip hop. They p
 ush the boundaries of instrumental soul and funk with their own approach h
 oned by countless hours in the studio\, studying the masters\, and perhaps
  most importantly\, the ‘tyranny of distance’ that dictates a unique p
 erspective to their music. Hailing from just outside of Melbourne\, Austra
 lia\, their first two albums\, All News Is Good News and Daylight Savings 
 amassed a die-hard fanbase and brought their sound from their home studio 
 to every corner of the globe. The band is now signed to Big Crown Records\
 , joining a lineage of contemporary and classic sounds that have influence
 d Surprise Chef’s music since their formation in2017. Surprise Chef is L
 achlan Stuckey on guitar\, Jethro Curtin on keys\, Carl Lindeberg on bass\
 , AndrewCongues on drums\, and Hudson Whitlock—the latest member who doe
 s it all from percussion to composing to producing. Their self proclaimed 
 “moody shades of instrumental jazz-funk” have a bit of everything: pun
 chy drums\, infectious keys\, rhythm guitar you might hear on a Studio One
  record\, and flute lines that could be from a Blue Note session. But when
  you step back and take in the entirety of their sound and approach\, you
 ’ll hear and see a group greater than the sum of its parts.\nALANNA ROYA

 8PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nSTUCK\n \nWorking at a mixing bo
 ard one night\, a catchphrase popped into Greg Obis’ head: “freak freq
 uency.” He was ringing out feedback during his job as a sound engineer\,
  and started to picture the parallels between acoustic physics and politic
 al trends. “If you think about a waveform\, as the frequency rises\, the
  space between the sine waves gets less and less\,” Obis explains. “Wi
 th that downward trend comes constant heightening\, stress and tension.”
  He came to see freak frequency as an apt metaphor for the decline of West
 ern empire\, an inverse relationship between the (positive) deterioration 
 of American hegemony and the (negative) worsening of daily life under that
  fall. It was a fitting title for the new material Obis was planning for S
 tuck\, the frenetic and twisted post-punk outfit he formed in 2018. Inspir
 ed by the doomy social economics of Mark Fisher’s Capitalist Realism\, t
 he bleak worldbuilding of horror games Demon’s Souls and Bloodborne\, an
 d the bombastic yet arty satire of Devo\, Obis channeled his audio analogy
  into Freak Frequency\, an album ringing out with explosive sounds and ide
 as. Though its songs tackle the violence of wealth\, the nightmares of tec
 hnocracy\, and the rise of the conspiratorial layman\, Freak Frequency is 
 Stuck’s quirkiest record to date—compositionally challenging and equip
 ped with menace\, yet dotted with vibrant fun. “Being in a brooding post
 -punk band isn’t that appealing to me\,” jokes Obis. “When things ar
 e bad\, all you can really do is laugh.”\n \n \n \nMESH\n \nPhiladelphi

 s\, drum samples & loops were produced on an all black MPC1000 except\, 
 “Fragmented Pulse” which used the classic DR-55 with an 8/12 bitcrushe

 ittle horse makes thrilling and wildly unpredictable songs that are a refl
 ection of the joys that come with making music with your best friends. The
  Pittsburgh quartet’s sophomore album\, Girl with Fish\, which is out Ju
 ne 9 via Saddle Creek\, was made focusing on intuition over intention: let
 ting the magic of collaboration come first. “Anything that makes us laug
 h or puts a smile on our faces\, we usually end up keeping in the songs\,
 ” explains drummer Jake Kelley. Across 11 self-recorded and self-produce
 d tracks\, the band careens from blissed-out pop to harsh noise\, glitchy 
 programmed drum beats\, and off-kilter indie rock—sometimes all in one s
 ong. As a follow-up to their critically acclaimed 2021 debut Hayday\, this
  LP\, with its overwhelmingly inviting and emotionally resonant tracklist\
 , is a document of four people trusting their instincts and most important
 ly each other.\nFULL BODY 2\n \nWith Full Body 2\, you are on a mission of
  truth. Take a journey into a virtual world where anything is possible and
  nothing is as it appears. Fight your way through contaminated levels of c
 yberspace as you take on and eliminate enemies\, and unlock codes that wil
 l allow you to gate travel to even more environments — all in a desperat
 e attempt to discover who or what’s behind The World. “Sounds like a 
 possessed Sega Dreamcast sound processor” – glaiveyyy\, bandcamp userJ

 TRY WESTERN\nA Country Western is a four piece guitar rock band from Phila
 delphia. A blurry blend of rock in a melancholy lull\, their songs seem t
 o only be on the brink of consciousness. Downtempo beats\, distorted vocal
 s\, and drowsy guitars obscure their minimalist lyrics that mimic the half
 -formed thoughts you have right before falling asleep. (quoted Sam Sulliva

  in spring of 1991. Comprised of bassist and vocalist Chris Murphy\, guita

  are so many moments peppered throughout the 30-year history of Canadian i

 fizzy\, fuzzed out guitars\, right up to later efforts that contain multit

 thing cozier\, though no less rousing. The core trio of Carmen Perry\, Cat
 herine Dwyer\, and Jack Washburn have always kept up active home recording
  practices for their solo projects–Carmen as Addie Pray\, Catherine as S
 pring Onion\, Jack under his own name–and here we find them gently foldi
 ng sounds sprung from their bedrooms into their signature brand of basemen
 t rock. Absent a dedicated drummer for the first time in their recorded hi
 story\, the band opts for simple drum machine accompaniment\, lending the 
 music a fresh weightlessness even as Carmen’s arresting vocals and sharp
  lyrics bring gravity in all their righteous anger\, scathing self-reproac
 h\, and disarming tenderness. Musically\, all the thrilling guitar riffs a
 nd grooving bass lines we’ve come to expect are here\, but the gradual r
 ecording process offered the band more opportunity to explore and experime
 nt\, adding on subtle layers of instrumentation\, distortion\, and electro
 nics\, and with them a warm sense of depth. In all\, Leap Dayis a short an
 d sweet\, loose but confident affair\; at once a reminder of Remember Spor
 ts’ absolute mastery of the pop rock anthem and a tantalizing sip from t
 he well of ideas they have yet to plumb.\n2ND GRADEFor Peter Gill (Friends
 hip\, Free Cake For Every Creature)\, the fearless leader of Philadelphia 
 power-pop group 2nd Grade\, being our full\, open selves means we can be a
 s sincere as we are sarcastic. New album Hit To Hit is about wearing your 
 heart on your sleeve but at arm’s length. It’s about being both earnes
 t and ironic. It’s playing with different selves yet managing to coalesc
 e them into one identity\; a self-aware and self-reflexive identity that m
 akes the characters concocted by Gill amusing\, relatable and insightfully
  authentic.\n

  New Jersey. What started as front woman Sarah Holt’s diaristic solo pro

 . Described as “Breeders meets Liz Phair to go to lunch with Pavement\,
 ” the band pairs nuanced narratives with dynamic arrangements. \n \n \
 n \nDedicated to doing-it-themselves\, their first full band EP\, Good Ol
  Boys\, was recorded and mixed by the band in their homes over the course 
 of 2019. The EP topped the local college radio charts and led them to open
  for Faye Webster that year. Molly Ringworm released their latest EP\, Se

 -control of their chaos. The EP was ritten in the wake of FUCK’s unexpec
 ted momentum\, which stirred up new thoughts and feelings in Durante and h
 er bandmates. UgLi’s latest is nothing if not loud\, unapologetic\, and 
 unafraid. But UgLi’s music is about more than making an expressive\, emo

 s the motto for Speedy Ortiz’s dauntless new collection of songs\, Twerp
  Verse. The follow-up to 2015’s Foil Deer\, the band’s latest indie ro
 ck missive is prompted by a tidal wave of voices\, no longer silent on the
  hurt they’ve endured from society’s margins. But like many of these t
 ruth-tellers\, songwriter\, guitarist and singer Sadie Dupuis scales the c
 areful line between what she calls being “outrageous and practical” in
  order to be heard at all.\n \n“You need to employ a self-preservational
  sense of humor to speak truth in an increasingly baffling world\,” says
  Dupuis. “I call it a ‘twerp verse’ when a musician guests on a trac
 k and says something totally outlandish – like a Lil Wayne verse – but
  it becomes the most crucial part. This record is our own twerp verse\, fo
 r those instances when you desperately need to stand up and show your teet
 h.”\n \nTwerp Verse was tracked in Brooklyn DIY space Silent Barn\, mixe
 d by Omaha legend Mike Mogis (Bright Eyes\, Rilo Kiley) and mastered by Gr
 ammy-nominated engineer Emily Lazar (Sia\, Haim\, Beck). The record pulls 
 from the most elastic pop moments in Squeeze’s Argybargy and the seesawi
 ng synth-rock of Deerhoof and the Rentals. With Dupuis on guitars\, vocals
 \, and synths\, supporting guitarist Andy Molholt (of psych pop outfit Las
 er Background) now joins Speedy veterans Darl Ferm on bass and Mike Falcon
 e on drums – and together they accelerate the band’s idiosyncrasy thro
 ugh the wilderness of Dupuis’ heady reflections on sex\, lies and audiot
 ape.\n \nDupuis\, who both earned an MFA in poetry and taught at UMass Amh
 erst\, propels the band’s brain-teasing melodies with her serpentine wit
 . Inspired by the cutting observations of Eve Babitz\, Aline Crumb’s bit
 ing memoirs\, and the acute humor of AstroPoet Dorothea Lasky\, Dupuis cra
 ftily navigates the danger zone that is building intimacy and political al
 lyship in 2018. Now as public pushback against the old guards reaches a fe
 ver pitch – in the White House\, Hollywood and beyond – the band fires
  shots in disillusioned Gen Y theme “Lucky 88\,” and casts a side-eye 
 towards suitors-turned-monsters in the cold-blooded single “Villain.” 
 Closing track “You Hate The Title” is a slinky traipse through the ban
 ality of this current moment in patriarchy – in which survivors are give
 n the mic\, but nitpicked over the timbre of their testimonies. “You hat
 e the title\, but you’re digging the song\,” Dupuis sings wryly\, “Y
 ou like it in theory\, but it’s rubbing you wrong.” Tuned smartly to t
 he political opacity of the present\, Twerp Verse rings clear as a bell.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nCIVIC\n \nOne of the most exhilar
 ating bands to emerge in recent years\, CIVIC have reimagined the reckless
  intensity of proto-punk for an era of endless uncertainty. On their 2021 
 debut album Future Forecast\, the Melbourne-based five-piece offered up a 
 barrage of songs matching their frenetic sound with both self-aware outpou
 ring and incisive observation of the world around them—a dynamic that’
 s earned massive critical acclaim as well as admiration from the likes of 
 punk legend Henry Rollins. As further shown on their upcoming sophomore fu
 ll-length Taken By Force—an album the band aptly sums up as “1984 meet
 s Endless Summer”—CIVIC joyfully obliterate the line between furious c
 atharsis and unbridled fun\, introducing a vital new energy into today’s
  musical landscape.  Hailed by Stereogum as “an unholy lo-fi pile-up of
  garage rock\, punk\, and ’90s-style noise-rock\,” CIVIC inject every 
 song with a visceral urgency hinting at their shared history in the local 
 hardcore scene. As frontman Jim McCullough recalls\, the band first took s
 hape back in 2017\, when he and a friend dreamed up a musical project insp
 ired by iconic Australian punk acts like Radio Birdman and The Saints. “
 We were in a bowling alley in Japan and came up with a very strong focus f
 or what the band could do\, which was take that three-chord ’70s punk so
 und but get a little more thoughtful with the melodies and songwriting\,
 ” says McCullough. Upon returning from Japan\, McCullough soon recruited
  a full lineup featuring Lewis Hodgson and bassist Roland Hlavka. Within s
 ix months\, CIVIC had banged out their debut EP New Vietnam—a powerhouse
  2018 release that prompted Vice to crown the band “Melbourne’s New Ki
 ngs of Wild Rock And Roll.”\n

 e Scranton\, Pennsylvania-based band Tigers Jaw\, is an ode to living in t
 he present. As this hectic era of distraction whirrs\, ticks\, swipes\, an
 d scrolls by each of us at an alarming speed\, the ability to maintain a s
 ense of priority for the human elements in our lives as well as a reflecti
 ve understanding of self\, remains a lost art. But here\, the group has se
 ized upon it. Tigers Jaw’s sixth album—and first for new label home Ho
 peless Records—finds members Ben Walsh (vocals/guitar)\, Brianna Collins
  (vocals/keyboards)\, Teddy Roberts (drums)\, and Colin Gorman (bass) at t
 he height of their powers\, fusing their collective skills with the synchr
 onicity and energy the band honed over several years of non-stop touring. 
 The result is a back-to-the-basement approach elevated by the unmistakable
  production of their longtime friend and collaborator Will Yip. The band
 ’s most sonically ambitious and lyrically affecting album to date\, I Wo
 n’t Care How You Remember Me sees a newfound freshness and creative free
 dom crystalizing the lush and dynamic world of Tigers Jaw.\n \n \n \nYOWL
 ER\n \nYowler is the Philadelphia-based solo project of Maryn Jones\, who 
 has been recording and releasing music online and in burned cd\, tape and 
 record form since as early as 2004. What started out in 2013 as a conceptu
 al project where dark thoughts and too-quiet moments could be placed\, Yow
 ler has become a main outlet for Jones’ songwriting. After most recently
  being a part of the loud pop outfit All Dogs as songwriter\, and long-tim
 e member and multi-instrumentalist in the psych-folk group Saintseneca\, J
 ones has been focusing her musical time and energy on writing for Yowler\,
  and collaborating with Philadelphia-based producer and engineer Kyle Gilb

 d-apocalyptic world it can feel like a waste of time to speak about time a
 t all. Why dwell on the past when we could just live in the present becaus
 e the future won’t shut up about how bad it’s going to be? But with T
 his Is The Kit\, the pseudonym of songwriter / banjo strummer / pinhole ca
 mera lover / Winchester UK born Paris dweller Kate Stables\, we’re going
  to have to give time just a modicum of consideration. Because not only is
  Kate still here and making albums of cataclysmic honesty and welcoming to
 nal embraces\, they are continuing to grow\, which is probably the only sm
 art way to move forward through time\, unless you’re one of those shrink
 ers.\n \n  This Is The Kit’s music places companionship at a premium\,
  so being welcomed into its space feels like an obvious privilege\, on rec
 ord and in concert hall with her stellar supporting cast of Rozi Plain (ba
 ss)\, Jamie Whitby-Coles (drums) and Neil Smith (guitar).  And at this cu
 rrent point in our confusing history\, continuing to be here at all\, to s
 tand tall and make music to gather to\, that’s a heroic act. Joyful surv
 ival as an act of time-wasting\,  I’ll take that any day of the week. L
 ook to This Is The Kit to spend at least one day of your week this year\, 
 I guarantee it will be time well wasted.  \n

 ke a kid: experimenting\, having fun\, and trying to discover new things a
 bout this work\,” says Pile’s Rick Maguire about All Fiction. It’s h
 is band’s eighth record\, and one that finds the ambitious group assembl
 ing its most texturally complex material yet—despite the fraught inspira
 tion underscoring its restive lyrics. Alongside the blistering drums and s
 corched-earth riffs that first galvanized Pile’s dedicated fanbase\, the
  band has incorporated elegiac strings\, mystifying vocal corrosions\, and
  haunting synths. From the creeping fear of cinematic opener “It Comes C
 loser” to the euphorically ascending keys on ego-shattering closer “Ne
 on Gray\,” All Fiction is an ornate\, carefully paced study on the subje
 ctivity of perception\, the data-shaping despotism of big tech\, and the c
 onnections between anxiety and death. In its most vital moments\, it’s a
 lso a resolute recommitment to the restorative significance of art and ima
 gination.\n \nFor fifteen years\, Pile’s evolving take on rock has earne
 d the group one oft-repeated superlative: “your favorite band’s favori
 te band.” Ceaseless touring took its members from Boston’s basement ci
 rcuit to international festivals\, hitting loftier technical apexes with e
 ach new record. Maguire—the fastidious composer\, evocative guitarist\, 
 and potent voice behind the solo-turned-punk project—gives musical body 
 to his interior world in scream-along-able lyrics that skew surreal. \n

 ng to record with a DIY approach – recording\, playing and mixing everyt
 hing himself.Starting from a basement home studio in 2018\, Far Caspian’
 s first two two EPs and album landed plays on BBC Radio 1 and 6 Music\, Ra
 dio X\, coverage from The Line of Best Fit\, Clash and Dork\, and numerous
  Spotify and YouTube playlists\; which all helped generate a dedicated and
  growing and engaged fanbase across the world. Live\, close friends join J
 oel to turn the project into a full band\, resulting in driven and upbeat 
 performances. This exciting sound was reflected in sold-out shows on the b
 and’s first record tours in London\, Leeds\, Manchester\, Paris\, Amster
 dam and Berlin. Following quickly from 2021’s ‘Ways To Get Out’-sop
 homore album ‘Like You Were Here’ isn’t a follow up record but more 
 so a departure into a different feel to his previous material.Joel’s inf
 luences for the new record lean heavily towards the late 90’s/2000’s a
 lternative scene with references to Autolux’s doubled guitars and expres
 sive drumming\, Sparklehorse mixed with The Radio Dept. vocal style and 
 ‘Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind’ styled electronic elements.Withi
 n this new sound brings expressive changes in mood. Songs like ‘Like You
  Were Here’ and ‘All The Same’ feel triumphant and filled with elati
 on as they push forward into crescendo. Whilst album closer ‘First Warni
 ng Shot’ refrains from breaking too far out of its delicacy. \n

 their music and stance defy stereotypic norms of rock musicians being open
