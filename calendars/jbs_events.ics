 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nWILLIAM ELLIOTT WHITMORE\n \n \nA
  man armed only with a banjo and a bass drum can be a formidable force\, e
 specially if his name is William Elliott Whitmore.  With his powerful vo
 ice and honest approach\, Whitmore comes from the land\, growing up on a 
 family farm in Lee County\, Iowa.  Still living on the same farm today\,
  Whitmore has truly taken the time to discover where his center lies\, and
  from that he will not be moved.\n \nWhitmore has repeatedly carved his ow
 n path\, honoring the longstanding tradition of folk music throughout his 
 nearly 20 year career\, while always allowing his blues\, soul and punk ro
 ck influences to shine through.  Getting his first break opening for his 
 friend’s hardcore band with just a banjo in hand\, he would discover ban
 ds like The Jesus Lizard\, Bad Brains\, Lungfish and Minutemen and soon le
 arn to play his own brand of rural\, roots music with that same DIY ethic.
 \n \nWilliam Elliott Whitmore has been back and forth across the United St
 ates and to cities around the world.  He’s toured with such diverse act
 s as Frank Turner\, Trampled By Turtles\, Clutch and Chris Cornell to name
  a few.  He’s appeared on some of the biggest stages around the world i
 ncluding Stagecoach Fest\, Byron Bluesfest (Australia) and End of the Road
  Fest (UK).  His willingness to take his show to any playing field has pr
 oved invaluable as he turned strangers to diehards with every performance.
 \n\n\n \nJORDAN TICEJordan Tice is a singer\, songwriter and guitarist who
  combines witty\, well-crafted songs with deft fingerstyle and flatpick gu
 itar playing. His performances have been compared to those of legends like
  Leo Kottke\, John Hartford\, and David Bromberg for their mix of virtuosi
 ty and playfulness and his songs have been compared to those of writers\, 
 Bob Dylan and John Prine for their humor\, introspection and philosophical
  nature. \n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nLONG BEARDMeans To Me is the sec
 ond full-length under Leslie Bear’s moniker\, Long Beard\, and her first
  since 2015’s Sleepwalker. Throughout the record\, Leslie explores what
  constitutes a home — how it extends beyond the physicality of a roof ov
 er your head to the comfort of another person. A sense of self\, stability
  or security.The last four years between records mark a particularly signi
 ficant and transitional time for Bear. A career move led her back to her h
 ometown in New Jersey long after her friends and peers moved away\, result
 ing in feelings of stasis and nostalgia that shape the album. Reflections 
 on the past are evident in tracks like album single “Sweetheart”\, in 
 which Bear considers a past love\, where they are now\, and her life in re
 lation to theirs.Bear’s sophomore album shows a growth and maturation in
  sound from her debut. Co-produced with Craig Hendrix (Japanese Breakfast)
 \, the record occupies a dreamlike space that weaves between shoegaze-ting
 ed guitars and upbeat\, jangly pop. While still loyal to Leslie’s signat
 ure ethereal\, melodic guitars and haunting whispered vocal delivery\, the
  fully realized arrangements demonstrate a stunning clarity throughout the
  album.\n \nThe perfect amalgamation between Bear’s ambient-textured loo
 ps met with the pristine production and pop stylings of Hendrix’s playin
 g can be heard in album standout “Snow Globe.” The combined reversal e
 ffects\, seamless transitions\, and heartbeat percussion are the language 
 of Means To Me.What Bear has created with Means To Me is not only a mirr
 or for herself\, but also a means for the listener to reflect on what home
  means to them. Whether Bear has defined a home for herself is left to won
 der\, as she leaves us with these final lines before the album crescendos 
 into an explosive distorted instrumental and slowly fades: “driving down
  through our state lines while you dream\, I’m thinking of a name to go 
 by.”\nYOWLERYowler is the Philadelphia-based solo project of Maryn Jones
 \, who has been recording and releasing music online and in burned cd\, ta
 pe and record form since as early as 2004. What started out in 2013 as a c
 onceptual project where dark thoughts and too-quiet moments could be place
 d\, Yowler has become a main outlet for Jones’ songwriting. After most r
 ecently being a part of the loud pop outfit All Dogs as songwriter\, and l
 ong-time member and multi-instrumentalist in the psych-folk group Saintsen
 eca\, Jones has been focusing her musical time and energy on writing for Y
 owler\, and collaborating with Philadelphia-based producer and engineer Ky
 le Gilbride to create the forthcoming Black Dog in My Path. Black Dog in 
 My Path is Yowler’s second album after 2014’s release The Offer\, and 
 was recorded in the many months after Jones’ move from Columbus\, Ohio t
 o Philadelphia. Created with Gilbride of Swearin’ and Missing Earth\, th
 e record is a kind of sonic quilt\, pieced together from various musical i
 nspirations and drawn from a period of great personal change. \n

  – Show\nCHARLY BLISS\n \n“I don’t know why it’s easiest for me to
  frame the darkest lyrics in the context of upbeat songs\,” says Charly 
 Bliss’ Eva Hendricks. “It’s completely instinctual and not something
  I ever plan out. It sort of mirrors how I am\, and maybe it’s a way of 
 protecting myself. In my opinion\, the two best emotional releases are cry
 ing and dancing\, so it makes sense to me to marry the two.” That combin
 ation is the core of Charly Bliss who\, on this record\, embraced both sid
 es of that equation more than ever before. Challenging each other to be ex
 posed\, to be seen for who they really are as people\, and then to double 
 down on the sound that emerged from that process is the story of the band
 ’s evolution from the scrappy upstarts who made 2017’s brash punk LP G
 uppy\, to the confident\, assured artists behind the comparatively dynamic
 \, unapologetically pop Young Enough.\n2ND GRADE\nRinging from hi-fi headp
 hones and blown-out boombox speakers alike comes the overloaded guitar gen
 ius of Easy Listening\, a record of rock ‘n’ roll daydreams and termin
 al boredom\, and 2nd Grade’s long awaited second LP on Double Double Wha
 mmy. Like a blue slushy on a hot day\, Easy Listening is a sweet respite
 . Like the Blue Angels touching down on the Las Vegas Strip\, Easy Listen

 8PM – Show\n \n \n \nOVERCOATS\n \nThe third full-length album from Ove
 rcoats\, Winner takes place in the kind of New York City spaces meant for 
 unencumbered dreaming: fire escapes and rooftops\, downtown late at night\
 , the majestic Manhattan skyline as glimpsed from the George Washington Br
 idge. But in paying homage to the city that formed them\, singer/songwrite
 rs Hana Elion and JJ Mitchell set their storytelling against a sonic backd
 rop more reminiscent of wide-open landscapes—an unbridled and euphoric s
 ound that evokes the wild rush of hitting the road with your closest confi
 dant\, with no particular destination in mind.\n \nProduced by two-time Gr
 ammy-winner Daniel Tashian (a co-producer on Kacey Musgraves’s widely ac
 claimed Golden Hour)\, Winner marks an evolution of the graceful musicalit
 y first displayed on Overcoats’ debut album YOUNG (a 2017 release that e
 arned praise from outlets like the New York Times and NPR Music\, who plac
 ed it at #4 on its best-of-the-year list). As a bold departure from YOUNG
 ’s sparse electronic pop and the atmospheric indie-rock of The Fight (a 
 2020 release that nabbed them a Breakthrough Artist nomination from the Am
 erican Association of Independent Music)\, the album encompasses a warm an
 d luminous sound sculpted from a tightly curated mix of elements: earthy g
 uitar tones\, elegantly rugged textures\, the duo’s signature heavenly h
 armonies.\nHALIMA\n \nRaised by her mother between Lagos and London\, and 
 now based in Brooklyn\, Halima draws from a tri-continental well. As an on
 ly child\, she learned to blend introspective periods spent alone with the
  collaborative day camps and community programs she at-tended for theatre 
 and music. As early as primary school\, she remembers developing processes
  for bringing musicians together\, continually from a place of creation. F
 rom early explorations of folk and piano to later studies of jazz and R&B\
 , Halima’s career has evolved\, making pit stops in pop-punk\, neo-soul\
 , and electronic along the way. Now\, her sound pulls unapologetically fro
 m a broad musical spectrum\, nodding sonically to those defining experienc
 es and pushing forward toward a more pointed exploration of self.\n \nAdmi
 red for her unique musicality and thoughtful approach to songwriting and p
 roducing\, Halima’s 2022 singles\, ‘Rent’ and ‘Talk’\, mark a ne
 w era artistically in both songwriting and production style.  Recent coll
 aborations with acclaimed artist/producers include Gianluca Buccellati\, 
  Beshken\, Hush Forte\, and Grammy-winner  Mikey Freedom Hart are to be r
 eleased throughout 2023. Her newest single\, ‘Vehicle’ is out March 3.

 8PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nFUCKED UP\n \nI was sent an unfi
 nished version of Dose Your Dreams so that I might contribute string par
 ts. I couldn’t stop listening to the rough mixes I received. A friend as
 ked me how the record was. I replied\, “My God\, Fucked Up have made the
 ir Screamadelica.”\n \nAnd psych-rock-groove it is. The drums mixed wid
 e\, propensity for drones\, for delay pedal\, for repetition\, groove. The
  politics and aesthetics of hardcore married to an “open format” appro
 ach to genre. Elements of doo-wop\, krautrock\, groove\, digital hardcore.
 \n \n“None of Your Business Man” opens the album in familiar enough te
 rritory\, a sax-assisted exit from an office space. But things get psyched
 elic very quickly. By the time the title track arrives\, Mike Haliechuk is
  whispering\, wah pedals are in full effect\, and we’re wearing oversize
 d t-shirts and pinwheeling. “Accelerate\,” the lyrical centerpiece of 
 the album\, storms in like Boredoms on a bullet train and dissolves into a
  digital nightmare. The album closer\, “Joy Stops Time\,” finds Fucked
  Up at their most Düsseldorfian\, nearly eight minutes of blissful motori
 k.\n \nAt the center of it all is Damian Abraham’s scream—a man chaine
 d\, a man tortured\, a true protagonist. The effect is one of an epic\, ev
 ery chapter attempting its own narrative devices\, its own genre hybridiza
 tion—and it works\, it works so insanely well. The drama unfolds like a 
 miniature world of many parts being explored\, a map being illuminated\, l
 ocation by location.\n \nAs with David Comes to Life\, there is a story h
 ere. David—who once came to life—is now indentured to a desk job. Davi
 d meets the elderly Joyce who closes his eyes\, opens his mind\, and sends
  him on a spiritual journey. David embarks on his own metaphysical odyssey
 . He sees a stage adaptation of his own life. He speaks to an angel in a l
 ightbulb. He sees an infinite series of universes as simulations within si
 mulations.\n \nMeanwhile\, Lloyd—Joyce’s lover—was sent\, decades ag
 o\, by Joyce on the same odyssey\, but was lost in the void. Lloyd seeks t
 o be found and reunited with his lover. Where will David end up? Will Joyc
 e and Lloyd be reunited?\n \nDose Your Dreams—meaning: treat your dreams
  as you would a dream\, allow yourself to be lost within them\, allow them
  to open your heart and your mind\, enjoy them as you would a drug. Reach 
 out for my hand and pull me close.\n \n—Owen Pallett\n \nJune 2018\nREST

 nFever Museum is the first LP from the Cleveland and Philadelphia band Orb

 axwell Stern’s (Signals Midwest\, Timeshares\, Meridian) past output wil
 l find themselves in familiar territory\, yet Fever Museum’s densely lay
 ered vocals\, downtuned guitars\, synthesizers\, and odd timings position 
 the record as a unique vessel for exploring ideas well outside the realm o
 f their past output. Drummers Adam Beck (Into It. Over It.\, Sincere Engin

  recordings\, sharing space with Reif’s programming. Bassist Chris Bagli
 vo (Superweaks) and drummer Jarret Nathan (Pears) round out Orbits’ live
  lineup. \n \nThe remote aspect of writing and recording for Orbits was a
  natural fit for Reif and Stern. The two first met on a music forum in 200
 6\, sharing tracks from their high school bands via mediafire links and sn
 ail-mailing burned CDs. Their music careers began in parallel\, with Reif 
 booking shows from his dorm room in Bellingham\, Washington\, and Stern to
 uring from his native Cleveland. After meeting in-person for the first tim
 e in 2011\, the two began traveling the world with their respective projec
 ts\, often crossing paths and occasionally pinch-hitting in each other’s
  bands. It wasn’t until 2020\, with Stern living in Philadelphia and Rei
 f coincidentally finding himself in Cleveland\, that the two began writing
  together. They released their first music as Orbits\, the Rising Tide in

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nTANUKICHAN\n \nTanukichan is the 
 solo project of classically-trained Bay Area native Hannah van Loon\, whos
 e music screeched to a halt when she discovered what she affectionately ca
 lls “dad rock” in her tween years. Throughout her self described “sh
 eltered” adolescence\, van Loon taught herself guitar by spending hours 
 in front of the radio\, replicating riffs and chords from omnipresent band
 s like The Beatles and Incubus. Although van Loon is the creator and leade
 r of Tanukichan\, the project can be considered a collaboration between he
 r and the Grammy-nominated chillwave pioneer Chaz Bear of Toro y Moi. Afte
 r seeing an early Tanukichan show in 2016\, Bear expressed an interest in 
 working with van Loon\; Radio love\,Tanukichan’s first headbanger of an 
 EP\, arrived on Bear’s own Company Records that same year.The promising 
 four-song project was followed in 2018 by van Loon’s breakout debut LP\,
  Sundays\, which prompted her first solo headlining tour and dates opening
  for artists like Kero Kero Bonito and The Drums. Sundays earned Tanukicha
 n enthusiastic critical acclaim\, with Pitchfork writing that it “captur
 es the spirit of a day whose wide-open nature fosters anxieties as well as
  ambitions” and Rolling Stone lauding its “bruising riffs\, taut groov
 es\, and open-road-ready guitar anthems.” Tanukichan’s sophomore album
  GIZMO is out on March 3rd\, 2023. While still rooted in the eerie shoegaz
 e she’s become known and loved for\, it also sees her go beyond her comf
 ort zone\, incorporating elements of grunge\, industrial synths\, nu metal
  basslines\, and electric guitars that culminate into a captivating wall-o
 f-sound. The result is her most fun-sounding work yet.\nWINTERWhat Kind of
  Blue Are You?\, Winter’s sophomore release with Bar/None Records\, is a
 n emotional excavation of Samira Winter’s purest self.\nMusically\, the 
 LP’s 10 songs reconnect with the earliest incarnation of Winter\, once a
 gain painting with brushstrokes of distorted guitar\, but using them to fu
 el a wiser\, more mature form of sonic liberation. Whereas 2020’s Endle
 ss Space (Between You and I) was steeped in fairytale surrealism and spri
 nglike grace\, her latest offering is crystalline and spartan\, songs stri
 pped to their inner blue core\, Winter’s smoldering shadow self.\nIt’s
  another stunning work in a canon that’s established her as one of Los A
 ngeles’ most enduring\, consistently-head-turning dream poppers\, the me
 lancholy and bittersweet beauty that’s been with her throughout Winter
 ’s existence now pushed to center stage. Strengthened by her ever-increa
 sing powers as a songwriter\, she confronts painful wounds of trauma and d
 espair for the first time on record\, and achieves some semblance of peace
  and healing in the process.\n

  band have shared an entertaining video for first single and album opener 
 “Monotony” featuring celebrated American comedian\, actress and TV hos
 t Nikki Glaser playing a somewhat unconventional psychiatrist. Commentin
 g on the song and video frontman Matt Pond says: “Over the last few y
 ears\, I’ve tried to focus on my breathing—to try to and be a better s
 inger\, to try and be a better person. But it’s hard to sit still and sl
 ow down when the world seems so unruly. Monotony is an anthem about the da
 ily tightrope—searching for the right path between passion and apathy. 
 All the while\, I’ve been working with Nikki Glaser. Her fearlessness is
  contagious. Since she never hesitates to tell me what she really thinks\,
  I thought it made perfect sense for Nikki to portray my therapist in the 
 video.” \n \nSometimes\, a change of view can transform a person’s wo
 rld. On ‘Don’t Come Down’\, the artist formerly known as Matt Pond P
 A can be found with his “shoulder on the concrete” of a pavement\, sco
 ping out the world anew. This granular realignment of perspective serves a
 s an open door to the debut album from The Natural Lines. At once clearly 
 Pond’s work yet a huge leap forward in its measured songcraft\, melodic 
 immediacy\, collaborative detail and wryly questioning lyrics\, the result
  is a gorgeous album of intimate reflections from a relocated\, renamed\, 
 revivified talent.\n

 be a silver lining all around.” So begins One Day\, the captivating new 
 album from critically acclaimed Minneapolis duo The Cactus Blossoms. Writt
 en and recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic\, the record explores the ten
 sion between optimism and despair that’s defined much of the past few ye
 ars of American life\, examining the power (or naïveté\, depending on yo
 ur perspective) of positive thinking in the face of chaos and uncertainty.
  The songs here are tender and timeless\, with straightforward arrangement
 s centered around brothers Jack Torrey and Page Burkum’s airtight harmon
 ies\, and the performances are warm and intimate to match\, delivered with
  a soulful\, ’70s-inspired palette of playful Wurlitzer\, breezy guitars
 \, and muscular percussion.\n \nThe Cactus Blossoms broke out nationally i
 n 2016 with their JD McPherson-produced debut\, You’re Dreaming. Dates w
 ith Kacey Musgraves\, Jenny Lewis\, and Lucius followed\, as did raves fro
 m the New York Times and NPR\, who praised “the brothers’ extraordinar
 y singing.” The band was further catapulted into the spotlight in 2018\,
  when David Lynch tapped them to perform in the return of Twin Peaks\, and
  continued to build on their success with their 2019 sophomore LP\, Easy W
 ay\, which led Rolling Stone to laud the duo’s “rock-solid\, freak of 
 genetics harmonies.”\nTWO RUNNERTwo Runner is Paige Anderson and Emilie
  Rose. The American Roots duo from Northern California embody the hills th

  influential fixture of independent music ever since. The group released t
 heir debut LP In Heaven (2011) via Domino\, and in 2012 their song Meet th
 e Frownies was sampled by Kendrick Lamar and Dr Dre on The Recipe. Having 
 left Domino and changed their name to Mr Twin Sister\, the group re-emerge
 d in 2014 with the low lit disco and funk of their self-titled Mr Twin Sis
 ter. The record appeared on best-of-year lists from Pitchfork\, Gorilla vs
  Bear\, TIME\, and many others.  In 2018 the group released Echo Arms\, t
 heir most popular track to date\, and Salt\, their third and most diverse 
 album yet. 2021 saw the release of the group’s fourth full length LP Al 
 Mundo Azul\, a vibrant\, surreal record that swaps the group’s restraine

  freelance audio engineer\, ther has often served as a capsule of unnervin

 “trying to capture the feeling of a thousand ongoing apocalypses swarmin
 g in a pivotal moment.” Heather summarizes this record as midway between
  the world-weariness they’ve always felt\, and the helplessness of watch
 ing the world be dismantled from a screen: “I’m feeling a little frust
 rated with the timeline being during the pandemic\, because i feel like i 
 would’ve written a record about the same things. We’re reaching a brea
 king point: from an ecological perspective\, from a socioeconomic perspect
 ive: we’re already in crisis. The pandemic has made it feel different be
 cause we’ve been forced to sit and do nothing\, and watch… that’s an
  apocalypse. It’s not when robot dogs shoot us in the street: we’re al
 ready there. It’s that weird intersection of doing nothing and feeling e
 xhausted about how little we can do.” If we’re already at an end\, tre
 mbling marks a new beginning: one where the planet and people interact wit
 h failing systems\, recognize sinister natures hiding in plain sight\, and
  one where we understand how to stare down evil forces with realism and te

 7PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nCOME\n \nCome is a cult American
  alternative rock band\, formed in Boston by Thalia Zedek (vocals\, guitar
 )\, Chris Brokaw (guitar\, vocals)\, Arthur Johnson (drums)\, and Sean O
 ’Brien (bass).Brokaw and Zedek had been introduced by a mutual friend in
  Boston shortly before Zedek moved to New York to join legendary noise roc
 kers Live Skull in ’86. They stayed in touch\, and Brokaw briefly played
  in Zedek’s side project Via before forming the influential slowcore gro
 up Codeine.\n \nZedek and Johnson first met in the fall of 1988 while on t
 our with their respective bands Live Skull and Bar-B-Q Killers. O’Brien 
 and Johnson were long-time friends and former housemates from the close-kn
 it Athens\, GA\, music scene of the ’80s\, where Sean played guitar and 
 then bass in the Kilkenny Cats\, and each of their bands was featured in t
 he 1987 documentary Athens\, GA–Inside/Out.\n \n1990 found all four musi
 cians living in Boston\, and they decided to join forces to see what might
  happen. The musical chemistry was immediate\, and it wasn’t long before
  the band had its first show and a recording offer from Sub Pop.\n \nCome
 ’s first release was “Car” b/w “Last Mistake\,” the August 1991 
 installment in the first volume of Sub Pop’s Singles Club. The single ma
 de them one of the most highly touted new acts on the underground scene\, 
 and there was more than one label eager to release the band’s first full
 -length effort. Come chose Matador in the US and Placebo in the UK to put 
 out their debut album Eleven Eleven in 1992. The album was a great success
  with both critics and fellow musicians\, and tours followed with Nirvana\
 , Dinosaur Jr.\, Sugar\, and Pavement\, among others. Pitchfork has called
  it “one of the most elusive gems of the Matador catalog”. After the r
 elease\, Brokaw left Codeine\, devoting himself full-time to Come.\n \nCom
 e released their second album\, Don’t Ask Don’t Tell\, in 1994\, again
  on Matador and Placebo. It was to be the last album recorded with the rhy
 thm section of Johnson and O’Brien. Though somewhat calmer than its pred
 ecessor\, it was equally as grave. Among the highlights of the album\, and
  of the whole of the band’s impressive song catalogue\, are the two dark
  ballads\, “Let’s Get Lost” and “Arrive\,” each closing a side o
 f the vinyl edition. Brokaw and Zedek’s emotional dual guitar work rival
 s Verlaine/Lloyd\, chiming and majestic\, cascading into feedback-ridden s
 qualls informed by both punk and metal\, sifted through one of the tightes
 t rhythm sections ever assembled.\n \nCome’s third record\, 1996’s Nea
 r Life Experience\, was recorded with two different rhythm sections: Tara 
 Jane O’Neil and Kevin Coultas from the now-legendary Louisville band Rod
 an\, and Chicago’s Mac McNeilly (The Jesus Lizard) and Bundy Brown (Tort
 oise). It was released on Matador in the United States and on Domino in Eu
 rope.The band’s final release\, 1998’s double album Gently\, Down the 
 Stream\, was again released on Matador/Domino and featured a new rhythm se
 ction of Daniel Coughlin on drums and Winston Braman on bass. After extens
 ive touring on the release in both Europe and the States\, the band went o
 n hiatus\, and both Brokaw and Zedek pursued solo careers and other musica
 l collaborations.\n \n \n \nSUN ORGAN\n \nPhiladelphia\, PA\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nWESTERMAN\n \nUK artist Westerman
  returns with his first offering in two years with the song “Idol\; RE-r
 un” out via Partisan Records. The new track\,produced by James Krivcheni
 a and Westerman\,juxtaposes gentle and celestial sonics with an aggrieved 
 disposition and features artwork by renownedNew York via Portugal Graphic 
 Designer and Illustrator Bráulio Amado. The song was written after Wester
 man emergedfrom a period of disenchantment with making music\, and with th
 e future of his career feeling abstract\, it seemed unclear to Westerman w
 hether the material he was recording would ever be heard. Creatively\, thi
 s offered a strange kind of freedom\, and accommodated some of the most ad
 venturous and unselfconscious songwriting of his career. Finding textures 
 became a central concern taking programming and looping into his own hands
  in a way he never had before\, creating polyrhythmic grooves to lend urge
 ncy to his inner dialogue.”Idol\; RE-run” is the first taste of songs 
 written in this period and provides a hint for what’s to come from Weste
 rman in the coming year. The track featuresJames Krivchenia\, Mikel Patric
 k Avery and Booker Stardrum on drums\, Ben Reed on bass\, Luke Temple on s
 ynth\, Mat Davidson on piano\, Robin Eubanks on the trombone and of course
  Westerman on vocals\, guitar and synth.Speaking about the new song\, West
 erman shares:”The lyrics to the song were written around the same time a
 s the storming of the Capitol. The compulsion towards the pedestal is stro
 ng. The need to scapegoat and revere without logic. Our populists actively
  celebrate their being people who don’t know anything other or better th
 an anyone else\, yet these spectres with their failings conduct our anger 
 and resentment as if they were gods. They are nothing more than the shadow
  of something else\, the face fronting a need to be loved or revered prese
 nt in everyone. And there will always be another face to front.”\nTWAIN\
 n \nHave you ever…\n \n…faced an impossible question\, to be answered 
 at once by a kaleidoscope of wind\, diffusing your bewilderment into thous
 ands of spinning bulbs?\n \n…awoken to hear the person sleeping beside y
 ou speaking a language they do not speak in their waking life? …felt y
 our legs possessed\, to throw you across the room in shapes? …lost you
 r heart\, only to find it on the bank of a cold spring\, in the hands of a
  filling station attendant\, or in the dust swimming through the light of 
 your bedroom window?\n \n Have you ever listened to Twain?\n \n“A lone
 ly day\, I went outside to smoke awhile\,and think about a picture in a bo
 ok:He was laying in the grass in his suit\,as the angler posed in pursuit 
 of the fish”\n \n For the past decade or so\, Mt. Davidson has cultiva
 ted his songs and sounds\, attempting to create a bridge\, a meeting place
 \, between the terrestrial and the mystic.  He is a ponderous and delicat

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nNARROW HEAD\n \nTruly great pop s
 ongs do not require a cheery outlook in order to work\, nor do they pander
  to expectations of syrupy sweet easy-listening. Rather\, the best pop mus
 ic is a matter of refinement and pure intention\, of dialing groove to mel
 ody so that the two might puncture the malaise of everyday living in uniso
 n\, revealing some brief\, sober truth about our shared human condition. O
 n their third LP\, Moments of Clarity (Run for Cover)\, Narrow Head have a
 chieved precisely this feat. Traversing the depths of massive\, churning r
 iffs\, often distorted to the point of violence\, bouncing\, lock-grooved 
 rhythms\, and crystalline\, gorgeously constructed hooks\, the Houston-bas
 ed outfit puts on a masterclass in the art of writing songs that match the
  pain\, pleasure\, and confusion of modern living. Each track is sentiment
 al without being precious\, heavy without unnecessary griminess\, pop-forw
 ard without letting the listener off the hook easy: these songs ask for so
 me form of hurt or desire to be paid back to them in return\, some promise
  that the listener is putting equal skin into the game.\n \n \n \nGRAHAM 
 HUNT\n \nWisconsin Musician Graham Hunt’s latest effort\, “If You Knew

  for combining wistful melodies with lyrics that make stagnant moments fee
 l improbably vivid compliments an increasingly refined incorporation of 
 ’90s and early ’00s alt-rock touchstones. Through all of the familiari
 ty\, Hunt has managed to develop a style that feels authentically singular
 \, an honest extension of his tastes\, preferences\, and experiences.\n \n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nJANA HORN\n \nOptimism seemed to 
 come about indirectly\, almost in passing\, a feeling of being in-between 
 things. I was really mobile at that time\, living wherever. Half the songs
  came through in a week. “Jordan” perhaps the most out of the blue… 
 sitting there as I was on my brother’s couch in Austin. But I guess I do
 n’t think that anything comes from nowhere. Everything is writing to me.

 ou’re looking out a window.\nI had just discovered\, late\, Raymond Carv
 er Broadcast\, Sibylle Baier (which “Tonight” is more or less dedicate

 “Car Crash While Hitchhiking” by Denis Johnson. I had “Heart Needs a
  Home” in mind\, “The Great Valerio\;” I was just really moving thro
 ugh the world\, hanging in the shadows of the people I wanted to be. Hopin
 g\, looking out\, this is Optimism. I was looking for anything.\nIn 2018\,
  I took these ten songs into a studio in Austin with some members of the b
 and Knife in the Water. I’d been singing with them at the time and it fe
 lt right. My friend Ian\, who I’d been performing with as a duo for a fe
 w years\, was with me on drums. “Friends Again” and “Jordan” were 
 written in the process. “Jordan” was such an outlier\, I thought: I ca
 n’t put this on the album. Then at some point in the recording process\,
  decided to embrace it—the question of whether spiritual themes should b
 e a part of my work—which wouldn’t even be a question now. It’s in e
 verything. But at the time\, you know\, it was the first time\, and so the

 ’s music is based on evoking mood\; their vivid arrangements utilize tim
 e and space to build soundscapes that invite the listener into their world

 side of jazz\, and the samples that form the foundation of hip hop. They p
 ush the boundaries of instrumental soul and funk with their own approach h
 oned by countless hours in the studio\, studying the masters\, and perhaps
  most importantly\, the ‘tyranny of distance’ that dictates a unique p
 erspective to their music. Hailing from just outside of Melbourne\, Austra
 lia\, their first two albums\, All News Is Good News and Daylight Savings 
 amassed a die-hard fanbase and brought their sound from their home studio 
 to every corner of the globe. The band is now signed to Big Crown Records\
 , joining a lineage of contemporary and classic sounds that have influence
 d Surprise Chef’s music since their formation in2017. Surprise Chef is L
 achlan Stuckey on guitar\, Jethro Curtin on keys\, Carl Lindeberg on bass\
 , AndrewCongues on drums\, and Hudson Whitlock—the latest member who doe
 s it all from percussion to composing to producing. Their self proclaimed 
 “moody shades of instrumental jazz-funk” have a bit of everything: pun
 chy drums\, infectious keys\, rhythm guitar you might hear on a Studio One
  record\, and flute lines that could be from a Blue Note session. But when

 8PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nSTUCK\n \nWorking at a mixing bo
 ard one night\, a catchphrase popped into Greg Obis’ head: “freak freq
 uency.” He was ringing out feedback during his job as a sound engineer\,
  and started to picture the parallels between acoustic physics and politic
 al trends. “If you think about a waveform\, as the frequency rises\, the
  space between the sine waves gets less and less\,” Obis explains. “Wi
 th that downward trend comes constant heightening\, stress and tension.”
  He came to see freak frequency as an apt metaphor for the decline of West
 ern empire\, an inverse relationship between the (positive) deterioration 
 of American hegemony and the (negative) worsening of daily life under that
  fall. It was a fitting title for the new material Obis was planning for S
 tuck\, the frenetic and twisted post-punk outfit he formed in 2018. Inspir
 ed by the doomy social economics of Mark Fisher’s Capitalist Realism\, t
 he bleak worldbuilding of horror games Demon’s Souls and Bloodborne\, an
 d the bombastic yet arty satire of Devo\, Obis channeled his audio analogy
  into Freak Frequency\, an album ringing out with explosive sounds and ide
 as. Though its songs tackle the violence of wealth\, the nightmares of tec
 hnocracy\, and the rise of the conspiratorial layman\, Freak Frequency is 
 Stuck’s quirkiest record to date—compositionally challenging and equip
 ped with menace\, yet dotted with vibrant fun. “Being in a brooding post
 -punk band isn’t that appealing to me\,” jokes Obis. “When things ar
 e bad\, all you can really do is laugh.”\n \n \n \nMESH\n \nPhiladelphi

 ck here for tickets to the June 18th show!\n \n\nPROTOMARTYR\n \nThere is 
 darkness in the poetry of Ultimate Success Today\, Protomartyr’s fifth a
 lbum. The theme of things ending\, above all human existence\, is present 
 and reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy’s ‘The Road’. ‘Day Without End
 ’\, the first song\, sets the tone for the whole album. “This is the d
 awning of the day without end / when fear steps into light”. The music h
 ere sounds delicate\, airy and at the same time carried by an insistent\, 
 light\, metallic drum part by Alex Leonard and a punctuating bass line by 
 Scott Davidson. There are exquisite\, subtle gifts from other instruments 
 that always heighten the guitar\, instead of fighting with it. They help t
 o create a harmonious wall of sound all of its own. This was intentional. 
 Greg Ahee wanted to use different textures other than pedals\, and the dro
 ne quality of some of those instruments colours the guitar and the whole s
 ound with a warm\, rich in reverb\, yet all-consuming landscape for Joe Ca
 sey’s voice. The album was recorded in a late 19th century church Dreaml
 and Recording Studios in upstate New York\, which still has its original h
 igh arched ceilings\, creating a natural and eerie reverb. Protomartyr co-
 produced these songs with David Tolomei\, who thought they would capture t
 he essence of the place. The quality of sound enhances the idea of disappe
 arance\, of dissolving away through the high ceiling. Sometimes it brings 
 us back to life and “Everybody’s hunted with a smile / being processed
  by the boys”. And it sounds like “a riot in the streets”.\n

 ARTYR\n \nThere is darkness in the poetry of Ultimate Success Today\, Prot
 omartyr’s fifth album. The theme of things ending\, above all human exis
 tence\, is present and reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy’s ‘The Road’. 
 ‘Day Without End’\, the first song\, sets the tone for the whole album
 . “This is the dawning of the day without end / when fear steps into lig
 ht”. The music here sounds delicate\, airy and at the same time carried 
 by an insistent\, light\, metallic drum part by Alex Leonard and a punctua
 ting bass line by Scott Davidson. There are exquisite\, subtle gifts from 
 other instruments that always heighten the guitar\, instead of fighting wi
 th it. They help to create a harmonious wall of sound all of its own. This
  was intentional. Greg Ahee wanted to use different textures other than pe
 dals\, and the drone quality of some of those instruments colours the guit
 ar and the whole sound with a warm\, rich in reverb\, yet all-consuming la
 ndscape for Joe Casey’s voice. The album was recorded in a late 19th cen
 tury church Dreamland Recording Studios in upstate New York\, which still 
 has its original high arched ceilings\, creating a natural and eerie rever
 b. Protomartyr co-produced these songs with David Tolomei\, who thought th
 ey would capture the essence of the place. The quality of sound enhances t
 he idea of disappearance\, of dissolving away through the high ceiling. So
 metimes it brings us back to life and “Everybody’s hunted with a smile
  / being processed by the boys”. And it sounds like “a riot in the str
 eets”.\n

 7PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nBAYONNE\n \nSince his 2016 debut
  album Primitives\, Bayonne has channeled his vast imagination into an ele
 gant yet wildly experimental form of electronic pop\, equal parts meditati
 ve and mesmerizing. In the making of his latest body of work\, the Austin-
 based artist/producer/multi-instrumentalist otherwise known as Roger Selle
 rs found himself in even greater need of an outlet for his kinetic creativ
 e impulses\, thanks to an intense convergence of events in his personal li
 fe: his father’s diagnosis with and eventual death from cancer\, the end
  of a significant relationship\, and an overwhelming struggle with depress
 ion and anxiety. Deeply informed by a deliberate transformation of his mus
 ical process\, Bayonne’s third full-length Temporary Time ultimately mak
 es for his most expansive work to date—an album of both painfully raw in
 trospection and otherworldly beauty.\n

 8PM – Show\nLUNACY (10:45 PM)\n \nLUNACY is a dystopian shadow figure lo
 cated in Rural Pennsylvania— a character set in the empty corroded futur
 e focusing on themes of loneliness\, emptiness & mental illness. A charact
 er that often fits the description of late ‘80s & early ‘90s post-apoc
 alyptic films.\n \nEcho In The Memory marks a new chapter for LUNACY’s s
 onic annihilation centered around trying to rebuild a world that no longer
  exists. Previous works have been recorded on a 4- track Tascam Portastudi
 o using various analog single unit drum machines\, guitar\, bass and synth
 s. On this upcoming release the recording process has changed quite a bit.
  Echo In the Memory was recorded on an Otari Broadcast MX50/50 – a 4 tra
 ck ¼ inch tape machine brought back to life by Sean Hur. All backing trac
 ks\, drum samples & loops were produced on an all black MPC1000 except\, 
 “Fragmented Pulse” which used the classic DR-55 with an 8/12 bitcrushe
 r fuzz pedal handmade by Kyle Reiff. Both analog & digital synths were use
 d along with guitar & bass with various effects pedals. Recorded over a tw
 o year period from 2019 – 2021 in the Dustbin in Rural Pennsylvania\, mi
 xed by Connor Clasen & Mastered by Oliver Ackermann.\nHOUSE OF HARM (9:45

 two 2019 demo EPs quickly earned them a dedicated international following\

 ltro’s sophomore album crystallizes those dreams and experiences into a 
 post-rock manifesto of dazzling beauty. Its songs combine touches of shoeg
 aze\, ambient and neo-psychedelia with the soulful transcendence of South 
 American folk–the purity of stringed instruments\, supple syncopated per
 cussion and elusive melodies that define the works of Latin American legen
 ds such as Violeta Parra\, Víctor Jara and Atahualpa Yupanqui. From the p
 ropulsive\, chant-like groove of “Guanaco” to the art-pop panache of 
 “All the Time in the World\, ”Underbelly is the kind of record that in
 vites you to quiet down and listen\, savoring every single detail.The albu
 m reaches an emotional pinnacle during its second half\, when the majestic
  lament of “Softy”– seeped in exquisite cushions of reverb–segues 
 into the hypnotic reverie of “Kerosene.” It also signals a new chapter
  in the fusion of Latin roots with mainstream rock\, anchoring its sonic q
 ueston a rare commodity: inspired songwriting.\n

  what the kids called singer/songwriter Adam Klopp in his early teens when
  he fronted punk cover bands in Cleveland\, Ohio.  An intended insult\, t
 he label seemed fair and fitting in a way\, given Klopp’s religious upbr
 inging and angelic voice. After high school\, Adam left Ohio for college i
 n Utah. While his career as a student would prove short-lived\, he integra
 ted into Provo and SLC’s underground music and art scene\, left religion
  behind\, and called his new band “Choir Boy”.“It seemed funny to me
  as sort of a comical reclamation of the mocking title I received from “
 punk” peers as a teen. While serving as a weird reflection of my childho
 od and musical heritage.”\n \nSince Choir Boy’s gorgeous debut LP on T
 eam Love records in 2016\, the dream-pop outfit has gained a cult followin
 g online and in underground circles.  Adam’s stunning vocal range\, lay
 ered compositions\, and heartbreaking melodies are backed by musical partn

 – and along with a rotating cast of players\, create the perfect blend o

 bums of expertly crafted pop punk\, Remember Sports follows up last year
 ’s epic Like a Stone with the first EP of their decade-long run. Recorde
 d piece meal in their respective homes\, sometimes together\, sometimes ap
 art\, Leap Day trades the live immediacy of their studio classics for some
 thing cozier\, though no less rousing. The core trio of Carmen Perry\, Cat
 herine Dwyer\, and Jack Washburn have always kept up active home recording
  practices for their solo projects–Carmen as Addie Pray\, Catherine as S
 pring Onion\, Jack under his own name–and here we find them gently foldi
 ng sounds sprung from their bedrooms into their signature brand of basemen
 t rock. Absent a dedicated drummer for the first time in their recorded hi
 story\, the band opts for simple drum machine accompaniment\, lending the 
 music a fresh weightlessness even as Carmen’s arresting vocals and sharp
  lyrics bring gravity in all their righteous anger\, scathing self-reproac
 h\, and disarming tenderness. Musically\, all the thrilling guitar riffs a
 nd grooving bass lines we’ve come to expect are here\, but the gradual r
 ecording process offered the band more opportunity to explore and experime
 nt\, adding on subtle layers of instrumentation\, distortion\, and electro
 nics\, and with them a warm sense of depth. In all\, Leap Dayis a short an
 d sweet\, loose but confident affair\; at once a reminder of Remember Spor
 ts’ absolute mastery of the pop rock anthem and a tantalizing sip from t
 he well of ideas they have yet to plumb.\n

 bout this work\,” says Pile’s Rick Maguire about All Fiction. It’s h
 is band’s eighth record\, and one that finds the ambitious group assembl
 ing its most texturally complex material yet—despite the fraught inspira
 tion underscoring its restive lyrics. Alongside the blistering drums and s
 corched-earth riffs that first galvanized Pile’s dedicated fanbase\, the
  band has incorporated elegiac strings\, mystifying vocal corrosions\, and
  haunting synths. From the creeping fear of cinematic opener “It Comes C
 loser” to the euphorically ascending keys on ego-shattering closer “Ne
 on Gray\,” All Fiction is an ornate\, carefully paced study on the subje
 ctivity of perception\, the data-shaping despotism of big tech\, and the c
 onnections between anxiety and death. In its most vital moments\, it’s a
 lso a resolute recommitment to the restorative significance of art and ima
 gination.\n \nFor fifteen years\, Pile’s evolving take on rock has earne
 d the group one oft-repeated superlative: “your favorite band’s favori
 te band.” Ceaseless touring took its members from Boston’s basement ci
 rcuit to international festivals\, hitting loftier technical apexes with e
 ach new record. Maguire—the fastidious composer\, evocative guitarist\, 
 and potent voice behind the solo-turned-punk project—gives musical body 
 to his interior world in scream-along-able lyrics that skew surreal. \n
