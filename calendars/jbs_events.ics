 o change”.Teenage Halloween deal in strident\, ripping power pop out of 
 New Jersey. Newest album\, Till You Return\, serves up 13 songs that reach
  out a hand to those in need\, whilst looking deep within to uncover perso
 nal failings and private yearnings. Gender identity\, state abuses\, findi
 ng solace in mental illness\, and radical self awareness all vie for space
  among searing arrangements typified by heartfelt vocals and irrepressible
  energy.The band\, which operated as a ‘rotating cast’ in its early ye
 ars\, is now firmly entrenched as an essential four-piece comprised of Luk
  Henderiks (vocals\, guitar) alongside Eli Frank (lead guitar\, vocals)\, 
 Tricia Marshall (bass\, vocals) and Peter Gargano (drums). The quartet mai
 ntain the vital energy of their previous incarnations\, but bring an even 
 more focused punch. The result leaves greater room for Henderiks’s lyric
 s and renews the band’s sonic mission to uplift themselves and those aro
 und them\nTINY STILLS\nFFO Bayside\, Fountains of Wayne\, The Weakerthans\

 round level of an apartment building in Manhattan’s Chinatown\, multiple
  lithium batteries combusted in an e-bike shop. It was just after midnight
  when songwriter Allegra Krieger awoke to a banging on her door. She made 
 it out\, fleeing down eight flights of stairs and a “wall of grey smoke\
 ,” which she recalls in her song\, “One or the Other.” Throughout th
 e song\, Krieger cradles gratitude and conjures a universe in which she re
 sponded differently to the fire. Ultimately\, she leaves us with two quest
 ions: “What do we know about living? What do we know about dying?”It w
 as in the months following the fire that Krieger wrote much of Art of the 
 Unseen Infinity Machine\, her second full-length album with Double Double 
 Whammy\, a collection of 12 songs that pick at the fragile membrane betwee
 n life and death. Krieger’s previous album\, I Keep My Feet on the Frag
 ile Plane\, hewed more closely to the domestic spaces of city and mind. Ro
 lling Stone regarded the album as “ten songs of heady philosophical mean
 derings packed with emotional dynamite\,” and likened her “finely phra
 sed lyrics” to those of “Joni Mitchell\, Leonard Cohen\, [and] David B
 erman.” Krieger’s existential meditations remain on Art of the Unseen 
 Infinity Machine\, however her meandering melodies have taken on a stronge
 r sense of direction. She narrates candidly and assertively\; the full-ban
 d arrangements never overpower\, only offer a robust platform on which Kri
 eger’s voice reaches new heights.\nAMELIA CRY TIL I DIE\nWest Philly que

 Balancing uncompromising underground instincts with the impulse and pleasu

 aim across all kinds of scenes globally. From searing techno to Baltimore 
 club\, downright sleazy ghetto house to razor-sharp electro\, his club cre
 dentials have always been wide-reaching and on-point\, but his star has tr
 uly risen for the way he folds broader pop and rap hooks into these sounds
 . While he’s still busy slaying dancefloors\, his increased focus on voc
 als on his Dedicated 2 Disrespect EP for XL Recordings has made LSDXOXO ev
 ery inch the card-carrying superstar.This duality in the LSDXOXO sound has
  led to high-profile co-signs\, including remixing Lady Gaga\, Pink Panthe
 ress and Shygirl and producing five tracks for Kelela’s album Raven (War
 p)\, not to mention collaborating with VTSS\, Eartheater and Tygapaw. Exte
 nding his rise as a songwriter\, his fully-fledged live show has now taken
  to the stage\, giving the fierce identity of his music huge audiences at 
 festivals including Primavera\, Nuits Sonores and Rewire.Of course\, his d
 ual life as a DJ still finds him constantly tearing up the rulebook with h
 is genre-fluid style\, whether at the helm of his pleasure-loving Floorgas
 m parties in Berlin and London or manning his May 2023 residency on BBC Ra
 dio 1 in the UK.The press are catching on to his relentless ascendance thr
 ough features in BUTT (shot by fabled photographer Wolfgang Tillmans) and 
 Document Journal (styled by Ludovic De Saint Sernin)\, as  well as adorni
 ng the cover of DJ Mag’s April ’23 edition.Now the D.O.G. EP sets the 
 scene for a hotly anticipated album in 2024\, but in the mean time there
 ’s only going to be more sweat-slicked style coming through from one of 
 the brightest talents to shine his light on deepest\, darkest night music.

 oors8 PM – Show\n \nTRACE MOUNTAINS\n“And you’re off into the burni
 ng blue” songwriter Dave Benton sings on “Ponies\,” the centerpiece 
 of Trace Mountains’ fourth full-length album Into the Burning Blue. Deco
 rated with retro textures and violet flowers\, the album begins with the c
 rackle of a fire\, as if something is burning and hatching into a new form
 . As Benton grappled with the end of an 8-year romantic relationship\, son
 gs were pouring out of him in quick succession\, often urgently before he 
 had logically processed the emotions himself. Collectively\, the songs ar
 e imbued with a spectrum of weighted emotions\, but the blue continued to 
 burn\, with each song adopting its respective hue — a violet reclaiming 
 of passion\, a deep sea blue of sorrow\, the sky blue moments of relief an
 d liberation when he comes up for air and sees hope on the horizon. The pr
 essure of this period crystallized Benton’s adventurous spirit and self-
 renewal as he embraced new high-fidelity sounds and conviction. Writing ro
 utinely over a Roland CR-68 drum machine and enamored with the dramatic pr
 ecision of 80s music\, Benton enlisted Craig Hendrix (Japanese Breakfast) 
 to bring his indie rock to immersive new heights.Out of Hendrix’s Philad
 elphia studio “The Well\,” the two employed synth-laden\, reverberatin
 g atmospheres that enter the frame like layers of supernatural silk. The e
 nd result is a pensive and playful collection of songs that gallop along F
 leetwood Mac pop grooves with sharp melodies and signature 80s gated snare
  (á la Phil Collins). The album still tumbles through Benton’s endearin
 g observations\, maintaining the candor that’s drawn people to his songw
 riting since his early work with indie rock band LVL UP.\n \nLONG BEARD\n
 Means To Me is the second full-length under Leslie Bear’s moniker\, Long
  Beard\, and her first since 2015’s Sleepwalker. Throughout the record\,
  Leslie explores what constitutes a home — how it extends beyond the phy
 sicality of a roof over your head to the comfort of another person. A sens
 e of self\, stability or security.\n \nThe last four years between record
 s mark a particularly significant and transitional time for Bear. A career
  move led her back to her hometown in New Jersey long after her friends an
 d peers moved away\, resulting in feelings of stasis and nostalgia that sh
 ape the album. Reflections on the past are evident in tracks like album si
 ngle “Sweetheart”\, in which Bear considers a past love\, where they a
 re now\, and her life in relation to theirs.\n \nCARMEN PERRY\nCarmen Per
 ry lives in Philadelphia and has spent the last ten years writing\, singin
 g\, and playing guitar in Remember Sports. Her debut solo record will be r
 eleased in Spring 2025. \n

 oors8 PM – Show\nSHEER MAGUnderlying every great record\, every career-d
 efining work of art\, is a certain ineffable\, increasingly rarified quali
 ty: unity of vision. Great songs need not announce their greatness: their 
 marriage of idea with action\, soul with sound\, appears as something whic
 h is naturally effortless\, unforced—they are what they are because they
  have no choice but to be. On Playing Favorites\, Sheer Mag’s third full
  length and first with Third Man Records\, this precise\, matured clarity 
 of vision is put on full display. Over the course of the past decade\, She
 er Mag have labored to carve out a discernibly singular position within th
 e canon of contemporary rock: toggling with ease between the refined flour
 ishes of a “connoisseur’s band” and the ecstatic colloquialism of po
 pulist songwriting—yet displaying no strict loyalty to either camp—the
 ir sound\, while oft-referenced\, is unmistakably and immediately recogniz
 able as theirs alone. With Playing Favorites\, Sheer Mag have capitalized 
 on a decade’s worth of devotion to their own collective spirit—a spiri
 t refined in both the sweaty trenches of punk warehouses and the larger-th
 an-life glamour of concert halls—emerging with a dense work of gripping 
 emotions\, massive hooks\, and masterfully constructed power-pop anthems. 
 This is the record the Philadelphian rock and roll four-piece has always b
 een destined to make.\nTHE OUT-SECTThe members of The Out-Sect all met whi
 le living in a Philadelphia junkyard. On weekends\, they would gather to d
 rink beers inside a broken down 1982 GMC Caballero with a copy of Back Fro
 m The Grave stuck in the car’s cassette player. Instantly being drawn to
  the trashy sounds of those pimple-faced mid-60s punks\, they figured they
  could write a song half as good as any of them. And that’s just what th
 ey did! Using instruments they found in the trash\, the band has managed t
 o write a handful of deranged “songs” that will leave you asking yours
 elf “What is that smell?” and “Dear god\, can they just stop playing
 ?”\nHAPPY BODYPhiladelphia\, PA\n

 oors8 PM – Show\nBLITZEN TRAPPER\nThere are numbers so vast they exceed 
 the scope of human reckoning\, concepts so immeasurable they surpass our c
 apacity to understand. On their radiant new album\, 100’s of 1000’s\, 
 Millions of Billions\, Blitzen Trapper make peace with the unknowable\, su
 rrendering themselves to forces beyond their control as they explore the i
 nfinite with a broad mind and an open heart. Inspired by singer/songwrite
 r Eric Earley’s fascination with Buddhist texts and meditation (the titl
 e comes from a phrase that appears over and over in the Mahayana sutras)\,
  the album offers a captivating take on rebirth and transcendence\, and th
 e circularity of existence\, navigating its way through the space beyond d
 reams and reality\, beyond gods and mortals\, beyond life and death. The s
 ongs here are as sincere as they are surreal\, rooted in rich character st
 udies and deep reflection\, and unfolding like a riddle-filled journey tha
 t asks many questions and offers no answers. The production is intoxicatin
 g to match\, blending lo-fi intimacy and trippy psychedelia into a mesmeri
 zing swirl of analog and electronic sounds. Add it all together and the re
 sult is a gorgeous\, sprawling collection wrapped in lush layers of synthe
 sizers and washed out electric guitars–a poignant\, expansive exploratio
 n of perception and purpose that manages to look both forwards and backwar
 ds all at once. “This whole project grew out of a box of old four-track
  tapes from the ’90s that I found recently\,” Earley explains of 100
 ’s of 1000’s\, Millions of Billions. “The tapes were full of songs I
 ’d written and recorded back when I was 19 or 20 years old\, and the sou
 nd and the spirit of those recordings got me excited to start writing musi
 c again\, to go back to working the way I did when I was first starting ou
 t.”\nLOUISA STANCIOFF\n“There are times in life when you’re so prese
 nt\, so fully immersed in the moment that you can catch a glimpse of anoth
 er universe\, of a realm beyond our own\,” says Louisa Stancioff. “It 
 might last for a second or an hour\, it might come in the midst of bliss o
 r sadness\, you might be alone or with a lover\, but when it happens\, the
 re’s nothing quite like it.” When We Were Looking\, Stancioff’s stu
 nning debut\, is full of those moments. Written and recorded through a tra
 nsitional\, transient period filled with heartbreak and uncertainty\, the 
 collection is raw and unflinching\, holding nothing back in its bitterswee
 t reckonings with pain\, healing\, acceptance\, and growth. Stancioff writ
 es with a cinematic eye\, conjuring up richly detailed stagings for her em
 otionally- charged character studies sung with a silvery resonance. The so
 ngs’ guitar-and-synth-focused arrangements are immersive and nuanced to 
 match\, thanks in part to the evocative sonic landscaping of producer/keyb
 oardist Sam Kassirer (Josh Ritter\, Craig Finn)\, who proves to be an idea
 l creative foil on the record. Add it all up and you’ve got a dreamy\, n
 ostalgic\, snapshot-filled album that blurs the lines between indie stoici
 sm and folk sincerity–a lush\, cathartic work that hints at everything f
 rom Phoebe Bridgers and Arlo Parks to Big Thief and Waxahatchee as it lear
 ns to find the beauty in grief and rebirth.\n

 two-headed monster\, Finom (fka Ohmme). You can ask them to go into more d
 etail about the boring reasons why they changed their name\, but for now\,
  the answer is going to be polite refusal. No.Co-fronted by Sima Cunningha

 put a premium on change. Produced by Jeff Tweedy in the Wilco Loft\, Not G
 od is a marvel of growth\, a progression from the roots of this collaborat
 ive band whose history can be traced back to its improvised conception. Th
 is is owed in no small part to their hometown of Chicago\, the life raft t

 inom’s dramatic vocal and musical gifts puts them in the peripheries of 
 the legacies cemented by The Roches\, Roxy Music\, the B52s\, Kate Bush\, 
 Cate Le Bon\, and Wilco.Cunningham and Stewart are brilliant harmonizers\,
  but harmony doesn’t equate to a utopia. In Finom’s maws harmony can a
 lso be a fight\, holding the line until the volcano erupts. This realistic
  depiction of a creative relationship jolts throughout the songs of Not Go
 d\, and brings the whole damn thing to life. Finom are more than one perso
 n with more than one dream. But still\, they grow together\, harnessed by 
 their shared love of pop songwriting\, control\, chaos\, and being general
 ly freaky-deaky. Freaky in that way that is only really fun when you’re 
 doing it with a friend. As the globe spins and advancements advance\, it c

  of Admittance is captured once again in the intricate tangle of the fretb
 oards\, soaring in open skies above. Like lens flare cutting through the s
 peakers\; spiderwebs cracking the windshield that holds back all the onrus
 hing reality. Blowing the dust away\, cutting a new path for cognition. As
  is always endeavored…. After 20 years of living on the road in differe
 nt places\, Six Organs of Admittance had returned home to Humboldt County 
 — a far country\, to some\, but still part o f the world through which c
 reatures of all kinds are moving through and contributing to. And some of 
 them are human. Alone together — forming connection and exchange out of 
 thought and expression — no different from the people on the other side 
 of the Redw ood Curtain. It was there\, where Six Organs had long ago emer
 ged\, in the name of everything cycling\, of circles that spiral concentri
 cally and remain unbroken\, the new music was conceived. In moments\, it 
 was as if the future had some – how wrapped around 360 degrees\; elsewhe
 re\, the systems and patterns inside the writing and recording only became
  evident later — like a recognition that cumulus and nimbus clouds which
  passed through the sky the day before contained familiar shapes. Informin

 and lyrical\, threading backward through the time of Six Organs of Admitta
 nce. Almost marinating in it as a way of life. Working on the music and th
 e vocals\, then spending some time with them while steppin g away from the
 m. Walking the dog and coming back to them. Time is Glass is made of that 
 kind of time. Alone time. Recorded in the visceral environs of home\, Tim
 e is Glass is sharply focused\, even as misty impressionist mountains floa
 t through the background. Sweet and spiny\, “ The Mission ” sings its 
 purpose\, before turning abruptly to the orchestral rumble of “ Hephaest
 us ”: rural industrial psychedelia\, ecosystem goth\, synths arcing to l
 ift a helplessly earthbound community into the firmament above. Winding al
 most imperceptibly back into song with “ Slip Away ”\, the time of the
  record becomes clear\, moves fluidly\, relaxed but aware\, from event to 
 event. People and things coming around again. The intuit\, passing through
  wormholes and time\, sounding deep then dissolving into the universal. Th
 e acoustic sounds ringing\, layered suddenly\, then clear again. Explosion
 s of a new kind of distortion. Ecstatic melodies. Communing. The space of 
 a day. The space of a season. Time is Glass\, and Six Organs of Admittanc 
 e is here and will be here\, again.\nTASHI DORJITashi Dorji  is a Bhutane

 Brad Cook in the border town of Tornillo\, TX. The guest list includes Wax
 ahatchee’s Katie Crutchfield\, who trades verses with King on the album
 ’s title track\, and Drive-By Truckers co-founder Patterson\, who delive
 rs a spoken-word monologue during “Soft Drugs.” A brass section even m
 akes a brief appearance. The result is a bold blend of old and new\, deliv
 ered by a band of brothers who’ve never sounded so invigorated. Easy com
 pany\, indeed.\nCOLOR GREEN\nFor the California-based quartet Color Green\
 , playing music together is all about stepping into the unknown. “When w
 e play live\, I don’t really know what’s going to happen\,” says Noa
 h Kohll\, one of the band’s two guitarists and four vocalists. “You re
 ally have no idea what you’re going to get with this band\, which keeps 
 things fresh for us and maybe makes the live experience special.” In a v
 ery short time\, they have developed a word-of-mouth reputation as a dynam
 ic and unpredictable live act\, grounding their cosmic jams in earthy melo
 dies and drawing from ’60s SoCal folk-r0ck\, ’70s classic rock\, ’80
 s underground rock\, ’90s psychedelic dance-rock\, and any other sound t
 hat catches their ears.\n

 above a slow-burn\, sparse synth\, conjuring a tipsy loneliness\, a hazy r
 ecollection\, a disco ball spinning at the end of the night for an empty d
 ance floor. Sun June’s music often feels like a shared memory – the de
 tails so close to the edge of a song that you can touch them. And as an Au
 stin-based project\, their music has also always felt strangely and specif
 ically Texan – unhurried\, long drives across an impossible expanse of o
 penness\, refractions shimmering off the pavement in the heat.But on Bad D
 ream Jaguar\, Sun June is unmoored. The backdrop of Texas is replaced by l
 onging\, by distance\, by transience\, and a quiet fear. The only sense of
  certainty comes from the murky past. It’s a dispatch from aging\, when 
 you’re in the strange in-between of yourself: there’s a clear image of
  the person you once were and the places you inhabited\, generational curs
 es and our families\, but the future feels vast\, unclear – and the pres

 DOORS\n9PM SHOW\n \nDIRTY DOLLHOUSE \n\nDirty Dollhouse is the multi-gen
 re music of Philadelphia-based artist Chelsea Mitchell\, a folk chanteuse 
 with classical training and a retro-pop composer with a soft spot for cou
 ntry. After releasing her first lo-fi EP\, Married in the Aviary\, Mitchel
 l received the Tri-State Indie Vocalist of the Year award and the lyrics t
 o her song “Nobody’s Daughter” were showcased in American Songwriter
  Magazine. Joined by light accompaniment for a follow-up EP\, 25 Shades\, 
 saw a departure from traditional folk and embraced a Nashville vibe while 
 2017’s full-length album Vinyl Child was a mixture of darkly contemplati
 ve pop songs and quiet\, intimate confession. Drawing from many muses has
  produced a uniquely diverse catalogue\, but it has also made it near-impo
 ssible to pin down who Mitchell sounds like. In sultry-toned moments you m
 ight hear Nicole Atkins\, a soft bird-like peak could make you think of Ka
 cey Musgraves\, and a certain belt may summon Brandi Carlile. Though her v
 ocals range from soft twang to unabashedly operatic\, it could suffice to 
 say that Mitchell’s songs all fit under the same “singer-songwriter”
  umbrella as her lyrics weave a diary page to life and her band expands on
  structural simplicity with subtle grace. As bassist Joshua Machiz\, drumm
 er Eric Lawry\, and lead guitarist August John Lutz II are now full-time m
 embers\, Dirty Dollhouse has found a new and exciting momentum\, opening f
 or rising stars like Nikki Lane and Amanda Shires and playing to a wider a
 udience.\n \nBREN\nBren is a Philadelphia\, PA based singer/songwriter wr
 iting cathartic pop tunes from a punk heart. Having moved over 10 times in
  her life\, dropped out of college\, ended and started new relationships\,
  Bren knows a thing or two about unexpected change. Breaking through self-
 doubt is a common theme throughout her writing. Distilling influences rang
 ing from Elliott Smith to Mitski to the Pixies\, Bren’s music shares fam
 iliar sentiments of vulnerability and introspection\, serving as your comp
 anion for feelings you may not have even realized you had.\n \nDOMINY\n\n

 nsidered as having followed a tangential path from Hendrix to Big Star to 
 Spacemen 3\, that would be The Bevis Frond… and that’s not hyperbole\,
  the evidence is to be found in countless albums over 30 years of thrillin
 g musical innovation that few have matched. Filtered through The Groundhog
 s\, The Who\, Neil Young\, Captain Beefheart and Kevin Ayers\, this is an 
 iconoclastic collision of distinctly British psychedelia\, space-rock\, gr
 unge\, slow-burning soulful laments\, even grizzled folk and more than occ
 asional moments of sublime pop genius. Yet\, he remains the best kept secr
 et in Rock ‘n’ Roll – isn’t it about time you discovered one of En
 gland’s finest songwriters and insightful lyricists. The Bevis Frond is 
 guitarist and songwriter extraordinaire Nick Saloman who’s prolific outp
 ut has seen him hailed as “a Hendrix devotee ever bit as tough and conte
 mporary as the serrated guitar chorales of Sonic Youth and Pixies” by Ro
 lling Stone’s David Fricke and become a cult figure in his own right.\n

  how we deal with life itself and why so many seem to be drawn toward unhe
 althy coping mechanisms. While a few tracks address these themes head on

 band ended\, they recruited drummer Kim Åge Furuhaug\, one of Holm’s lo
 ngtime friend and collaborators\, to join their new project.The three met 
 in Bergen\, located along the west coast of Norway\, to start working on i

  their entire first album\, Mint. From there\, the universe propelled them
  forward\, resulting in a record deal\, their live debut as a band at Norw
 ay’s biggest pop festival Øyafestivalen and the release of their debut 
 record all happening within the following year. Mint drew international in

 record “an eclectic fusion of disparate styles and exciting sounds that 
 says what it wants to say through memorable melodies\, ambient drones\, an
