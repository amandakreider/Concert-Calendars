 – Doors8PM – Show\nBRACKISH (10:00 PM)\nBrackish released their self-t
 itled debut album in May 2022. After steadily releasing EP’s\, singles\,
  and touring the East Coast and Midwest\, the band felt ready to take on a
  new challenge they had yet to face. After recording two songs (“What Ma
 kes You Say”\, “For Your Own Good”) with Ace Enders (The Early Novem
 ber)\, to get a feel for the process\, Brackish recorded the other ten son
 gs for their album on their own in their practice space in South Jersey. R
 ecorded by drummer and lead guitarist\, Zach Miller and Tim Fitzpatrick\, 
 mixed by the band\, and mastered by Noise War Sound. Featuring Riley Byrne
  on keyboards and strings. The stream-of-consciousness style lyrics\, catc
 hy bass lines\, ethereal leads\, and dynamic drums act as the watermark Br
 ackish takes with them as they move forward. \n \n \n \nLATEWAVES (9:00 
 PM)\n\n \nLATEWAVES was born on a warm New Jersey morning in 2016. Waking 
 up on the beach after a long night\, Shawna Grabowski (drums) and Mike Pe
 llegrino (guitars/vox) decided to finally take action on their pact to st
 art a band. After accosting longtime friend Howie Cohen *(bass/vox)*\, an
 d a few EP’s and tours later\, the band decided to put everything they h
 ad into creating their first full length \, Hell to Pay\, with the help o
 f Brett Romnes (producer of Free Throw\, Heart Attack Man\, Hot Mulligan\
 , Seaway) and Vinnie Caruana (The Movielife\, I Am the Avalanche).\n \n\n
  \nMAXWELL STERN (8:00 PM) \nMaxwell Stern proves himself as a veteran son
 gwriter with his debut LP Impossible Sum. It’s a folk-rock record for th
 e people that features a roundup of artists like Laura Stevenson\, Adam Be
 ck (Into It. Over It\, Sincere Engineer)\, and more. Inspired by musicians
  like Tom Petty\, The Weakerthans\, and Jets To Brazil\, Impossible Sum ex
 plores the interconnected nature of life that we often look over.\n\n\n \n

  \nGreat Time doesn’t want to fit in a box. Living up to their name\, t
 he band just wants to have a great time making the music they want. Tired 
 of being advised to “pick a lane” by some of their industry peers\, Gr
 eat Time sets out to create music that celebrates their wide-ranging sound
 \, incorporating genres like synth-pop\, electronic\, jazz\, punk\, rock a
 nd R&B. Their most recent releases are a series of EPs titled “Sounds Li
 ke ____”. The band had the idea to turn the EP titles into a Mad Libs ty
 pe of game “so that someone could put their own adjective or descriptor 
 for the EP in the blank space\,” explains singer/multi-instrumentalist J
 ill Ryan. The projects explore some of the different sounds and styles tha
 t influence Great Time. “Some people thought [our 2018 debut LP] Great A
 lbum was all over the place\, so with the ‘Sounds Like’ series\, we de
 cided to lean even further into our multi-genre tendencies and place the o
 ption of categorizing or putting us in a box on the listener.” \n \n\n\

 e quintet’s sound takes wide-spectrum influence from its environment. Th
 e result is an amalgam of complex song structures and flourishes of techni
 cal acumen\, wholly unconcerned with genre\, yet evoking the specific styl
 es of touchstones such as Paramore and Circa Survive.\n \n \n

 – Doors9PM – Show\n \nGRACE IVES \nJanky Star is the new album from 
 pop-polymath Grace Ives\, following 2019’s critically acclaimed 2nd. A
 fter writing and doing initial production on this collection of songs at h
 ome in Brooklyn\, Ives teamed up with co-producer Justin Raisen (Yves Tumo
 r\, Charli XCX) in Los Angeles to consummate Janky Star’s expanded vis
 ion.  Still only in her mid-twenties\, the record sounds like Ives grown 
 up: through the ten sophisti-pop tracks\, there’s more deliberate space 
 that lends breathing room to her most vulnerable\, exposed songwriting yet
 .  Throughout songs that are still full of punchy synths and unconvention
 al rhythms\, Ives uses the quiet spaces in between to honestly reflect on 
 her ongoing struggle to find stability and happiness.  Touching on sobrie
 ty\, overdoses\, and the desire to escape from the realities of modern lif
 e\, the record also focuses on the rewards of slowing down\, and finally f
 inding a home for herself in the ever-shifting world.\n \nIves’ penchant
  for poetic musings on specific details and references has always been par
 t of her enchantment\, but on Janky Star she finally settles into an ima
 ge that’s entirely her own.   “Everyone has a shitty star tattoo/stic
 k n poke\, that’s never perfect\, or is rough around the edges. A beauti
 ful thing to think about is that stars on earth look like blobs but in spa
 ce really defined structures\,” she explains.  This fully-formed versio
 n of herself is the album’s guiding light\, and sees Ives take confident
  steps towards deciding her own fate.  Both self-possessed and yearning\,
  insular and affecting\, Janky Star’s effervescent daydreams are ultima
 tely triumphant\, where ultimately the very act of surviving can be the bi
 ggest achievement of all.\n

  – Show\nDave Kiss Presents\nD.R.I.  (10:00 PM)\n \nWe are a punk/metal
  crossover band with our roots set in hardcore. Established way back in 19
 82\, we have about 10 CD’s & 2 DVD’s out on various labels and are con
 sidered to be one of the forefathers of speed metal and thrash punk music.
  We started out in Texas and moved to the Bay Area cause we heard the SF a
 rea had free food at the soup kitchens (from which the classic tune was wr
 itten!!!!!)\nWhen we started our influences were bands like Black Flag and
  the Dead Kennedys. In 1982\, our first release\, which was really a demo\
 , the 22-song 7″ EP\, kickstarted our career as a formidable hardcore ba
 nd. 22 songs in 17 minutes. Blistering fast\, with on-the-dime cuts\, and 
 vocals to match. Said to contain the first grindcore blast ever recorded (
 No Sense). This record was later pressed into an LP\, and was considered t
 o be our first official release even though it was only 17 minutes. The 22
 -song debut eventually was combined with our second release\, 1984’s Vio
 lent Pacification EP\, and came out on CD in the mid-eighties\, when that 
 technology reached indie labels.\nIn 1985 we started to listen to bands li
 ke Metallica & Slayer. Our second full length release Dealing with It\, sh
 owed a progression to the metal side of the music genre. This album also w
 as said to make an impact\, and helped start the crossover movement. “We
  fused together our influences\, and shoved into the DRI mold\, Dealing Wi
 th It is what came out”. DRI went on mixing its own brand of punk metal 
 releasing: Crossover\, Four of a Kind\, Thrash Zone\, Definition\, a live 
 album recorded in 1992\, before releasing Full Speed Ahead in 1996 \; our 
 last full length release. We have been re-issuing our old catalog with bon
 us tracks for the new millennium. We also got a bunch of Live DVD’s in t
 he works\, starting with the 1984 CBGB’s live DVD that came out in 2005.
  Summer of 2016 saw the release of the first new material in years. But Wa
 it..THERE’s MORE came out as a 7″/12″ and CD.\nThe band currently co
 nsists of original core members and song writing team\, Spike Cassidy (gui
 tar) and Kurt Brecht (vocals)\, along with Gregg Orr (bass) and Rob Rampy 
 (drums).We are that band with the skanker in the circle. You know\, the ru
 nning man. The mosher. We appeared on a Beavis & Butthead episode. We also
  held the Guinness Book record for fastest band in the world\, back in the
  day. We played with just about every major band you can name\, and most f
 estivals in our travels around the world for over three decades. We now ha
 ve over 120 DRI songs under our belt\, and still play about 35 or so when 
 we play live.\nHONEY (9:00 PM)Originally\, Honey wasn’t conceived as a f
 ull band project. It was more of a solo projectto serve as “therapy” f
 or singer / guitarist\, Jay Laughlin (Turning Point\, Godspeed). AsJay put
 s it\, “I’ve been playing in bands non-stop since the 8th grade (1986)
 . In 2017\, Ihad a couple of back-to-back shitty situations which put me i
 nto a seriously darkdepression. I thought maybe it was time to take a step
  back from playing in a band andbook some studio time to make a record for
  myself… by myself.” These sessions wouldtake Laughlin back to his roo
 ts — the heavy metal and hardcore music that first caughthis ear and pos
 sessed him to pick up a guitar and write songs in the first place.\n

  – Show\nR5 Productions Presents\nAN EVENING WITH WAND AND GUESTSwith vi
 suals by Mad Alchemist\nWAND Wand formed in late 2013 in Los Angeles\, CA
  and got right to work playing\, writing\, and conceptualizing a contraria
 n path forward–the only viable trail to follow for a rock band that form
 ed in the twenty-teens (and audaciously named itself Wand). The original c
 onfiguration of the band was Cory Hanson (guitar\, vocals)\, Lee Landey (b
 ass)\, Evan Burrows (drums) and Daniel Martens (guitar). This was the grou
 p that recorded the neuroplastic\, dusk-colored Ganglion Reef. Upon heari
 ng it\, the suits at GOD? Records demanded the opportunity to release it\,
  and the rest became irrevocable historical fact in 2014. That debut relea
 se launched a year of furious activity and near-constant touring\, and inc
 luded the recording and release of both their second and third albums: the
  strobing sledgehammer Golem (on In the Red)\, and the psilocybe flicker
  show 1000 Days (on Drag City). During this time\, Daniel left to focus 
 on raising his son\, and the remaining three members of Wand regrouped as 
 a trio\, with an auxiliary fourth piece for tours.\n \nFollowing a dizzyin
 g 100+ dates played in North America and Europe in support of 1000 Days\,
  Wand took a six-month deep breath at the beginning of 2016. Cory put toge
 ther a string laden solo album\, The Unknown Capitalist From Limbo (rele
 ased later that year)\, and Evan focused on writing and touring with his b
 and Behavior. Meanwhile\, Wand’s barely-perceptible pause had a deeper a
 genda—Evan\, Lee and Cory had sensed the need for a new alignment\, a fa
 bulous new mutation of the body Wand. Sofia Arreguin and Robbie Cody were 
 recruited to play keyboards and guitar respectively\, with the intention o
 f reimagining the band’s approach to writing and performance. A period o
 f intense woodshedding ensued\, both in the practice space and on stages a
 round the world\, out of which the records Plum and “Perfume” emer
 ged.\n \nThe writing process that evolved during the tumultuous seasons of
  Plum and “Perfume” incorporated a new emphasis on econo-jamming a
 nd democratic decision-making\; another new method of invention\, another 
 new mode of digestion. Plum dropped in the fall of 2017\, “Perfume”
  in the spring of 2018. With the success of this music\, the band forged 
 on with confidence\, stockpiling dozens of pieces and working them togethe
 r as a unit. They made the most of their 2018\, taking in deep bubbles of 
 time to tinker and experiment with their sound\, using several different s
 paces as well as their own home studio\, and patiently uncovering the exci
 ting alchemical balance that would bring all this work together as a whole
 . By the turn of autumn\, Wand had arrived at the width and breadth\, the 
 breathless wit of their new album—Laughing Matter.\n \nMAD ALCHEMIST LIQ

 9PM – Show\nWXPN Welcomes\n \nS.G. GOODMAN\n“No one escapes the marks 
 left behind when it comes to love or the absence of it\,” says singer-so
 ngwriter S.G. Goodman\, describing the inspiration behind her sophomore al
 bum Teeth Marks. “Not only are we the ones who bear its indentations\, b
 ut we’re also the ones responsible for placing them on ourselves and oth
 ers.”   When the Kentucky native released her debut album\, Old Time F
 eeling\, she was rightly coined an “untamed rock n roll truth-teller” 
 by Rolling Stone. The roots-inflected rock n’ roll record saw Goodman le
 nding her gritty\, haunting vocals to narrate the dual perspectives of her
  upbringing as the daughter of a crop farmer\, and a queer woman coming ou
 t in a rural town.  Now with Teeth Marks\, co-produced by Drew Vandenber
 g (Faye Webster\, Drive-By Truckers\, Of Montreal) in Athens\, Georgia\, s
 he picks up the threads of Old Time Feeling. But where her critically accl
 aimed\, Jim James-produced debut zeroed in on the South\, reframing miscon
 ceptions in slough water-soaked tones\, her latest album pulses with downt
 own Velvet Underground electricity\, shifting its focus inward – though 
 never losing Goodman’s searing and universal point of view. Teeth Marks 
 is what you might get if Flannery O’Connor and Lou Reed went on a road t
 rip.  Drawing influences from the aforementioned Velvets\, as well as Pa
 vement\, Karen Dalton\, and Chad VanGaalen\, Goodman brings 11 powerful vi
 gnettes to life\, with a sound that ventures deeper into indie rock and pu
 nk territory than she ever has before. Though Teeth Marks is a love album\
 , Goodman doesn’t aim her focus on romantic relationships alone. Instead
 \, she analyzes the way love between communities\, families\, and even one
 ’s self can be influenced by trauma that lingers in the body. Teeth Mark
 s is about what love actually is\, love’s psychological and physical imp
 rint\, its light\, and its darkness. It’s a record about the love we hav
 e or don’t have for each other\, and perhaps\, more significantly\, the 
 love we have or don’t have for ourselves. \n \nLE REN \n\n

 al new voices in alternative music\, having gone from being darlings of th
 e DIY underground to one of the UK’s most thrilling bands in the space o
 f less than a year. Their barbed wit\, lacerating intensity and potent ble
 nd of art-rock\, indie-pop and post-punk sounds like little else around\, 
 and led their 2020 album Every Bad to make the nominees list for the covet
 ed Mercury Music Prize.\n \nFor frontperson Dana Margolin\, drummer Sam Ya
 rdley\, keyboardist Georgie Stott and bassist Maddie Ryall – who met in 
 the seaside town of Brighton and formed Porridge Radio in 2014 – global 
 recognition has been a long time coming\, after years of self-releasing an
 d music booking their own tours. In those eight years\, Dana has gained a 
 reputation as one of the most magnetic band leaders around with an ability
  to “devastate you with an emotional hurricane\, then blindside you with
  a moment of bittersweet humour” (NME). \n \nBut if Every Bad establish
 ed Dana’s lemon-sharp\, heart-on-sleeve honesty\, Porridge Radio’s thi
 rd album takes that to anthemic new heights. Waterslide\, Diving Board\, L
 adder To The Sky is the sound of someone in their late twenties facing dow
 n the disappointment of love\, and life\, and figuring out how to exist in
  the world\, without claiming any answers. It’s also catchy as hell.\nSE

 ond proper full-length\, childhood and adulthood coalesce to display his m
 ost confident and animated work to date. A Jump from the High Dive is a bu
 ndle of energy through a focused lens\, each song reminiscent of the stand
 out track on a gifted mix CD. \nAfter Sean returned home to suburban Conne
 cticut in 2019 (“New York had broken up with me”)\, he adopted a “re
 ligious 9 to 5” mentality: working on the record and listening to old hi
 p-hop and ‘90s alternative CDs in his car. “I was doing a lot of couch
  surfing\, living where I grew up in a Connecticut ghost town and touring 
 around the country. I was all over the place. Amidst trying to sort things
  out\, I wanted to make my version of a pop album.”\n

  \nBonny Doon emerged in 2014\, its four members pivoting away from their 
 punk origins to create something restrained and steeped in contemplation. 
 Songwriters Bill Lennox and Bobby Colombo expanded their ongoing collabora
 tion to include drummer Jake Kmiecik and bassist Joshua Brooks. From there
  Bonny Doon took form\, developing a sound indebted as much to musical tou
 chstones like Neil Young and the Silver Jews as it was to the emotional la
 ndscapes of their always changing hometown of Detroit.\n \nThe group recor
 ded what became a self-titled 7” in the summer of 2014\, tracked by Fred
  Thomas in his living room. A tape of 4-track demos\, “Classical Days an
 d Jazzy Nights\,” followed in 2015\, before reenlisting Thomas to record
  their texturally dense debut LP\, which melded their penchant for time-ho
 nored songcraft with production heavy on tape-delay and glowing\, roomy so
 nics. The album was released on Salinas in early 2017\, as the band was al
 ready deep into work on material for a follow-up. Working in a studio for 
 the first time\, they captured a more spare and vulnerable sound and signe
 d on with Woodsist to release the resultant album\, Longwave.\nTHE GOODBY
 E PARTY\n \nOver the last eight years\, the Goodbye Party has remained a 
 hidden gem to devoted fans. The music of Michael Cantor\, the Philadelphia
 -based musician behind the project\, has been a well-kept secret that hold
 s the sacredness of loss close to the heart through classic pop ballads\, 
 atmospheric soundscapes\, cassette tape noise\, swirling guitars\, and an 
 affinity for staying present in the dark corners of our minds. On October 
 9\, 2020\, the Goodbye Party will release their sophomore album\, Beautifu

 d of Cameron Lew\, who manages to not only be the figurehead of the projec
 t\, but also writes\, records\, produces\, directs\, and edits every aspec
 t of the project. While the nontraditional approach may have lead to a mor
 e gradual growth of the project it has resulted in Ginger Root gaining a d
 evoted fanbase.\n \nAfter releasing their sophomore album\, Rikki\, in 202
 0 with much of it feeling lost to the moments of that year Lew decided to 
 take a step back and try to write a succinct project to try and keep liste
 ners engaged for as long as possible. The result of this redirection of en
 ergy was paired with a newfound influence from Japanese art and culture af
 ter Lew immersed himself while learning to speak the language. All of this
  was packaged and delivered on City Slicker in 2021. \n \nWith this batch
  of songs Ginger Root finally saw his hard work pay off in a major way. Th
 e project connected with a massive audience on the internet\, and resulted
  in songs like Juban District and Loretta exploding. Ginger Root’s inter
 net presence grew steadily as well with his youtube amassing 160\,000 subs
 cribers and his Spotify nearly hitting 1 million monthly listeners. \n \n
 The path to success did not come overnight\, but rather at a gradual pace.
  The project delivered it’s first album in collaboration with Acrophase 
 Record\, Mahjong Room\, in 2018 and really has not stopped since. Between 
 each project Ginger Root has played alongside tons of modern Indie standou
 ts like Khruangbin\, Durand Jones\, Omar Apollo\, The Marias\, and Hippo C
 ampus to name a few. \n \nNow Ginger Root sets out to deliver a complimen
 tary EP and continue to captivate fans with his rich visuals and lush soun
 ds that he seemingly never fails to deliver. The project at times feels mo
 re aptly consumed on VHS rather than vinyl. Nisemono arrives in September 
 of 2022 along with their first headline tour in America.\nKING PARI (8:00)
 \n \nKing Pari is an almost accidental project. Cameron Kinghorn and DJ St
 epmom (Joe Christensen) didn’t even set out to start a band. When Joe te
 xted Cameron some jams whipped up on his tape machine\, Cameron hit him ba
 ck with\, “What is this? I want in.” Ten minutes before they first met
  up\, Joe built the loop for their first single\, ‘Sunshine\,’ which t
 hey then wrote on the spot in a flurry of collective inspiration. Now the 
 duo’s collection of work has grown\, amassing millions of streams\, radi
 o play\, shows across the US\, and a fan base growing rapidly.\nKing Pari 
 is much more than this serendipitous start though. The project is the culm
 ination of Joe and Cameron’s years of hard work in the Minneapolis scene
 . Their musical talents afforded them opportunities few have experienced\,
  from being invited to play shows at Prince’s Paisley Park by Prince him
 self to performing with Prince’s band New Power Generation. The two draw
  inspiration from the “no limits” nature of the Minneapolis sound\, pu
 shing it forward as they see it today.\n

 ained deeply individual and steadfastly DIY. They have also grown into one
  of the most dynamic and devastating touring bands going today.\nOut Febru
 ary 23rd\, All At Once is the trio’s most expansive and imaginative work
 s to date–a double LP that swings between surreal miniatures and solo-he
 avy sprawl. Concision takes a backseat to experimentation\, with arrangeme
 nts meant to evoke the energy and spontaneity of their live shows. It’s 
 music built across a timeline that’s longer than our internet-enhanced m
 oment typically tolerates and a testament to the band’s dedication and p
 erseverance.\nGHÖSH\n \nGhösh is a disco cabal\, a “political party”
  if you dig what we’re saying\, a band– they’re a wild sonic collage
 \, a quasi post-grunge\, post-industrial mash-up\, all wrapped up in the c
 haos and entropic funk of a warped and screwed Public Enemy demo tape and 
 a fax machine shredded in a Cuisinart. Their songs are an iridescent kind 
 of noisy digital alchemy layered in dense charging breakbeats and splatter
 ed in raucous dayglo\, laser-beamed transmissions from the future at the l
 ast protest march of the revolution. \nSymphony Spell (vocals/lyrics) and
  Zachary Fairbrother (various instruments/samplers)\, the two cyborgs that
  form Ghösh\, bonded over their love for jungle\, techno\, rap and nu met
 al to create songs that bang in tantric visions of sight and sound. Their 
 aesthetic is ripped from the screenshots of Republican nightmares and proj
 ected wide in shimmering hologram\, scored by the last dancefloor clearing
  sound blasts from a party on Cybertron\, all couched in the lyrical inten
 sity of a 2008 myspace page co-owned by Audre Lorde and Missy Elliot.\nTHE
  IREThe Ire is a post-punk group originating in Philadelphia\, started by
  guitarist Florence Lin in late 2017. Joined by Ashley Tini (drums)\, Maya
  Brooks (vocals)\, and Daniel Cox (bass)\, The Ire released their demo in
  early 2019\, and have since impressed audiences across the country with t
 heir romantic mixture of rage and passion\; packaged in the nostalgia of a
 n 80s goth and anarcho-punk sound. \n \n \n \nThe release of their debut 
 LP “What Dreams May Come” (June 6th on Play Alone Records) provides a 
 bridge from the early demos into a clear maturation of style and content\,
  as themes such as racial struggle\, societal collapse are echoed from ear
 ly recordings as well as more personal responses to the weight of our curr
 ent world. All coming together under a rallying cry of resistance that res
 onates defiantly with each track.\n\n\n\n\n

 were the biggest rock band in Zambia in the 1970s and spearheaded a new ge
 nre dubbed Zamrock\, fusing influences that ranged from the Rolling Stones
  to Black Sabbath and James Brown and mixing them with traditional African
  rhythms and bush village songs. At t the peak of their popularity\, the b
 and often needed police to keep fans at bay while their lead singer Jagari
  – whose name is an Africanisation of Mick Jagger’s – riled up crowd
 s by stage diving from balconies and dancing manically as the WITCH’s bl
 end of psychedelic rock and African rhythms permeated the surrounding atmo
 sphere.\n \nJagari is the charismatic sole surviving original member of th
 e band. As Zambia’s economy stagnated and the country buckled under the 
 AIDS crisis\, WITCH fell apart. Jagari retreated to a life of quasi-anonym
 ity as a university music professor before being wrongfully arrested durin
 g Zambia’s toughest hour. Now a man in his 60s\, he spends his time mini
 ng gemstones hoping to strike it rich\, until very recently the band being
  just a nostalgic memory of his youth.\n \nLargely unknown outside of thei
 r home country\, WITCH finally got the exposure they deserved when Now Aga
 in Records reissued their entire discography in 2012. This allowed Jagari 
 to play outside Africa for the first time and for a new generation of fans
  to discover his music. In 2016 he began a collaboration with Dutch musici
 ans Jacco Gardner and Nic Mauskoviç\, and together with them\, in Septemb
 er 2017 WITCH headed out on its extremely successful first-ever European T

 guitarist for Los Angeles’ Allah-Las\, Pedrum Siadatian has etched out a
  place of his own with his solo work as PAINT.  What started as modest 4-
 track experiments quickly took on a life of their own as Pedrum began dist
 illing his musical and lyrical inspirations into something both timeless a
 nd new. His miniature menagerie of light-psych and proto-punk gems had out
 grown their cassette cage and were now ready to be heard.\nPAINT’s epony
 mous debut (Mexican Summer\, 2018) appeared out of the ether\, fully forme
 d. It was praised for its originality and drew favorable comparisons to th
 e likes of Kevin Ayers\, Lou Reed and Julian Cope. The mess was the messag
 e and the decidedly mid-fi production found Siadatian both honoring and es
 chewing tradition. The album was accompanied by videos for the singles “
 Daily Gazette” and “Moldy Man\,” both directed by Sam Kristofski (Co

  – Show\nTHE BALLROOM THIEVES\nEarly in 2020\, an article was released d
 eclaring that the music industry needed more happy songs. As Martin Earley
  and Calin Peters recall\, they laughed while reading it\, knowing that th
 eir work as The Ballroom Thieves explores the spirit of that paradigm. Wel
 l\, sort of…they’re not interested in easily defined worldviews.\n \n
 “We read that article and thought\, ‘how are we supposed to write happ
 y songs right now?'” says Earley. “We don’t write happy songs\, but 
 this time we decided to try something new by pairing optimistic sounding m
 usic with dark lyrics. If the listener is not a lyrics person\, they might
  not notice.”\n \nThe Ballroom Thieves’ fourth album\, Clouds\, is a 
 song cycle born of mixed experiences and fueled by the power of imaginatio
 n. The album is a lush meditation on longing to return to touring – to
  see different sunsets and cities. But\, it’s also a reflection of its d
 ifficulties\, e.g.\, insomnia brought on by sleeping in different hotel ro
 oms every night. After a major car accident and the departure of a band me
 mber\, the duo has taken the duality of all these experiences and translat

 r is a Philadelphia-based musician. She composes music for a variety of in
 struments\, and is currently working on a synth-based film score for her f

 has performed in many bands and projects that have regularly recorded and 
 toured across the US and Canada\, including Palberta\, an art punk/pop tri
 o of 9 years that has released eight albums and toured prolifically\, open
 ing for Bikini Kill and Deerhoof\, among many other groups. When Nina is n
 ot composing or performing in bands\, she records and performs as her self
 -titled\, pop-leaning solo project\, which consists of lush synth composit
 ions accompanied by vocals and electronics. She regularly performs across 
 the country\, and has released six solo albums\, all home-recorded. Her la
 test album\, Paths of Color\, is her sixth solo album: “In line with her
  past few releases\, Paths of Color is characteristic Nina Ryser: dreamy\,
  wonky\, synth-based art-pop that’s bubbly\, edgy\, sweet\, and dark all
  at once\; with elements of post-punk\, art rock\, and free jazz. But on P
 aths\, Ryser has honed her home recording and mixing skills and refined he
 r home studio set-up\, making it her most polished-sounding work yet. But 
 she’s maintained that homemade vibe\, as well as the freedom of childhoo
 d expression that is so crucial to her sound. Her background in contempora
 ry classical music serves to hold it all together in a taut\, designful ba
 lance.” (Leah Mandel\, Cowgirl Records)\n

 OUNG JESUS (8:00 PM)\n \nThe music of Young Jesus has always been about ch
 ange. Bandleader and sole original member John Rossiter is a restless spir
 it\, always moving\, always seeking new sounds\, new thoughts\, new method
 s of working. Young Jesus’ new album Shepherd Head is a dramatic departu
 re for the band\, delving deeper into the themes that have always fascinat
 ed Rossiter—love\, heartbreak\, God—approached in a completely new dir
 ection. It’s a record of growth and exploration\, pushing forward into t
 he future with hope while still holding the pain and regrets of the past\,
  seeking a balance for the present.\n \nYoung Jesus began when John Rossit
 er dropped out of college after doing acid with two of his high school fri
 ends and decided to join their band. After several albums\, he moved to L.
 A. with the intention of never playing music again. However\, the new envi
 ronment woke something up in Rossiter\, and he began to write music at a f
 urious pace\, recruiting a new band to explore this new evolution in sound
 . That time for Young Jesus was marked by experimentation and improvisatio
 n\, as the band toured and put out three records with Saddle Creek.\n \nA 
 few years later\, the band had drifted apart from too much time on the roa
 d\, and Rossiter became restless. After the tragic death of a close friend
 \, Rossiter felt a need for change. “I can be kind of a perfectionist an
 d a pretty intense band member\,” says Rossiter. “I drove the band rea
 lly hard for a while\, and I don’t think I realized how hard I was doing
  that. Everyone was just burnt out on me and on each other. And I think I 
 had wanted to reflect on that more\, why I did push so hard and why I coul
 d be so demanding and stubborn.”\n \n \n

  – Show\nTY SEGALL (Solo Acoustic)\nThe man in the tree has a guitar\, h
 e’s gonna sing. But the sun shining through the branches— are those ra
 ys yellow or hazy gray? What day is today? When are you not going to feel 
 this way again?\n“Hello\, Hi”: welcome in to a new room to play the st
 yles and feels that lie under Ty Segall’s fingers\, easing fresh air int
 o acoustic space with an assortment of love songs flowering in righteous u
 nconsciousness. Plaintive and wistful\, but unafraid. Like rain washing aw
 ay yesterday\, “Hello\, Hi” pushes open the door\, inviting the new to
  pass through all the old shades and degrees of hot and cold. Dark paths t
 urn off abruptly into absurd darkness\, then wind back through the broken 
 rocks\, ecstatic again. Absurdity again. It happens everyday.\n“Hello\, 
 Hi” is expansively rendered by Ty\, mostly by himself\, at home. The iso
 lation suits the songs: you’re only ever as “at home” as you are wit
 h yourself in the mirror. Ty’s acoustic and electric guitars and vocal h
 armonies layer self upon self\, forming a spiny backbone for the album. Te
 xtures at once gentle and dissonant root the songs as they make their move
 : melodic arcs convulsing in doubt and bliss and rage. Busting out of the 
 endless gridlock into open space\, these spirits pass on through.\n“Hell
 o\, Hi”’s flickering awakening to this trip: the opening three tracks
 ’ train of sweet and salty reflections\, before the abrupt crunch of the
  title track electrifies the senses. Good morning’s turned to good mourn
 ing in nothing flat\, but there’s still a way up from the doldrums\, to 
 try again. Why can’t it be just as simple as “Hello\, Hi”? What to d
 o with yourself when love triggers loathing? How many more times do you ha
 ve to go back there again? Pulling at the scratchy wool threads of an old 
 sweater favored for warmth\, comfort\, protection\, rejection\, denial\, b
 lindness etc\, Ty Segall dives from a clear\, open sky\, down through the 
 marine layer and the shimmering waves of all the years.\nRadiating from th
 e same mind fields as Goodbye Bread and Sleeper\, mixed with shard edges o
 f contrast and contradiction from things like Freedom’s Goblin\, Manipul
 ator\, and First Taste\, “Hello\, Hi” is Ty’s most relaxed and compl
 ete production to date\, an ebb-and flow fusion of words and music offerin
 g abstraction and acceptance as it wrestles itself through a fucked-up tim
 e. Your life and what you make of it — throughout “Hello\, Hi\,”
  Ty Segall charts a passage through its enduring tangles honestly\, with c
 larity and confusion. \nCHARLES MOOTHART“Losing Ground is the mutated b
 ridge that connects Soft Crime and Blood Machine. It is the piece that f
 astens the three songs together and outlines them as new visions. Original
 ly\, I thought of the riff for Losing Ground as a bridge in the song struc
 ture sense\, but when I took a step back I realized it had the potential t
 o be a structure of its own. It is one of the more vulnerable tracks I hav
 e made with the vocals pretty far out front. I wanted it to feel hopefully
  battered. Looking up from the floor with feelings of intention and unders
 tanding.”\n\n

 tively. Generally speaking their modus operandi has been to produce a viol
 ently spatially and temporally disrupted form of pop music which sometimes
  sees them gleefully break apart existing styles only to expertly reassemb
 le them and other times sees them mint entirely fresh genres. Both of them
  grew up playing and loving classical music and picked up a bug for jazz i

 evi\, with Taylor having a penchant for Bob Dylan\, and Georgia for Joni M
 itchell. They have released a clutch of singles\, EPs and a mixtape over t

 : Georgia sings a classic pre-rock & roll orchestral lounge pop song while
  Taylor forces it through a post-dubstep blender\, mixing old with new.\nB

 e been 3 years in the making. Everything on it is pretty singular sounding
  so we hope there is a track on there for everyone and something that spea

 kstrap are the only young artists in the UK (both are 24) who currently ha

 PM – Show\nAOIFFE NESSA FRANCES\nIn spring of 2020\, Aoife Nessa Frances
  moved out of the city for the first time in her life. After packing up he
 r things in Dublin\, she moved to rural County Clare on the west coast of 
 Ireland\, and there\, amidst the stillness\, she worked on the songs that 
 would become her second album\, Protector. The resulting body of work deft
 ly juxtaposes golden hours and arguments\, affection and alienation\, and 
 above all marks a crucial period of her life that was transformative and l
 eft her wiser.\n \n“I might have been running away from my problems\,”
  she admits. “I was disconnected from myself and from nature\, but I fou
 nd peace far away from the city\, where there were no distractions. I isol
 ated myself with nothing to do but make music.” Writing Protector provid
 ed Frances an essential sounding board for this journey. “I felt a growi
 ng inner strength that guided me through the making of this album. It was 
 like sculpting with my eyes closed\, this intense sense of self-preservati
 on leading me and growing with each song I wrote. When I started\, I didn
 ’t recognise myself. With each song\, I became more human.”\n \nAoife 
 spent that summer with her dad and two sisters. “It was a very special t
 ime for my family as we had never been that tight knit before\,” she say
 s\, “and we all became very close…driving the country roads and swimmi
 ng in the Atlantic Ocean and lakes of Clare. I had one CD in my car: Jim S
 ullivan’s UFO and we listened to it over and over again.” Like many pe
 ople in their late twenties shaking off youthful rebelliousness\, Frances 
 experienced a solidification of familial ties like never before\, and felt
  the formation of a protective\, impenetrable shell. “For me\, Protector
  acknowledges the part of myself that steers me towards a brighter path. T
 he almost psychotropic power of nature gave me a connection I never felt b
 efore. As the countryside seeped into me and lines of communication opened
  up with my family\, I developed an ability to perceive myself and my choi
 ces within an expanded world.”\nINDIGO SPARKE\n \n“To be at the edge\,
  at the precipice of anything\, requires deep surrender. It’s like dying
  over and over again. In the tidal throes of life at its fullest and most 
 intense is the space where grace and strength is fortified and cultivated\
 , is what I am learning” Indigo Sparke ruminates on her magnetic second 
 full-length album Hysteria\, a huge and beautiful sweeping work\, one that
  possesses a rare\, reflective power. From the first few notes\, in the fi
 rst song\, Blue\, something chilling and captivating pierces straight into
  the listener’s chest. With harmonies reminiscent of the voices in our h
 eads\, she examines love\, loss\, grief\, a newly realized rage\, her hist
 ory\, dreams\, and the emotional weather patterns surrounding those sensat
 ions: her words tell the stories\, and the sounds act them out. It’s a d
 iary built for big stages. ‘Hysteria’ arrives just a year after her st
 riking\, minimalist debut\, Echo. Here though\, Sparke offers an expansive
  body of work—it’s a simultaneously nostalgic yet clear and complex co
 llection that expands her sound and outlook. \n

 olland their music has been constantly changing\, always challenging and o
 ften quite breathtaking. Some of us have always been of the opinion that X
 YMOX are something special. A band fired by electronic music but determine
 d\, always\, to make something that is very much their own. They are uniqu
 e. Clan of Xymox\, during the years released many hit and cult albums sinc

 ). While the studio recordings are made by William and Sarah alone\, the l
