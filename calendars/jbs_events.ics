DESCRIPTION:\n*All events are 21+ valid ID required for entry*\n8 PM – D
 oors9 PM – Show\nSUN JUNE\nThe first two minutes of Sun June’s third a
 lbum\, Bad Dream Jaguar\, is a reverie – Laura Colwell’s voice floats 
 above a slow-burn\, sparse synth\, conjuring a tipsy loneliness\, a hazy r
 ecollection\, a disco ball spinning at the end of the night for an empty d
 ance floor. Sun June’s music often feels like a shared memory – the de
 tails so close to the edge of a song that you can touch them. And as an Au
 stin-based project\, their music has also always felt strangely and specif
 ically Texan – unhurried\, long drives across an impossible expanse of o
 penness\, refractions shimmering off the pavement in the heat.But on Bad D
 ream Jaguar\, Sun June is unmoored. The backdrop of Texas is replaced by l
 onging\, by distance\, by transience\, and a quiet fear. The only sense of
  certainty comes from the murky past. It’s a dispatch from aging\, when 
 you’re in the strange in-between of yourself: there’s a clear image of
  the person you once were and the places you inhabited\, generational curs
 es and our families\, but the future feels vast\, unclear – and the pres
 ent can’t help but slip through your fingers.\nDAN WRIGGINS\nDan Wriggin
 s is a Philadelphia-based songwriter\, musician\, and poet. He grew up in 
 the town of Yarmouth\, Maine\, and on Islesford\, a small island community
  near Bar Harbor. In high school\, he started playing piano and guitar\, a

 ing boats before moving to Philadelphia and starting the alt-country band 
 Friendship in 2015\, now signed to Merge Records\, with whom he has toured

 DOORS\n9PM SHOW\n \nDIRTY DOLLHOUSE \n\nDirty Dollhouse is the multi-gen
 re music of Philadelphia-based artist Chelsea Mitchell\, a folk chanteuse 
 with classical training and a retro-pop composer with a soft spot for cou
 ntry. After releasing her first lo-fi EP\, Married in the Aviary\, Mitchel
 l received the Tri-State Indie Vocalist of the Year award and the lyrics t
 o her song “Nobody’s Daughter” were showcased in American Songwriter
  Magazine. Joined by light accompaniment for a follow-up EP\, 25 Shades\, 
 saw a departure from traditional folk and embraced a Nashville vibe while 
 2017’s full-length album Vinyl Child was a mixture of darkly contemplati
 ve pop songs and quiet\, intimate confession. Drawing from many muses has
  produced a uniquely diverse catalogue\, but it has also made it near-impo
 ssible to pin down who Mitchell sounds like. In sultry-toned moments you m
 ight hear Nicole Atkins\, a soft bird-like peak could make you think of Ka
 cey Musgraves\, and a certain belt may summon Brandi Carlile. Though her v
 ocals range from soft twang to unabashedly operatic\, it could suffice to 
 say that Mitchell’s songs all fit under the same “singer-songwriter”
  umbrella as her lyrics weave a diary page to life and her band expands on
  structural simplicity with subtle grace. As bassist Joshua Machiz\, drumm
 er Eric Lawry\, and lead guitarist August John Lutz II are now full-time m
 embers\, Dirty Dollhouse has found a new and exciting momentum\, opening f
 or rising stars like Nikki Lane and Amanda Shires and playing to a wider a
 udience.\n \nBREN\nBren is a Philadelphia\, PA based singer/songwriter wr
 iting cathartic pop tunes from a punk heart. Having moved over 10 times in
  her life\, dropped out of college\, ended and started new relationships\,
  Bren knows a thing or two about unexpected change. Breaking through self-
 doubt is a common theme throughout her writing. Distilling influences rang
 ing from Elliott Smith to Mitski to the Pixies\, Bren’s music shares fam
 iliar sentiments of vulnerability and introspection\, serving as your comp
 anion for feelings you may not have even realized you had.\n \nDOMINY\n\n
 Dominy is band featuring the songs of guitarist John Dominy. The band debu
 ted their first album ‘Wet leather’ in 2018\, and has since put out 2 
 additional full length albums. Besides music\, the members of Dominy\, rea
 l estate speculation\, long walks on the beach\, and taking group crafting

 lyrical storytelling. Their music has received praise and radio play from 
 NPR\, Little Steven’s Underground Garage\, and 88.5 WXPN\, where they pl
 ayed the XPoNential Music Festival. They have shared the stage with nation
 al acts (Gin Blossoms\, Jenny Lewis\, Drive-By Truckers\, Old 97’s) and

  Coordinators are Robert Pino and Tim W. Smith\, lifelong best friends liv
 ing and recording from home in South Philly. On their new EP “Yeah\, Wel

 eking self-improvement\, we parse through our inner angels and demons\, de
 signating our better tendencies as core parts of our identity and dismissi

 — as if both sides aren’t integral parts of us. Personal growth can be
  a tricky and disingenuous prospect — often further muddied by capitalis
 m\, armchair psychologists and religious zealots — but it’s also an es
 sential\, life-affirming process worth enduring. Box for Buddy\, Box for S
 tar\, the latest album from This Is Lorelei\, explores this conundrum\, fu
 nctioning both as an earnest transformative exercise and a tongue-in-cheek
  takedown of the illusion of transformation.Since 2012\, New York City sin
 ger-songwriter Nate Amos (Water From Your Eyes\, My Idea) has recorded and
  self-released hundreds of songs under the This Is Lorelei moniker\, and p
 erhaps surprisingly\, after a decade plus\, Box for Buddy\, Box for Star m
 arks the first attempt at a traditional\, intentionally written full-lengt
 h album. Amos describes the bulk of This Is Lorelei’s discography as “
 unedited diary entries\,” written and recorded without much forethought\
 , regard for genre or reverence for albums as thematic bodies of work\, so
  oddly enough\, Box for Buddy\, Box for Star is both a fresh start and the
  culmination of years of diligent\, interesting songwriting.\nYOUBET\n \n

 sound? It depends on when you ask.The 24-year-old\, Maryland-raised songwr
 iter arrived on the music scene with 2020’s Classical Notions of Happine
 ss\, an album of lo-fi pop and hushed folk songs recorded in her Maryland 
 & Kansas bedrooms. She’d be back by the end of that same year with Somet
 hing To Say To You\, a compilation of two EPs featuring craggy indie rock 
 and brokenhearted acoustic fare recorded in NYC apartment studios with fri
 ends.By 2022 she was swinging for the fences with the pristine pop of Face
  The Wall\, all while shuttling back and forth between Brooklyn and her so
 on-to-be home of Eagle Rock\, LA collaborating on a wide array of projects
  with a who’s who of Gen Z artists: Magdalena Bay\, TV Girl\, Yot Club\,
  Paul Cherry\, Dent May\, Inner Wave.“I don’t think I’ll ever settle
  on a specific sound\,” says Jordana. “I’m just a chameleon.”So he
 r vibrant fourth LP\, Lively Premonition\, which is equal parts Laurel Can
 yon folk and shimmering yacht rock\, should surprise no one.“Maybe it’
 s my LA record\,” she says of the album she worked on with producer and 
 multi-instrumentalist Emmett Kai for the entirety of 2023. “I can’t pi
 npoint exactly what affected it\, but I do think the sun has its beam on m
 e. Through all of these releases\, it’s so cool to see which eras I’ve
  gone through and what I’ve experimented with\,” says Jordana.Though t
 he concept of eras is exhaustingly omnipresent at the moment\, Jordana has
  earned the right to draw the definitive lines between her releases and mu
 sical phases. Her current iteration owes a debt to a deep love for artists
  like The Mamas & The Papas\, Carole King\, Donald Fagen & Walter Becker 
 – all New Yorkers who\, like Jordana\, moved out west and found their so
 unds flourishing.\nRACHEL BOBBITT\nLife runs in rhythmic loops\, from the 
 endless rotations of the earth to the running of tides and yearly rebirth 
 of spring. Rachel Bobbitt knows that the bottom of those cycles can feel p
 retty chaotic. “Every woman I’ve ever talked to is in some amount of p
 ain almost all the time\,” the Toronto-based singer-songwriter says. “
 That could be physical pain\, emotional pain\, familial pain\, but it’s 
 there in cycles.” On her piercing and profound new EP\, The Ceiling Coul
 d Collapse (due July 15th\, 2022\, via Fantasy Records)\, Bobbitt picks th
 rough the dizzying rubble of folk and indie rock for moments of resonant e
 motion and frames them in heartbreaking lyrics and openhearted expanses.\n

 the close-knit group of Al Menne\, Dylan Hanwright\, Cam LaFlam\, and Pat 
 and Carrie Goodwin – didn’t know if they would go on. After starting o
 n the follow-up to Four of Arrows\, each member was called in different di
 rections\, some to new countries\, new jobs\, new life stages. But as Menn
 e puts it simply\, “Time passed and I missed my friends.” As any good 
 relationship built on mutual love\, trust\, and a mountain of shared histo
 ry\, the quintet—who grew up in Seattle and have been making music toget
 her for a decade—were drawn back into one another’s orbits in 2023.  
 Great Grandpa recently made their highly-anticipated and “epic return”
  (Brooklyn Vegan) with the gorgeous track “Kid\,” and “Doom” is an
 other cathartic entry in the band’s beloved catalog. Penned by Pat Goodw
 in soon after the release of 2019’s acclaimed Four of Arrows\, the song 
 swirled in the band’s consciousness\, taking on many iterations before b
 eing officially recorded in 2024. “Doom\,” produced by guitarist/engin

 rth album from singer\, songwriter and perpetual searcher Esther Rose. It
 ’s the quiet culmination of years spent fully immersed in a developing a
 rtistry\, and presents Rose’s always vividly detailed emotional scenes w
 ith new levels of clarity and control. As with previous work\, her songwri
 ting transfigures the chaos and uncertainty of a life in progress\, but he
 re she sharpens the pop elements and attaches unshakably catchy hooks to e
 ven the darkest stretches of the journey.After spending her formative year
 s in Michigan\, Rose relocated to New Orleans and got her start in music t
 here while awash in the unparalleled energy of the city’s scene. Over th
 e course of her first three records\, an infatuation with traditional coun
 try gradually evolved into a more distinctive style and increasingly perso
 nal material. Rose’s music traced her changes as she moved through stag
 es\, studios\, and home addresses\, and she eventually left NOLA for New M
 exico where the two year writing process for Safe to Run unfolded. Making 
 the transition to this new environment after spending the better part of a
  decade building a life somewhere else demanded looking around and taking 
 stock. All the heaviness\, sweetness\, levity\, and self-discovery that ha
 d led up to that point began funneling into new songs that moved slower in
  order to dig deeper\, taking on the intricate hues of a desert horizon as
  they came together.\nTWAIN\n“There is nothing remarkable about my life 
 that is necessary to know in order to appreciate the songs\,” says Matth
 ew Davidson of Twain. He describes the project as “a modern folk-opera o
 f indefinite length consisting of songs and images from my life\, a self-c
 aricature of the musician and writer Matthew Davidson.”Twain made his la
 bel debut with Rare Feeling in 2017. The album was aptly hailed by NPR as 
 “at once human and otherworldly\,” by Consequence of Sound as “devas
 tating\, delicate\, meditative\,” and by Uproxx as “cosmic folk\, brig
 ht and sparkling\, but with all the caterwauling and rough bits that the m
 ost stoic traditionalist might desire.” Following the beloved release\,
  Twain played Newport Folk Festival and toured alongside artists including
  Buck Meek\, Langhorne Slim\, and Courtney Marie Andrews. Davidson is a fo
 rmer member of The Low Anthem and Spirit Family Reunion and a contributor 
 to Big Thief\, whose latest album Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in Yo

 ey’ve honed and refined their stark\, minimal scrape and clatter for fou
 r years and counting\, having risen out of the ashes of beloved Chicago ba
 nd Disappears in 2018 with the bone-rattling intensity of Negative Houses.
  The trio return in 2021 with Present Tense\, their fourth album and perha
 ps their sharpest statement as a band. Opener “XOUT” barrels forward 
 like a tank\, with Case’s guitar chiming like warning bells\, until the 
 climax comes crashing down\, glitching out near the close. “Strawberry C
 ough” comes next\, its fusion of corporeal playing and stately\, electro
 nic heartbeats punctured by random bursts of noise or backwards masked sou
 nds. “Alone Without”\, a track originally recorded for Adult Swim’s 
 2020 singles series appears next in different form\; more menacing and ser
 pentine. Side two opens with “General Public”\, taking the loud/quiet 
 dynamic as a jumping off point for the song’s unsettling seasick vibe. 
 ‘How To See In the Dark” offers a brief respite\, with its persistent\
 , dark quietude that lingers until the song’s end. “Present Tense”\,
  the album’s title track\, offers up its first truly weird moment mid-so
 ng when the song changes mood distinctly\, and the music drops out save fo
 r Case’s guitar and vocals. The album’s final track\, the densely pack
 ed “Mirrored”\, begins with a restrained\, post-rock shuffle. The mind
 -scrambling cacophony that comes next takes its time to roll in\, but once
  it does\, it comes in waves\, flipping back onto itself multiple times un
 til it’s folded into oblivion. FACS once again shuttered themselves int
 o Electrical Audio with lauded engineer Sanford Parker to lay down the bas
 ic tracks and overdubs for Present Tense. This time\, the band approached 
 their songwriting from a different angle “Alone Without was the first so
 ng we recorded and we really built it in the studio” Case says\, “Alia
 nna and I played different instruments\, and I think that freedom informed
  how the other songs developed. All the lyrics were random phrases on a bi
 g sheet and were put together as the songs took shape\, so I feel like I w
 as collecting these thoughts and trying to figure out how to process them 
 as a big picture vs making complete ideas in individual songs.” Case add
 s ”…letting the songs go where they wanted\, without steering them int
 o what we all think a FACS album should be.” The change is palpable from
  last year’s claustrophobic and fried Void Moments\, but Present Tense i
 s still ALL FACS\, albeit draped in a layer of haze. Paranoia in soft focu
 s\, perhaps?\n

 Seattle trio—vocalist/guitarist Grant Mullen\, bassist/vocalist Gianni A
 iello and drummer Henry LaVallee—were all eighteen years old\, and full 
 of the reckless\, restless energy of youth. A decade on\, both they and th
 e world have changed immensely. Shine Away—the band’s third full-lengt
 h\, following on from 2018’s SLUFF and 2020’s The Shadow—is very muc
 h an acknowledgement of that. It’s an album that doesn’t just reflect 
 on the personal life and times of the three of them and the world at large
 \, but casts a discerning\, self-reflective eye on what it’s like to be 
 in\, and be\, Naked Giants. It’s the sound of a band coming into\, and b
 ecoming\, themselves. Of course\, that’s a never-ending process\, but fo
 r the first time in their career\, Naked Giants are taking stock of their 
 journey—who and what they were\, are\, and want to be.  \n“Our first 
 record was still running on fuel from starting the band as 18 year olds wi
 th a rock’n’roll dream\,” says Mullen. “Since then\, life has chan
 ged. We all got day jobs or went back to school\, and really grew into our
 selves individually.  Before\, we were anxious to express ourselves in wh
 atever way we could through music. Now\, we have more to say\, and I think
  we’ve made a record with more meaning and purpose.”\nDespite these pe
 rsonal changes Shine Away contains the same sense of impetuous urgency tha
 t defined SLUFF. and the band’s preceding 2016 debut EP\, R.I.P.\, and w
 as still to be found within the fabric of The Shadow’s songs\, too. So w

 he “Simigwa Do Man\,” Ambolley’s musical journey began in the vibran
 t port city of Sekondi-Takoradi\, in the Western Region of Ghana. His earl
 y fascination with music blossomed into a lifelong passion. From mastering
  his father’s flute at the tender age of eight\, to honing his guitar sk
 ills under the mentorship of “Uncle Bonku”\, Sammy Lartey and Ebo Tayl
 or\, Ambolley’s musical odyssey has been nothing short of extraordinary.
  This all led to Ambolley becoming a musical life force and exploding on t
 he scene in 1973 with a jazzy highlife sound called ‘SIMIGWA-DO’. His 
 name has become synonymous with Simigwa music and dance.Coming of age amid
 st the zenith of Ghana’s highlife era\, Ambolley emerged as a pivotal fi
 gure in its evolution\, lending his talents to esteemed bands such as Houg
 has Extraordinaires\, Meridians Of Tema and Ghana Broadcasting Band. It wa
 s during this time that he caught the attention of his compatriot and frie
 nd\, Ebo Taylor\, who recruited Ambolley to be a member of the Uhuru Dance
  Band. This all lead to a transformative journey to Nigeria in 1973\, wher
