  \nTHE KNEE-JERK REACTIONIn 2017\, Gabriel DeSanto first began writing mus
 ic under the moniker The Knee-Jerk Reaction\, interested in exploring what
  lies beneath the gaudy and vapid corners of American life. After recordin
 g through long nights that summer in Kentucky\, the music began resembling
  a score from an abandoned romantic drama from the 80s\, full of unrequite
 d love and desperation.  Now a full band\, backed by Francie Medosch\, El
 i Kleinsmith\, Adam Torneo\, Garrett Burke\, and Jared Radichel\, the musi
 c remains flamboyant and grounded in rock n roll tradition\, taking you to
  the depths of murky dive bars off the side of the highway to motels where
  secret lovers elope. The Knee-Jerk Reaction wants to show you that love w
 ill never die.\n2ND GRADE\n

  Doors8PM – Show\n \nSPEEDY ORTIZ“Rabbit rabbit” is a superstitious 
 incantation repeated on the first of each month to bring good fortune—a 
 belief practiced by Sadie Dupuis\, the guitarist\, singer and songwriter o
 f the Philadelphia rock quartet Speedy Ortiz. As a child with OCD\, she fo
 llowed arbitrary rituals\, a coping mechanism commonly triggered by early 
 trauma\, and “rabbit rabbit” was one that stuck. When Dupuis began to 
 parse difficult memories for the first time in her songwriting\, it felt l
 ike kismet to name her band’s resultant fourth record after an expressio
 n of luck and repetition: Rabbit Rabbit. Instead of re-treading old routin
 es\, the record finds Speedy Ortiz interrogating conventions\, grappling w
 ith cycles of violence and destructive power dynamics with singular wit an
 d riffs. Rabbit Rabbit finds Speedy Ortiz at its most potent: melodically 
 fierce\, sonically mountainous\, scorching the earth and beginning anew. 
 Speedy Ortiz debuted as Dupuis’ home-recording outlet in 2011\, but the 
 solo project quickly blew up into a full-fledged band beloved around the w
 orld for its pointed lyrics\, disarmingly hooky choruses\, and musical ing
 enuity—as well as its activism. The group graced festival stages from Bo
 nnaroo to Primavera\, supported heroic artists from Foo Fighters to Liz Ph
 air\, and brought acts including Mitski and Soccer Mommy on some of their 
 earliest tours. In 2016\, the band relocated from Massachusetts to Philade
 lphia\, with the lineup changing shortly thereafter to include sonically i
 nventive guitarist Andy Molholt (Laser Background\, Eric Slick)\, drivingl
 y melodic bassist Audrey Zee Whitesides (Mal Blum\, Little Waist)\, and he
 avy-hitting drummer Joey Doubek (Pinkwash\, Downtown Boys). Rabbit Rabbit 
 is the first Speedy album to feature the longtime touring members as full 
 contributors\, and Dupuis and her bandmates blaze with unpredictability\, 
 their intrepid playing thrusting songs in exhilarating new directions.\n \
 n \n \nWASHERWasher is a rock band originally from Brooklyn\, NY featuring
  Mike Quigley on guitar/bass/vocals and Kieran McShane on drums. Since for
 ming in the late months of 2013\, the duo have become a staple of the loca
 l DIY scene\, another hard working band playing countless shows throughout
  the eastern and central US. They’ve garnered a strong reputation in tha
 t time thanks to the band’s scrappy energy and infectious indie leaning 
 garage punk anthems. Impossibly catchy and deceptively complex\, Washer’
 s songwriting stays with you\, burrowing deep into the recesses of your mi
 nd as the band aim to “do a lot with a little”. Punk rock minimalism a
 t its finest.\n\n\n\n\n

 ist Dewey Mahood (aka Plankton Wat) and drummer Dustin Dybvig. Garden Part
 y is a celebration of summer and all it brings: communal gatherings\, the 
 respites offered by nature\, and an appreciation for even the simplest bea
 uty\, from 12-foot sunflowers to a contorted carrot planted in the spring.
  Freedom\, contentment\, and joy were the sources for the songs. From the 
 soaring guitar solos\, to the driving rhythms\, the elegant pedal steel li
 nes to the organ grooves\, Garden Party has a live band’s energy capture
 d in exquisite detail.\n \nROSALIPhiladelphia-based artist Rosali makes so
 ngs that take their time in revealing their full power. What might first a
 ppear to be restrained\, introspective compositions will stretch slowly ou
 tward\, snagging your attention with a subtly sideways guitar lead or an e
 xceptionally raw lyric you didn’t catch the first time around. A child o
 f two musicians\, Rosali grew up as part of a large family that sang toget
 her and taught themselves various instruments\, finding the earliest forms
  of her musical voice harmonizing and making up songs with her sisters. As
  an adult\, Rosali merged this musical upbringing with an active involveme
 nt in Philly’s experimental and D.I.Y. community. Her 2016 solo debut Ou
 t of Love was released on Siltbreeze\, a long-running label that champions
  abstract noise and challenging listening. While Rosali’s earliest work 
 was far nearer to folk-informed rock than harsh sonics\, it held an intens
 ity of its own in its strange angles and unexpected vulnerability. Second 
 album Trouble Anyway expanded on the debut with clearer production and mor
 e involved arrangements. A host of friends from Philly’s freak scene con
 tributed to the album\, including appearances from ambient harpist/pianist
  Mary Lattimore\, Purling Hiss/Birds of Maya shredder Mike Polizze\, glist
 ening lap-steel from Mike Sobel\, understated percussion from War On Drugs
  drummer Charlie Hall\, and several others. Trouble Anyway brought Rosali 
 a new level of exposure\, with a flood of positive critical press and tour
 s supporting acts like The Weather Station and J Mascis.\n

 7PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nPROTEX\n \nFormed in 1978\, Prot
 ex were early pioneers of the Belfast Punk Movement. Signed to the now leg
 endary Good Vibrations label\, their debut release Don’t Ring Me Up rece
 ived excellent reviews and enjoyed widespread airplay on Radio 1. They qui
 ckly came to the attention of Rough Trade Records\, who re-released the tr
 ack to wide acclaim. This in turn led to the band signing for Polydor Reco
 rds\, who released the single I Can’t Cope\, followed by I Can Only Drea
 m.\n \n1979 saw the band take to the road with the Boomtown Rats before em
 barking on two extensive tours of their own throughout the US and Canada i
 n the early ‘80s. An album was recorded with legendary producer Chas Cha
 ndler\, who’d worked with\, among others\, Hendrix\, The Animals and Sla
 de. However\, the band weren’t happy with the result and after a final r
 elease\, A Place in Your Heart\, the band and label parted ways\, Protex s
 plitting soon after.\n \nFast Forward to 2010\, when New York’s Sing Sin
 g Records located the Polydor recordings and released the album Strange Ob
 sessions on vinyl\, igniting renewed interest in the band.\n \nFounders Ai
 dan Murtagh and Dave McMaster reformed the band and shows followed across 
 Europe before the band were invited to tour Japan. Protex continued to tou
 r intensively and in 2014 were invited to play the prestigious South by So
 uthwest festival in Austin\, Texas. They returned the following year and h
 ave become regulars at the festival\, often playing there as part of large
 r US tours. In 2016 Protex concentrated on completing the album Tightrope 
 and signed to Bachelor Records. Tightrope was released in early 2017\, bef
 ore the band returned to the USA with a tour that began with a sold-out Ne
 w York show and finished with a festival appearance in San Antonio.\n \nWi
 th touring on hold during the pandemic\, the band concentrated on recordin
 g a new album Wicked Ways\, released on Bachelor Records in August this ye
 ar. And with tours already coming together for Europe and the US\, 2023 is
  already looking like another busy year for Protex.\n

 ors8PM – Show\nCHRIS PUREKAIt’s rare for an artist to bridge the divid
 e between critical acclaim and dedicated fan engagement. Chris Pureka is a
  Portland-based singer-songwriter whose body of work has resonated deeply 
 with these seemingly disparate milieus. Her music has straddled the folk\,
  americana and indie rock genres over the course of her 20 year career\, a
 nd over that time\, her bold vulnerability in processing the intimacies of
  life in song has struck a chord with those listeners who crave authentici
 ty and depth.\n \nChris’s elegant emotionality as a vocalist and her fla
 ir as a lyricist have garnered her favorable comparisons to Chan Marshall\
 , Bruce Springsteen\, and Patty Griffin. Over many years of touring on bot
 h sides of the Atlantic\, she has shared the stage with such diverse and e
 steemed artists as The Lumineers\, Gregory Alan Isakov\, The Cowboy Junkie
 s\, Haley Heynderickx\, and Ani DiFranco. She has had her songs featured o
 n such television shows as Brothers and Sisters\, Covert Affairs and Shame
 less and well as a song featured in the Sundance featured indie film\, The
  Royal Road. Along the way\, Chris has remained truly independent\, sellin
 g nearly 50\,000 albums through her own label\, Sad Rabbit Records.\nKYM R
 EGISTER (OF MELTDOWN RODEO)Sometimes the process of mining for melody in w
 ords eviscerates the raconteur\, gutting them like a tornado through a tra
 iler park. Sometimes\, “the truth” is a revival of shit rather forgott
 en\, igniting a coward’s desire to look away. With “Meltdown Rodeo\,
 ” Kym Register foregoes such consolatory diversions for visceral scrutin
 y and unbroken stares. The result is a body of tunes that forages the Amer
 ican south\, dislodging its ducked bullets from pearly white sand. \nAccor
 ding to Register\, “Scottsboro\,” the album’s opener\, was years in 
 the making. It recounts the little known history of “The Scottsboro Boys
 \,” nine Black men falsely accused of raping a pair of white women in hy
 perpyrexic 1930’s Alabama. One accuser eventually admitted the allegatio
 ns were bullshit\, but\, for Black men in the Jim Crow south (as it is now
 )\, any assumptions of guilt are soon proven a permanent brand. Register w
 ails against America’s foremost refrains –jury and peers and whole tru
 ths– in lyrics hefty with reconciliation and metaphor. “A blind eye\, 
 A blind eye is all justice knows/ Of the truth of what happened in Scottsb
 oro/ Come on now\, this story’s not that old.” Contrary to Register’
 s demand for account\, the American south knows no shame. \nWhether grappl
 ing with the constrictions of gender expressions on dating apps (“How Do
  You See Me”)\, evoking the semi-autobiographical loneliness of Dorothy 
 Allison’s Carolina bastards (“Maureen”)\, or daring white folks to 
 “get right with their history of compliance in racial capitalism” (“
 Loamlands”)\, Register affirms that songwriting\, at its best\, is a gro
 ss but necessary confrontation. Ultimately Register and Meltdown Rodeo (bo
 th the newly named band and album) have achieved in eleven songs something
  the south has only half-heartedly attempted – undoing generational curs
 es by retiring “bless your heart” lip service. \nDamn if we can’t al
 l benefit from a little melting down.\n

 ormed in November 2007\, TRUE WIDOW released their self-titled debut a yea

 the music of TRUE WIDOW is powered by the driving\, guitar-dense aspects o

 t music.Following their auspicious start\, the band returned in 2011 with

 it wasn’t until 2013’s Circumambulation (TRUE WIDOW’s debut album fo
 r independent label Relapse Records) that they reached the heights – bot

 arnered the band widespread praise both within and beyond the metal world 
 and was praised by publications as diverse as Pitchfork\, NPR\, Decibel Ma
 gazine\, and Metal Injection. The band followed up the success of that alb
 um with extensive touring across the US\, Russia\, and Europe\, including 
 numerous appearances at renowned festivals such as Roadburn\, Fun Fun Fun 
 Fest\, Psycho California\, and more.This year\, Avvolgere\, the forthcomin

 on established. The album rocks and rolls with serene\, rounded climaxes a

 ure alternation between male and female vocals helps further blur the boun

 Why Dolphins Lost Their Legs–is the Sunday Morning comedown. “[Isloma

 \, that there is no future\, that all hope is lost. I wanted to explore th

 on of songs represents a big leap forward. With addictive hooks at every p
 ossible turn\, Dolphins (the 9th record in the catalogue)\, stands out as 
 quite likely the strongest and most articulate Islands album yet. Nick Tho
 rburn and band manage to slyly tap into both the pain and the joy of livin
 g\, often simultaneously\, while stripping the music down to its simplest 
 element: a strange sample rubbing up against a bouncing bassline\, a snapp

  Doors8PM – Show\n \nHAND HABITSThere is a moment halfway through Hand H
 abits’ Fun House at which musician Meg Duffy asks the question\, “How 
 many times must I rewind the tape?” It’s a fitting question planted sq
 uarely in the middle of a sonically adventurous record concerned largely w
 ith making sense and taking stock. How much time must we spend examining o
 ur own past in order to fully understand it? How can we safely acknowledge
  pain in order to release it and fully actualize who we are supposed to be
 ? Buffeted by strings\, synths\, and a gently-shook tambourine\, the aptly
 -titled track\, “The Answer\,” highlights the emotional engine at the 
 heart of the record. “I know t… Duffy sings\, “Here’s what I hope 
 to find – it’s always mine.”Fun House is Duffy’s most ambitious Ha
 nd Habits album to date. Produced by Sasami Ashworth (SASAMI) and engineer
 ed by Kyle Thomas (King Tuff)\, the record was not intended as a reaction 
 to the pandemic\, but it was very much the result of taking a difficult\, 
 if much-needed\, moment of pause. “When the pandemic happened\, everythi
 ng stopped\,” recalls Duffy. “I had been touring consistently for five
  years\, both on my own and playing in other people’s bands\, so I wasn
 ’t really writing a lot in between. It had been full pedal to the metal 
 in terms of traveling and scheduling\, which meant I really didn’t have 
 a lot of time to think about how I felt or really check in with myself. Th
 en\, when the world basically stopped\, it turned out to be the longest I
 ’ve been alone in my entire life – without being in a relationship\, w
 ithout being on the road\, without working myself to exhaustion – and th
 e result was really like\, holy shit. I slammed on the brakes and everythi
 ng psychologically that I’d been pushing down and ignoring for the past 
 few years suddenly flew to the foreground.”What started out as a very pe
 rsonal reckoning eventually blossomed into a fruitful and convenient means
  of making new music. Grounded in LA and sharing a house with Ashworth and
  Thomas\, who also runs a studio space in the building\, Duffy began to fl
 esh out the songs that would eventually become Fun House. Emboldened by go
 ing into therapy and coaxed by Ashworth to push the songs into unexpected 
 new shapes\, the resulting music was more acutely personal and stylistical
 ly adventurous than anything they had attempted before. The new songs also
  became a prism through which Duffy could begin to self-actualize in a new
  way.\nALLEGRA KRIEGER“I Keep My Feet on the Fragile Plane” – Allegr
 a Krieger’s fourth record and her first with Double Double Whammy – is
  her most mature and alluring work yet. It contains all the signatures of 
 her best lyricism: delicate and precise phrasings\, moments that flicker b
 etween beauty and banality\, meaning that forms through the accretion of o
 bservations\, memories\, and unexpected adages. This is an album that is a
 t once post-theistic and devoted to a relationship with the divine\, each 
 song blinking in and out of “the fragile plane\,” a place Krieger desc
 ribes as “a middle ground in the universe\,” both abstract and peacefu
 l\, where time\, bodies\, and names don’t exist. \n

 recording Careful!\, their third record and Sub Pop debut. “I wanted the

 RGodcaster is a lambent pumping heart. Hysterically keen like birds. The s

 ildhood friends [Judson] Kolk and Ebersole\, the band traversed a variety 
 of monikers\, sounds and members over the years until 2018 when the band r
 e-founded with the arrival of Mcfaul\, [Von] Kolk and Pickard. Fontana\, w
 ho had worked closely with the band in the past\, joined a couple years la

 CER Grocer is a band from Philadelphia. Lead by three distinct vocalists\,
  they pendulate between moments of brash atonality\, saccharine pop sensib
 ility\, and rhythmic acrobatics. Their compositions are both meticulous an
 d volatile\, while their live performances are lauded for explosive chemis
 try with cheeky curiosity. On their most recent full length Number’s Gam
 e the band rearranged the puzzle pieces of 90s-influenced rock and dissona
 nt pop into something utterly their own. Now building on a landscape of po
 lyrhythms and chromaticism that their fans have grown to cherish\, they ex
 plore new sonic structures in their forthcoming EP Scatter Plot. Across it
 s six tracks\, Grocer reiterates they are just as comfortable with glassy 
 earworms as they are with angular dissonance. They remain giddy\, furious 
 and singularly themselves.\n

 inges for over four decades. Flashes of reggae\, bursts of noise\, guitars
  that rattle\, shake and snake\, born out of a gutter behind CBGBs. The ba
 nd’s first iteration lasted just a few years\, from 1979 through the ear
 ly ‘80s. But they respawned time and time again\, contorting their sound
 \, tweaking the vision\, remaining completely singular and indispensable a
 long the way. In the late 2010s the group—Pat Place\, Cynthia Sley\, and
  Dee Pop—reformed again\, releasing an EP\, Take the Fall\, in 2018. It 
 was their first offering of new music in over a decade. A few years later 
 in\, 2021\, they released a career spanning box set called Rhythm and Para
 noia. The New York Times called the box set an artifact that “proves for
  decades [that the Bush Tetras] continued to evolve in surprising yet intu
 itive directions.” And in Pitchfork’s Best New Reissue\, Rhythm and Pa
 ranoia revealed “just how vital [the Bush Tetras] remained each decade.
 ” LIVE SKULL“Getting in a room and being really noisy is just a natur

 k noisers who went on indefinite hiatus just before their kind of smart\, 
 gnarly\, inventive din became lucrative\, they rose again in 2016\, their 
 new album Party Zero a thrilling work redefining what Live Skull means and
  what they stand for – no longer a group with a past\, but one with a fu

 ating bands to emerge in recent years\, CIVIC have reimagined the reckless
  intensity of proto-punk for an era of endless uncertainty. On their 2021 
 debut album Future Forecast\, the Melbourne-based five-piece offered up a 
 barrage of songs matching their frenetic sound with both self-aware outpou
 ring and incisive observation of the world around them—a dynamic that’
 s earned massive critical acclaim as well as admiration from the likes of 
 punk legend Henry Rollins. As further shown on their upcoming sophomore fu
 ll-length Taken By Force—an album the band aptly sums up as “1984 meet
 s Endless Summer”—CIVIC joyfully obliterate the line between furious c
 atharsis and unbridled fun\, introducing a vital new energy into today’s
  musical landscape.  Hailed by Stereogum as “an unholy lo-fi pile-up of
  garage rock\, punk\, and ’90s-style noise-rock\,” CIVIC inject every 
 song with a visceral urgency hinting at their shared history in the local 
 hardcore scene. As frontman Jim McCullough recalls\, the band first took s
 hape back in 2017\, when he and a friend dreamed up a musical project insp
 ired by iconic Australian punk acts like Radio Birdman and The Saints. “
 We were in a bowling alley in Japan and came up with a very strong focus f
 or what the band could do\, which was take that three-chord ’70s punk so
 und but get a little more thoughtful with the melodies and songwriting\,
 ” says McCullough. Upon returning from Japan\, McCullough soon recruited
  a full lineup featuring Lewis Hodgson and bassist Roland Hlavka. Within s

  2018 release that prompted Vice to crown the band “Melbourne’s New Ki

 elphia in early 2023 when the latest bit of bad news arrived: His grandfat
 her\, a native of that very city\, was dead. It wasn’t entirely unexpect
 ed. For years\, Tommy Burt had struggled with early-onset dementia\, slipp
 ing away a bit more each time Burt saw him. Burt even began recording his 
 grandfather\, letting his tape recorder roll as they had some of their fin
 al conversations. He wanted to preserve those moments\, however repetitiou
 s or fragmented they might be\, before the opportunity vanished forever. I
 n fact\, Traffic Fiction—Burt’s third album on Oh Boy Records and an u
 nexpected musical reinvention rooted in his new and idiosyncratic version 
 of classic soul—also preserves their relationship by committing another 
 key piece of it to tape. The soul that animates so many of these 14 tracks
 ? That was the music shared by grandfather and grandson.Burt’s Californi
 a childhood was not easy. His parents split when he was young\, so he woul
 d often shuttle between their houses in Sacramento and the Bay Area. He wa
 s a bit of a wild child\, too. From time to time\, though\, he would accom
 pany his father to work at a plant nursery\, riding shotgun in a 1975 Cadi
 llac Seville as they listened to The Delfonics and Otis Redding\, Marvin G
 aye and The Temptations. Those drives were his sanctuary\, that music thei
 r blessed score. But as Burt became a musician himself\, he was a peripat
 etic troubadour\, tapping into American folk and blues partly as a matter 
 of necessity—it’s not sensible to busk\, after all\, with some sophist
 icated band at your back. Bits of those other roots and compositional ambi
 tions finally emerged on 2021’s You\, Yeah\, You\, the vivid result of B
 urt’s first proper studio sessions. On Traffic Fiction\, they are in ful
 l bloom\, from the sweet country-soul surrealism of the title track to the
  skywriting rock of “2 For Tha Show\,” Burt as urgent and commanding a
 s he’s ever been. Traffic Fiction is the sound of Burt confidently bendi
 ng a sentimental past to his present will.\nSKYWAY MANOn his third voyage 
 as Skyway Man\, artist + producer James Wallace is still seeking answers b
 eyond the stars and still coming back with more questions in the form of t
 en brilliant songs. On its surface\, Flight of the Long Distance Healer re
 gisters as another concept album replete with aliens and alternative philo
 sophy\, but this time around\, Wallace coats the glass with a vital layer 
 of self-reflection.Like a West Coast Dr. John—but more preoccupied with 
 flying saucers than voodoo dolls—Skyway Man is in the business of openin
 g new aural worlds\, cracking open reality just enough to get the message 
 through. Flight of the Long Distance Healer sparkles and blinks\, whispers
  and moans—hugely enjoyable music rendered in imaginative and gleaming s
 tyle. There are hints of the polyrhythmic cinematic sensibility from Walla
 ce’s contributions to the Joe Pera television series\, rhythms of the St
 ax-inspired Spacebomb house band\, and ripples of the current East Bay sce
 ne outside San Francisco. In a real showcase for the extended Skyway Man f
 amily\, Wallace has coaxed personal and masterful performances from the li
 kes of Erin Rae\, Vetiver’s Andy Cabic\, Molly Sarlé\, pedal steel wiza
 rd Spencer Cullum\, Kelly McFarling\, and more. Cooking up genres in such 
 a way as to keep their nutrients intact\, he packs prog\, blues\, glam roc

 that tie people together forever\, whether it be a place\, a song or somet
 hing you can’t quite define through words. The origins of Orions Belte s
 temmed from one of those mystical moments in time\, which spawned a lastin
 g creative connection. Øyvind Blomstrøm (guitar) and Chris Holm (bass) f
 irst met while playing in a touring band for another Norwegian artist. Dur
 ing that time\, they bonded over the ir love for instrumental music and be
 gan talking about trying their hand at it themselves. After their work as 
 touring band ended\, they recruited drummer Kim Åge Furuhaug\, one of Hol
 m’s longtime friend and collaborators\, to join their new project.\n \nT
 he three met in Bergen\, located along the west coast of Norway\, to start
  working on ideas and demos. Instead\, within just a few days\, they ended
  up recording their entire first album – Mint. From there\, the universe
  propelled them forward\, resulting in a recor d deal\, their live debut a
 s a band at Norway’s biggest pop festival Øyafestivalen and the release
  of their debut record all happening within the following year. Mint drew 
 international interest and praise from outlets including Atwood Magazine\,
  who called the record “an eclectic fusion of disparate styles and excit
 ing sounds that says what it wants to say through memorable melodies\, amb
 ient drones\, and a stockpile of wicked guitar riffs.”\n \nAfter their d
 ebut record\, Orions Belte never slowed down. They had found their path\,

 or the recording of their third album\, Death Bells have returned Between 
 Here & Everywhere\, an effort that captures the cross-section of Southern 
 California’s shadowy hidden interzones\, outside of the lights and luxur
 y.\n \nThe record features nine new songs that represent Will Canning and 
 Remy Veselis’ continual growth\, as well as accompaniment by an experien
 ced cast of contributors on keys\, strings\, piano\, and operatic backup v
 ocals. Recorded with Colin Knight at Paradise Studios\, and mixed by Mike 
 Kriebel at Golden Beat\, Between Here & Everywhere bristles with immediacy
  and emotion\, with every element tactile\, balanced\, and elevated.\n \nB
 LACKWATER HOLYLIGHT\n \nEmpty surrounds all of me . It’s a poignant line
  from the third album by Blackwater Holylight that encapsulates the search
  for self when suddenly everything has changed. There’s a theme of proce
 ssing vast personal trauma throughout Silence/Motion that eloquently — b
 oth lyrically and musically — and simultaneously embodies the crushing e
 mptiness\, sorrow\, strength and rebuilding of recovering from personal de
 vastation. \n \n“There was so much grief both in the world and interper
 sonally during the process of creating Silence/Motion \,” says vocalist/
 bassist Allison “Sunny” Faris. “The four of us gave one another more
  space to be ourselves\, to experiment with each other’s ideas and to be
  gentle with one another more than we ever have before. So\, we knew this 
 tenderness would manifest in extremely honest arrangements\, and I think t
 hat you can hear that throughout the record.” \n \nCuriously\, consider
 ing the dark times in which it was created\, this is the band’s most mel
 odic and catchy music so far. Blackwater Holylight\, as the name suggests\
 , is all about contrasts: It’s a fluid convergence of sound that’s hea
 vy\, psychedelic\, melodic\, terrifying and beautiful all at once. And\, S
 ilence/Motion finds the band honing those contrasts\, letting ideas and mo
 ods fully develop from song to song\, rather than filling every song with 
 a full range of their capabilities. It allows the band to go fully prog-ro
 ck here\, and simply stay hushed and intimate there. There’s a new confi
 dence to the band in how seamlessly they wield their stylistic amalgam.\n

 ke a kid: experimenting\, having fun\, and trying to discover new things a
 bout this work\,” says Pile’s Rick Maguire about All Fiction. It’s h
 is band’s eighth record\, and one that finds the ambitious group assembl
 ing its most texturally complex material yet—despite the fraught inspira
 tion underscoring its restive lyrics. Alongside the blistering drums and s
 corched-earth riffs that first galvanized Pile’s dedicated fanbase\, the
  band has incorporated elegiac strings\, mystifying vocal corrosions\, and
  haunting synths. From the creeping fear of cinematic opener “It Comes C
 loser” to the euphorically ascending keys on ego-shattering closer “Ne
 on Gray\,” All Fiction is an ornate\, carefully paced study on the subje
 ctivity of perception\, the data-shaping despotism of big tech\, and the c
 onnections between anxiety and death. In its most vital moments\, it’s a
 lso a resolute recommitment to the restorative significance of art and ima
 gination.\n \nFor fifteen years\, Pile’s evolving take on rock has earne
 d the group one oft-repeated superlative: “your favorite band’s favori
 te band.” Ceaseless touring took its members from Boston’s basement ci
 rcuit to international festivals\, hitting loftier technical apexes with e
 ach new record. Maguire—the fastidious composer\, evocative guitarist\, 
 and potent voice behind the solo-turned-punk project—gives musical body 
 to his interior world in scream-along-able lyrics that skew surreal. \nCO
 R DE LUX\nCOR DE LUX grew out of the music scene of North Carolina’s Out
 er Banks in 2018. The band found each other over a by chance conversation 
 about a love of music between its two founding members (guitarist Tim Lusk
 \, and guitarist and vocalist\, Dawn Moraga) while Moraga waited for a pho
 ne repair in Tim’s shop. This turned out to be the catalyst for their ba
 nd’s formation\, with John Bliven quickly added on bass and Thomas McNee
 ly stepping in for founding member and drummer Dana Quinn in early 2022. T
 heir music (a mixture of post-punk\, goth-tinged pop and shoegaze) has ear
 ned the tongue-in-cheek nickname ‘Shoe-Gazi’ by friends.\n

 8PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nUNDERGANG\n \nUNDERGANG was form
 ed in the summer of 2008 in the heart of Copenhagen\, Denmark\, and was th
 e creation of long needs for creating raw and ignorant heavy death metal\,
  something that wasn’t as widespread in the international\, and even les
 s national\, extreme metal scene at the time. Formed and driven with the p
 assion for the genre and little care for other people’s acceptance and i
 nterest\, the band wrote and recorded what they intended to be their debut
  album “Indhentet af døden” during the winter of 2008/2009\, supporte
 d by having played a variety of local shows in the Danish capital region. 
 The debut album eventually got released in January 2010 by the UK based ne
 wly founded label Me Saco Un Ojo Records and a little later the Spanish la
 bel Xtreem Music\, with whom they signed a contract for the first and seco
 nd album. 2010 and 2011 was spent playing various shows and festivals arou
 nd Europe and even their first appearance in the US on a 2011 West Coast t
 our for three weeks around the Chaos in Tejas festival in Austin\, Texas. 
 The sophomore album “Til døden os skiller” was released on LP/CD in F
 ebruary 2012 and supported by a European tour the same month and two month
 s later a support job in Brooklyn in New York opening for death metal lege
 nds AUTOPSY.\n \n \n \nHaving cut down on touring activities in recent ye

 to the US for the first time since 2017 to play a small selection of speci

 ody is a temple. For Miasmatic Necrosis\, proclaiming its rotting pews and
  rafters is just the beginning of a pilgrimage toward transcendence throug
 h the esoteric rites of corpus in extremis. The quartet’s fervor is evan
 gelized through death metal-inspired goregrind\, reverential to the spirit
 s of early Carcass\, Regurgitate\, and Dead Infection. \nOn debut LP Apex 
 Profane\, instruments are calibrated to bowel-loosening timbres\, yet slic
 e with the precision of scalpels as a triumvirate of pitch-shifted pontifi
 ces preaches sermons of suppuration. Ecstatic devotees describe it as “b
 arbarous\,” “destructive” (From Corners Unknown) and “filled to th
 e brim with mood and depravity” (Boston Hassle). Since offering this eme

 other. It was that weird energy\, where you’re fed up and you’re kind 
 of angry\, but in a good way. We would spend like two nights a week writin
 g\, maybe once or twice a month\, sometimes less.” This went on for abou
 t a year\, with all the members bringing in their contributions\, until it
  came time to record—which\, in typical punk rock fashion\, had its own 
 set of obstacles to overcome.The bulk of Warmduscher’s discography – t
 he aforementioned Tainted Lunch\, as well as 2018’s Whale City and 2016
 ’s Khaki Tears – were produced by London stalwart Dan Carey\, who was 
 instrumental in helping the band hone their fuzzed out sound. Unfortunatel
 y\, at the beginning of At the Hotspot’s recording process\, Dan caught 
 COVID\, and the band found themselves having to leave their comfort zone a

 s circumstances. “I was in the studio with Joe and Al of Hot Chip\, doin
 g an electronic project with Igor Cavallera of Sepultura and his wife\, ar
 tist/musician Laima\,” explains Clams. “When I got the message saying 
 Dan couldn’t do the album\, I was like\, ‘Aw\, fuck!’ Then Joe and A
 l were simply like\, ‘We’ll do it!’ It was this really weird\, happy
  accident.”While At the Hotspot is still very much a Warmduscher album\,
  with all its cracks and crevices oozing garage rock bravado\, the product
 ion values buff out those jagged edges in a way only these two virtuoso pr
 oducers could have pulled off. “We’re just really psyched to play this
  whole thing live now\,” states Clams matter-of-factly. “And it’s a 
 whole revamp—new label\, new producers\, new logo—new everything.”\n

 their music and stance defy stereotypic norms of rock musicians being open

  Born Without Bones album\, that’s unlike anything Scott Ayotte has ever
  written before. That’s not because of the evolution of the Milford\, MA
  outfit from solo project to fully-fledged band\, either. Guitarist Jonath
 an Brucato and bassist Jim Creighton have been a part of the permanent lin
 e-up for a long time now\, and Super American’s Sam Checkoway – who pl
 ayed on last year’s re-recorded retrospective EP\, Pictures Of The Sun 
 – was behind the kit for the whole record\, the first time in the band
 ’s history that that’s happened. This goes even deeper. It’s the fir
 st time that Ayotte has written a love song that’s not about love going 
 or having gone wrong. Quite the opposite\, in fact.\n \n“It’s written 
 not from the perspective of having lost love but having gained love\,” h
 e explains. “Before\, I didn’t write about any relationships until the
 y were over\, and it wasn’t usually in the most positive way. But this i
 s a positive song I wrote for and about my girlfriend. Even though it says
  the nice things about her\, I decided to keep in the not so nice things a
 bout me – because she’s also signing up for those. Luckily\, she’s l
 oving of both.” \n \nTHE VAUGHNS\n \nEqual Vision Records and NJ/NYC-ba

 “You’re My Lover Now is a population explosion. Songs fling shards of 
 narrative about dozens of characters: lovers\, friends\, schoolkids\, pare

 . Christina Black of Time Out New York said\, “Insecurity and existentia
 l crisis are the dominant themes on You’re My Lover Now. The album’s p
 sychological tales are presented in a disjointed\, stream-of-consciousness
  manner\, infused with anxious-sounding arrangements.” The Teeth also re
 ceived much critical acclaim for their live shows.  Daytrotter wrote\, 
 “[The Teeth] comprise the wiliest\, most inventive and shakingest live r
 ock and roll band that this green earth has ever had the privilege of clai

 ntroduced to a whole new audience of people with the song “Ball of the D
