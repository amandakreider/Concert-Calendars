 – Doors9 PM – Show\n \nAARON LEE TASJANSinger\, songwriter\, guitarist
 \, producer\, band leader\, activist\, and Grammy nominee. Aaron Lee Tasj
 an has been and continues to be all of these things. Over his past decade
  plus of writing\, recording\, producing\, Tasjan has released four excell
 ent and critically acclaimed solo albums\, toured the world over on his ow
 n and as the guitarist in the New York Dolls. He co-founded and co-wrote a
 ll of the material for the band Semi Precious Weapons. In 2021 he was nomi
 nated for a Grammy for his writing on Yola’s “Diamond Studded Shoes”
  and most recently\, Tasjan produced Mya Byrne’s album Rhinestone Tomboy
  (Kill Rock Stars Nashville) which helped to establish her as one of the f
 irst openly trans artists in Americana Music. He’s cultivated a brillia
 nt and outstanding career to date already. But his forthcoming album Stell
 ar Evolution (Blue Élan Records) is just what the title says. Tasjan’s 
 new album is truly the sum of all of the parts of his diverse accomplishme
 nts to date while clearly heading in a brand-new direction. You can’t pu
 t any labels on Stellar Evolution except for it being a career defining wo
 rk and a major leap forward for someone who’s never been afraid to push 
 the boundaries of any and all expectations.\n \nMOLLY MARTINMolly Martin
 ’s debut album Mary released January 2023 is cheeky indie rock reminisce
 nt of early Smashing Pumpkins\, Land of Talk\, and the attitude of the Pre
 tenders. It’s music that pretends not to care about your feelings but re
 ally does. It’s a spotlight on the honest truth of Molly’s experience 
 before and after quitting drinking\; an 8-song inquiry into self-discovery
 . Molly’s birth name is Mary\, and each track feels like a different asp
 ect of the intersection between a buttoned-up Mary and a buttoned-down Mol
 ly. Nowhere near sacred and naturally profane\, Mary is a think piece on e
 verything from self-hatred to sexual assault. Something is bound to resona
 te\, and that’s the point.\n

 – Doors8 PM – Show\n \nSAM EVIANIt was New Years Eve 2022\, the night 
 before Sam Evian started recording Plunge\, his fourth LP\, now set for re
 lease on Flying Cloud Recordings via Thirty Tigers – his first album on 
 his new imprint. He invited his friends and fellow musicians to his proper
 ty in the Catskills\, where he’d just painstakingly relocated and revamp
 ed his Flying Clouds Studios into a new barn on the property\, restoring a
  vintage console and tape deck from 1974. Adrianne Lenker brought a jug of
  maple syrup from Vermont\, Sufjan Stevens set off fireworks in the meadow
 \, and at midnight\, the group of friends cold-plunged into a nearby creek
  as it started snowing. The next day\, the Plunge sessions began\, and th
 e album was tracked in the early winter months of 2023 over a 10-day perio
 d. Joined by a group of his closest friends and collaborators (including L
 iam Kazar\, Sean Mullins\, El Kempner of Palehound and Adrianne Lenker of 
 Big Thief)\, the young artist / producer set out with a wide-open approach
 . “No-one knew the songs or what the plan was. We kept it loose and fun.
  This was the spirit of the sessions. No headphones\, no playback\, minima
 l overdubs\, or bleed. Fast and loose.”The result is Evian’s best albu
 m to date: a cathartic rock record that melds power pop\, iridescent guita
 r\, raucous psychedelia\, and Sam’s now sought-after grooves. The music 
 is both fresh and familiar\, sonically inspired by his penchant for early 
 70s production and creatively propelled by the free-spirited process depic
 ted in the Beatles documentary Get Back\, as well as his urge to let go.\n

 – Doors8 PM – Show\n \nPACKSMadeline Link\, who makes music under the 
 moniker PACKS\, has always found inspiration in her surroundings.  When i
 t came to newest effort Melt the Honey (her second full-length in the spac
 e of a year)\, she wanted to look beyond the mundane spaces that had infor
 med much of her previous work.  Over the course of 11 days last March\, L
 ink and the rest of her band (Dexter Nash [guitar]\, Noah O’Neil [bass] 
 and Shane Hooper [drums]) gathered in Mexico City\, a city that already he
 ld a special place in her heart as an artist-in-residence at Casa Lü in 2
 020).  PACKS practiced new songs in a rented studio space\, with each mem
 ber bringing their aesthetic sensibility to the table. From there\, they t
 ook a bus to Xalapa where they spent the remainder of their time abroad wo
 rking at a house known as Casa pulpo\, an architectural feat removed from 
 the bustle of city life\, owned and operated by Wendy Moira\, the visionar
 y behind Teatro Lucido\, a prominent theater and music venue in Mexico Cit
 y. “The house has no straight lines\, it puts you in a creative mindset\
 ,” Link says. “Plus\, it was really warm\, we were there for three wee
 ks enjoying the weather and self-recording with minimal equipment.”Melt 
 the Honey emulates the environment in which it was made\; it’s a warm\, 
 unvarnished album\, one that invites the listener into PACKS’s familial 
 way of working. Listening to it makes one feel as if they were there in th
 e forests of Veracruz while the band laid down tracks. “Paige Machine”
  opens with the hiss of rain from an epic thunderstorm as Hooper counts in
  the song that was inspired by Mark Twain. “He invested in a printing de
 vice called the Paige Compositor\, spent his life’s savings on it\, and 
 it worked almost perfectly\, it would have been revolutionary\,” Link ex
 plains. “But then the inventor\, Paige\, took it apart to tweak somethin
 g\, make the machine work even better\, and it never worked again. They sa
 y that this failure led to Mark Twain’s decline.” To Link\, the Paige 
 Machine is an apt metaphor for life\, wherein our stubborn\, progress-hung
 ry attempts to improve what is already working can lead to obsessive tinke
 ring and endless re-dos. Embracing imperfection proved critical while reco
 rding at Casa pulpo\, where outages caused by storms and inconsistent elec
 trical wiring ended up serving the record’s ethos rather than hindering 
 it. Another stand-out track\, “HFCS\,” begins with Link singing a note
  far out of her typical register. “I dunno if that’s gonna work\,” s
 he says\, laughing\, before the bold lead guitar part takes over\, launchi
 ng them into a straight-up power pop song reminiscent of the Hives. It’s
  a song that’ll get the crowd moving\, as Link sings about the tantalizi
 ng\, if sickening\, promise of downing a bottle of Crown high fructose cor
 n syrup\, just for the thrill of it. “It’s about that creepy rush of a
 drenaline\,” she says. “Like when you drink a lot of pop or get a text
  from a crush.”\nDOLL SPIRIT VESSEL (Solo)\n

 – Doors9 PM – Show\n \nSADURNIntimacy is manifested in every moment of
  “Radiator\,” the debut album from Philadelphia’s Sadurn. This feeli
 ng of closeness\, of being able to lend your every sense to one’s confes
 sions of internal conflict\, has carried over from the band’s origins as
  the solo bedroom-folk project of frontperson Genevieve DeGroot. Now emer
 ging as a four-piece with the addition of members Jon Cox\, Tabitha Ahnert
 \, and Amelia Swain\, Sadurn delivers emotive indie rock on “Radiator”
  that explores the struggles and eventual beauty of grappling with multipl
 e emotional realities\, particularly when it comes to relationships. The a
 lbum is a fleeting\, impactful glimpse at one’s whole heart\, and its sw
 eeping\, special nature is evident from the moment it opens.\nGREG FREEMAN
 “Greg Freeman deals in biblical deluges\, apocalyptic fever dreams\, Flo
 ridian miscreants\, and green mountain malaise. On his excellent debut LP 
 “I Looked Out\,” Gregs’s voice takes center stage\, creaking\, croon
 ing\, and cutting through clouds of static. The songs are linked together 
 by a palpable urgency\, whether it is the punch-in-the-face\, careening mo
 mentum of “Tower\,” the country-gazing guitar squall of “Souvenir He
 art\,” or the singalong finale of “Palms.” Careful arrangements and 
 production choices bring out the best of the 7-piece band that ornament th
 e album with pedal steel\, horns\, eerie strings\, and tape warbles. Greg
 ’s strong narrative songwriting is equally effective chronicling the dem
 ise of a 1920s ocean liner as it is documenting his own interpersonal unce
 rtainties. The sounds on the record conjure up the feeling of driving arou
 nd Chittenden County in the middle of winter\, high beams on\, slush on th
 e floor mats. It’s hard for me to imagine a more promising debut record\
 , and I can’t wait to see where this band goes next.” – Garrett Linc

 e craft of songwriting is 100% what I’m about\,” says Dent May. “Tha
 t’s what keeps me going. My goal is to just live a long life and write a
  ton of good songs.” With the Mississippi-raised\, Los Angeles-based mus
 ician and pop auteur what you see is what you get: a restless and prolific
  artist who worships at the altar of a memorable hook and a sharp lyric. T
 here is no gimmick or press-ready narrative about May overcoming past trau
 ma\, mental breakdowns\, or surpassing insurmountable obstacles. This is s
 imply a guy who is extraordinarily good at making warm and inviting tunes.
  He’s done it for over 15 years and isn’t stopping anytime soon. The 
 38-year-old artist has made a career of impeccably crafted pop songs start
 ing with his 2009 debut The Good Feeling Music of Dent May &amp\; His Magn
 ificent Ukulele\, which came out on Animal Collective’s label Paw Tracks
 . His follow-ups in 2012’s Do Things and 2013’s Warm Blanket solidifie
 d him as a bedroom pop pioneer whose songs felt equally timeless and ahead
 - of-the-curve. Following a move from Mississippi to Los Angeles\, May sig
 ned with Carpark and released two increasingly adventurous albums in the p
 sychedelic Across the Multiverse from 2017 and the silky Late Checkout in 
 2020. His latest LP is What’s For Breakfast?\, his sixth album and thir
 d with Carpark\, marks a shift from timeless pop to more guitar-driven roc
 k. The 10-song collection is some of May’s most energetic and immediate 
 tunes yet. It mirrors his relentlessly prolific streak\, which includes pl
 atinum- certified singles with Eyedress and guest appearances with The Und
 ercover Dream Lovers\, Bob Jr.\, and Paul Cherry. Alongside two other arti
 sts\, he operates and works out of the recording studio Honeymoon Suite in
  northeast Los Angeles.\n \nJIMMY WHISPERSA lot has changed for everyone o
 ver the 8 years since Jimmy Whispers released his debut LP\, especially fo
 r Jimmy himself. In another lifetime\, he was that sweet kid from Chicago 
 who stole our hearts with his aw-shucks Midwestern attitude and his knack 
 for writing catchy old-time melodies. Legendary critic Jessica Hopper once
  called him the city’s “greatest new homegrown musical enigma\,” and
  he turned a mixtape of iPhone voice memos (Summer in Pain) into a profoun
 d racket\, that saw him perform at the Pitchfork Music Festival and earn p
 raise from that outlet and places like Stereogum\, Spin\, BrooklynVegan\, 
 VICE\, NME\, and many others. If you caught a glimpse\, it was exciting\, 
 but it was just a warm-up to his second act. As for today\, Jimmy Whispers
  is alive and well in Los Angeles. He’s still making music—quite a lot
  of it. He’s got a blossoming new career as a music video director and f
 ilmmaker. He’s become a co-writer for others including Drugdealer and De
 nt May. He’s got his sobriety\, a new commitment to making life-a ffi rm
 ing art\, and a 1988 Buick Reatta. Jimmy Whispers has returned with a new 
 LP The Search For God out June 9th on Carpark Records. His first since his
  2015 debut\, the album was co-produced by Ziyad Asrar of the band Whitney
 \, and returns to some jewel-box era teen influences out of step with the 
 chill/lo-fi LA indie rock scene he’s found himself lumped in with.\n

 – Doors8 PM – Show\n \nWAYFARERWAYFARER (Century Media) is the pre-emi
 nent Western American Metal band. Composed of four black clad players from
  Denver\, Colorado\, the band’s sound draws from the deep wells of black
  metal\, gothic country\, and americana – creating a thunderous and uniq
 uely American genre of metal all to their own. After ten years of existenc
 e\, the band presents AMERICAN GOTHIC – a defining statement of Western 
 heavy music that explores the dark soul of the nation itself. This time wo
 rking alongside accomplished producer Arthur Rizk (Eternal Champion\, Krea
 tor) the band brings an aggressive and expansive vision to life in a new f
 ull length LP. Led by powerful riffing\, bleak melodic sensibilities\, and
  pointed songwriting\, this record serves as a funeral for the American dr
 eam. Caked in dust\, and buried deep in blood and gunpowder\, it paints a 
 brutal and beautiful portrait\, and sees WAYFARER elevate their unique and
  genuine brand of metal to new heights. “What we have now is a world ful
 l of oil drillers\, and railroad barons. Cattle thieves and company men. T
 his is the new American Gothic.”\n \nSONJAIn 2014\, Melissa Moore birthe
 d the idea for the Gothic Rock Heavy Metal band Sonja while having an exis
 tential meltdown on a strung out flight home from Melbourne to Philadelphi
 a. After calling drummer Grzesiek Czapla upon landing and later inviting b
 assist Ben Brand\, the power trio plunged deep into secret places where fe
 ar and pain were transformed into obsessive pop hook-laced metal. The year
 s that followed were filled with ruinous sexuality\, gender apocalypse\, c
 asual encounters\, generosity\, discretion\, danger\, desire\, paranoia\, 
 passion\, and endless rock n roll. “Loud Arriver” is the band’s 202
 2 debut full length that was released on Cruz Del Sur Music (mixed by Arth
 ur Rizk). Featuring the Zev Deans directed music video for “Nylon Nights
 ”\, Sonja began the perpetual cycle of touring the US and Europe. Festiv

 and are pulled deeper into submission to their goddess\, Heavy Metal.\n \n

  something cosmically beautiful. Another Michael exists for that moment: w
 hen a song transforms the setting of a long walk home\, or speaks to a pas
 t experience while simultaneously making a new one\, or taps into somethin
 g universal by relating details so specific and personal that they could o
 nly be revealed in music. In 2023 the band released Wishes To Fulfill\, th
 e first in a pair of albums dedicated to their love of song\, and now they
 ’re back already with the experimental next chapter\, Pick Me Up\, Turn 
 Me Upside Down. Together\, the dual LPs create and pay tribute to the powe
 r of transcendent musical moments. Wishes To Fulfill and Pick Me Up\, Tur

 o\, “It’s not a purposeful decision to talk about music in our songs b
 ut it just inherently means so much to us. If something makes your heart s
 ing\, the audience is going to hear it.” On Wishes To Fulfill and Pick M

 \n7 PM – Doors8 PM – Show\n \nSTEREO LEAGUE \n \nFormed in 2016\, Ster
 eo League is driven by the songwriting of childhood friends Alex Savoth an
 d Dan King. Initially a studio project formed with the help of Engineer an
 d Producer Eric Bogacz\, the three began crafting songs and recruiting a c
 ast of friends to fill in the gaps. Pretty soon\, The League had grown to 
 a dozen members and the result was their debut album “A Light on Each Si
 de”. Often appearing live as a six-piece band\, the group has incorporat
 ed influences from a plethora of genres\, both modern and classic\, refusi
 ng to be boxed in by conventional labels. The outcome is an ever-changing 
 musical landscape that continues to evolve along with their line-up. On t
 heir last EP Endless Mirage\, Savoth and King collaborated with the Synth 
 & Soul record label and production crew Eraserhood Sound. The result is a 
 timeless\, shimmering collection of songs that tell evocative tales of lon
 eliness and longing\, set against the backdrop of Eraserhood Sound’s sig
 nature analog production. Stereo League\, who was previously named Artist 
 to Watch by Philadelphia’s WXPN\, believes this release to be the cleare
 st and best representation of their vision to date— delivering the soulf
 ul sound they have been searching for.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nANGELO OUTLAW\n 
 \nAngelo Outlaw is a deeply cosmic artist whose creativity knows no bounds
 . He is a master mallet percussionist and a thoughtful poet\, and is final
 ly getting the shine that he has for so long deserved. In 2020\, Outlaw co
 nnected with fellow Philadelphians Eraserhood Sound. Together\, the partie
 s have released a string of synth & soul masterpieces\, including the high
 ly sought-after Time Traveler / Silent Horizon 7″ that was released in 2
 022. With this blazing hot two-sider\, Angelo asserted himself as a force 
 in the modern cosmic soul jazz universe. In early 2024\, Eraserhood Sound 
 released Angelo’s debut full-length album Axis of Time. According to Out
 law\, the record is meant to transport the listener to a dream-like state\
 , where space and time slowly fade away and reality is merely a distant me
 mory. From the euphoric highs of lead single “Free My Mind” and uninhi
 bited groove of “Speed of Light” to the trance-like meditation of “D
 reams” and mournful melodies of “Invisible Clock\,” Angelo and the E
 HS house band truly go to the cosmos and back. Axis of Time is an extraord
 inary debut from Outlaw\, a young gay Black man who hopes to serve as an i
 nspiration to others who might be perceived as different or other. His wor
 k transcends race\, creed\, religion\, and politics\, and has the power to
  speak to the universality of time\, space\, and human connection.\n \n \

 You Feel Alone at Parties\, which FLOOD Magazine praised as “not only a 
 must-listen\, but a must-repeat-listen\, many times in a row\; a lo-fi\, r
 hythm-and-blues-and-indie\, heartbreaking mini-epic about growing up and o

  freedom and weirdness that manifests itself in a confident genre agnostic
  journey that seamlessly transitions between twinkly midwest emo guitars\,
  early aughts Lower East Side indie rock\, woozy chillwave\, spoken word a
 nd jazz. With songs structured more like acts in a play than your typical 
 verse / chorus / verse\, at every turn the listener comes across something
  delightfully unexpected. And in a nod to the rich musical history of the 
 band’s hometown\, and the underappreciated present day artistic scene th
 erein\, a choir of Memphis artists contribute their voices to various song
 s\, acting as a storytelling device tying the record’s various threads t
 ogether. That Memphis chorus fittingly closes out the album in joyful reve
 rie as Shaw expounds upon an apprehensive but hopeful message to anyone li
 stening. “I definitely haven’t made it over the mountain\, but I’ve 
 gotten higher than I’ve ever been so far.”\nGROCER\nKING AZAZ\n

  – Doors9 PM – Show\n \n\nSLOMO SAPIENS Slomo Sapiens originated back
  in 2016 when lead guitarist & frontman Ceallaigh Manaaki moved across the
  planet from New Zealand to America. If you believe in horoscopes\, ghosts
 \, and fairy tales\, you might think it was fate that Ceallaigh met Greg G
 eiger (bass) and Jon Pritchard (drums) within his first week in Philadelph
 ia. The three piece dropped their debut EP Hot Milk in 2018 as a concise t
 hesis on Psych\, Garage\, and Sludge Rock.\nAs the band evolved\, they dug
  deeper into a psychedelic abyss and crafted their first LP Cabin Fever Dr
 eams. The aptly titled record’s release coincidentally paired with the e
 ntire world shutting down for the first time in March of 2020. With no end
  in sight\, the band couldn’t help but feel that fate had played a dirty
  trick on them this time. The darkest moments on CFD highlight the horrors
  of isolation with references to Kenneth Anger & Allister Crowley while pu
 lling musical influence from The Cramps & The 13th Floor Elevators.\nSince
  then\, the boys explored their Stoner Metal alter egos on Slömos Vol 1 i
 n 2021 and joined forces with multi-instrumentalist Michael Sanzo (Dawn Dr
 apes\, XIXIX) to expand their presence in Philadelphia’s prolific and in
 finite music scene.\nThe band has finally finished their sophomore album T
 he Holy Babble and has already released the first single ‘Tongues ii’.
  With ‘Tongues ii’\, the band unleashes their maximalist sound\, compl
 ete with a Krautrock-inspired intro\, swarming textures\, and an aphotic d
 epth of layers. It’s almost as if the psych rock monster they created ha
 s mutated\, sprouted a few extra legs\, and reached a new stage of evoluti
 on. A stage post-sapien.\nWAX JAW\n\n \n \nFLATWAVES\n \n \n\n\n

  her new album And Southern Star––a truly collaborative effort that ru
 minates on the choices we make\, and the people we always come back to.Dav
 is earned her degree in harp performance at the Crane School of Music\, an

 bending catalog that weaves together 60s pop-soaked melodies\, psychedelia
  and driving folk rock. She met her bandmates at pivotal moments in her li
 fe––drummer Alex Coté in childhood\, guitarist Cian McCarthy and bass
 ist Shane McCarthy in college\, and steel guitarist Kurt Johnson in her ea
 rly twenties. It’s the band’s collective step into adulthood that has 
 informed much of And Southern Star’s thematic landscape.Navigating the p
 eriphery of past selves\, the coexistence of isolation and excitement in a
  new environment and the tension of growing away from what we thought we w
 anted is tackled with a luscious\, kaleidoscopic grace. And Southern Star 
 picks apart the reflection we used to recognise\, while trying to build a 
 new one. “I finally feel like this album is more me than anything else t
 hat’s been released\,” Davis says\, adding that producing the album al
 ong with her four bandmates allowed them to carve out their own ideas\, ra
 ther than someone else’s. Despite playing together for over a decade\, i
 t’s the first time the five-piece have appeared on a full length album t

  of the Aïr region”) welcomes you to Agadez\, the capital city of Sahar
 an rock. Playing for over 25 years\, Etran has emerged as stars of the loc
 al wedding circuit. Beloved for their dynamic repertoire of hypnotic solos
  and sun schlazed melodies\, Etran stakes out a place for Agadez guitar mu
 sic. Playing a sound that invokes the desert metropolis\, “Agadez” cel
 ebrates the sounds of all the dynamism of a hometown wedding.Etran is a fa
 mily band composed of brothers and cousins\, all born and raised in the sm
 all neighborhood of Abalane\, just in the shadow of the grand mosque. Sons
  of nomadic families that settled here in the 1970s fleeing the droughts\,
  they all grew up in Agadez. The band was formed in 1995 when current band
  leader Moussa “Abindi” Ibra was only 9 years old. “We only had one 
 acoustic guitar\,” he explains\, “and for percussion\, we hit a calaba
 sh with a sandal.” Over the decades\, the band painstakingly pieced toge
 ther gear to form their band and built an audience by playing everywhere\,
  for everyone. “It was difficult. We would walk to gigs by foot\, luggin
 g all our equipment\, carrying a small PA and guitars on our backs\, 25 ki
 lometers into the bush\, to play for free…there’s nowhere in Agadez we
  haven’t played.”From the days of the Trans-Saharan caravan in the 14t
 h century to a modern-day stopover for Europe-bound migrants\, Agadez is a
  city that stands at the crossroads\, where people and ideas come together
 . Understandably\, it’s here where one of the most ambitious Tuareg guit
 ar has taken hold. Agadez’s style is the fastest\, with frenetic electri
 c guitar solos\, staccato crash of full drum kits\, and flamboyant dancing
  guitarists. Agadez is the place where artists come to cut their teeth in 
 a lucrative and competitive winner-take-all scene. Guitar bands are an int
 egral part of the social fabric\, playing in weddings\, baptisms\, and pol
 itical rallies\, as well as the occasional concert.\n

 on\, Mickey Drexler Faye Webster\, Bowen Yang\, and many more – are tied

 in a real conversation.How Long Gone is a podcast that was created out of 
 pandemic boredom by two old friends. Chris was in New York and Jason was i

 ke a podcast and ended up creating a cosmos instead. As Chris told Vogue\,

 ding through the soft solitary night\, crystalline silence of the mind\, i
 mpenetrable as an atom\, stars shining down bright\, the heavenly light su
 rrounds you completely. You are nowhere. The Lunar Sludge Band plays all n
 ight long forever and ever\, they’re always changing\, people always com
 ing and going and coming back again. But the band plays on long after we
 ’re gone.  Echo Kid is a sludge rock n’ roll duo from Philadelphia co
 mprised of multi-instrumentalists Brendan McHale and Christian Turzo. Conc
 eived through a shared love of raw\, DIY recording techniques\, light-hear
 ted lyrics\, and weirdo rock’n’roll\, the pair began writing and recor
 ding music in earnest throughout 2019 while living together in Fairmount\,
  Philadelphia.PINE BARONS – 10:00 PMThe band’s debut LP\, The Acchin B
 ook (released in 2017)\, possessed a unique quality from the auxiliary ins
 truments and recording techniques used\; feathered paper dragged across pa
 intings\, field recordings in the woods at night\, accordion\, string arra
 ngements and bowed guitars all contributing to the various moods and textu
 res of the record. Pine Barons’ follow up effort\, 2020’s Mirage on th
 e Meadow\, released during the throes of the pandemic\, was a more insular
  effort\, as all songs were written\, produced and engineered by frontpers
 on & multi-instrumentalist\, KC Abrams\, who explored themes of human conn
 ection while acknowledging impermanence and death’s inevitability. Sonic
 ally\, Mirage on the Meadow is a psychedelic amalgamation of graveyard shi
 fting indie rock – full of the dread we all experience while retaining a
  cautious optimism that propels its rich\, colorful sound towards a bright
 er future.  During the mixing process\, Abrams stumbled upon the music of
  cult favorite Japanese band\, Fishmans (active throughout the late 80’s
  and 90’s) and fell in love with their peerless mix of dream pop\, psych
 edelic rock\, trip-hop and dub/reggae. Unable to speak the Japanese langua
 ge himself\, Abrams set out to discover what the lyrics actually meant\, a
 nd with the help of a Japanese-speaking friend\, came up with lyrical Engl
 ish interpretations of the late Shinji Sato’s words. After Sato’s copy
 right successor passed along his blessing to move forward\, I LOVE FISH wa
 s officially born.  I LOVE FISH is a tribute album in the truest sense. A
 lso produced and engineered in house\, Pine Barons brings its own flavor t
 o the arrangements and compositions that comprise nine Fishmans songs\, in
 cluding ambitious fan favorite\, the 30-minute plus “LONG SEASON”\, a 
 song that has never been attempted as a cover before. Abrams recalls heari
 ng Sato’s voice for the first time\, noticing that “without even knowi
 ng what the lyrics were\, I felt such a strong connection to the voice tha
 t sang them. It confirms to me the genuine beauty of that voice and how un
 iversal music truly is.”\nTISBURYS – 9:00 PMThe Tisburys are an indie 
 rock band from Philadelphia\, PA led by singer-songwriter Tyler Asay. The 
 band has released three full-length albums\, most recently 2022’s Exile 
 On Main Street\, which combines influences of heartland rock and power pop
  hooks with jangly guitars and gritty lyrical storytelling. Their music ha
 s received praise and radio play from NPR\, Little Steven’s Underground 
 Garage\, and 88.5 WXPN\, where they played the XPoNential Music Festival. 
 They have shared the stage with national acts (Gin Blossoms\, Jenny Lewis\
 , Drive-By Truckers\, Old 97’s) and local Philadelphia heroes such as Th
 e War On Drugs\, Baroness\, and Dave Hause.\n \n \n

 “Trampoline.” The runaway ascension of “Trampoline” led the band t

  following that unexpected success. Seeking a reset\, the trio emerged fro

 trumentalist/producer Doug Stuart has moved with ingenuity\, fusing psych-
 pop abstraction with dancefloor sensibilities. Through the body and mind\,
  rhythm and lyricism\, they make sense of the worlds around and within\; 2
 021’s Feelings celebrated self-reflection\; 2022’s Angelo processed lo
 ss\, coinciding with the duo’s first headlining tour\, which doubled dow
 n on the material’s desire to move. Now\, across the playful expanse of 
 Macro\, arriving in 2024 on Ghostly International\, Brijean engages differ
 ent sides of themselves\, the paradox of being alive. Murphy\, an accompl
 ished DJ\, session and live player in Oakland’s diverse music scene has 
 emerged as one of indie’s most in-demand percussionists. In 2018\, she b
 egan recording songs with multi- instrumentalist and producer Stuart\, who
  shares a background in jazz and pop in bands such as Bells Atlas\, Meerna
 a\, and Luke Temple. Eventually dubbed Brijean\, the project grew out of m
 arathon sessions at their intimate home-studio. Their first effort\, Walki
 e Talkie (released by Native Cat Recordings in 2019)\, found Murphy taking
  the mic for the first time to deliver dreamy dance tracks that felt home-
 cooked and effortlessly chic. Her layered percussion and hypnotic\, expres
 sive vocals coupled with Stuart’s production and harmonic palette evoked
  shades of disco\, ‘90s house\, and a sly pop sensibility. ”A smooth\,
  sumptuous\, and soulful record\,” said Bandcamp\, who helped propel the
  group’s early following. Murphy’s musical talents are family heirloo
 ms: her father\, percussionist and engineer Patrick Murphy\, taught Brijea
 n her first patterns on a pair of congas that she inherited from the late 
 Trinidadian steel drum legend Vince Charles (of Neil Diamond). Growing up 
 in LA’s Glassell Park\, Murphy was raised by a cadre of honorary aunts a
 nd uncles – a deep bench of jazz\, Latin and soul musicians in their own
  rites. This meant she grew up regaled by musical lore – larger-than-lif
 e tales of jazz luminaries\, psychedelic trips and obscure cultural enclav
 es – sampling some of those family stories and weaving them into her wor
 k. Growing up outside of Chicago\, Stuart found his way into jazz clubs an
 d festivals as a teenager\, frequently going to hear Jeff Parker\, Fred An
 derson\, and other members of the AACM. While attending the University of 
 Michigan\, he studied under Detroit jazz royalty\, Robert Hurst and Geri A
 llen. After college\, Stuart became intrigued by the music of J Dilla and 
 Moodymann\, and began learning production and exploring the connections be
 tween jazz\, house\, and hip-hop.\n

 e Anymore’ follows 2017’s ‘Music for the Age of Miracles’ (which a
 rrived after a seven-year hiatus for the band)\, with new recording sessio
 ns beginning in 2019 and continuing piecemeal until 2022 —in part due to
  the pandemic and also because the band wanted the space to experiment. 
 “We’d always been interested in music other than guitar music\, like f
 or donkey’s years\,” vocalist/lyricist/guitarist Alasdair MacLean says
 . This time out\, he — alongside bassist James Hornsey and drummer Mark 
 Keen — incorporated elements of post-bop jazz\, contemporary classical a
 nd electronic music. According to MacLean\, “None of those things had be
 en able to find their way into our sound other than in the most passing wa
 y\, in the faintest imprint.”This stretching out — what MacLean calls 
 “a leap forwards and to the side” — can be heard clearly in “Blue 
 Over Blue\,” with its percussive samples and its moments where the arran
 gement opens up suddenly into something cinematic in scope\, with horns an
 d strings. “What happened with this record was that we bought a computer
 \,” MacLean explains. Under the old Clientele way of recording\, a trick
 y song like “Blue Over Blue” might’ve eaten up all their studio time
 \, as they worked out the time signature and the instrumentation. For ‘I
  Am Not There Anymore\,’ though\, the trio would lay down a few tracks a
 nd then take them home to play around\, trying out different arrangements 
 before returning to the studio to finish recording all the little instrume
 ntal enhancements.“Blue Over Blue” depicts MacLean’s scary adventure
  of being lost in the woods with his son\, he explains: “‘Blue Over Bl
 ue’ is about getting lost in the woods on Hampstead Heath on an autumn d
 ay with my two-year-old son on my shoulders—he loved it and wanted to pl
 ay hide and seek. I knew he was a ticking time bomb as I had no food with 
 me and was trying to find my way back to a path.” The accompanying video
  sees the band adorned in armor beneath beautiful and abstract artwork.Ove
 r the 32-year career of the pop band The Clientele\, critics and fans have
  often described their songs with words like “ethereal\,” “shimmerin
 g\,” “hazy\,” “pretty” and “fragile.” MacLean\, though\, has
  his own interpretation of the effect his music creates. “It’s that fe
 eling of not being there\,” he says. “What’s really been in all the 
 Clientele records is a sense of not actually inhabiting the moment that yo
 ur body is in.”\n
