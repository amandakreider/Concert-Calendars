 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nWESTERMAN\n \nUK artist Westerman
  returns with his first offering in two years with the song “Idol\; RE-r
 un” out via Partisan Records. The new track\,produced by James Krivcheni
 a and Westerman\,juxtaposes gentle and celestial sonics with an aggrieved 
 disposition and features artwork by renownedNew York via Portugal Graphic 
 Designer and Illustrator Bráulio Amado. The song was written after Wester
 man emergedfrom a period of disenchantment with making music\, and with th
 e future of his career feeling abstract\, it seemed unclear to Westerman w
 hether the material he was recording would ever be heard. Creatively\, thi
 s offered a strange kind of freedom\, and accommodated some of the most ad
 venturous and unselfconscious songwriting of his career. Finding textures 
 became a central concern taking programming and looping into his own hands
  in a way he never had before\, creating polyrhythmic grooves to lend urge
 ncy to his inner dialogue.”Idol\; RE-run” is the first taste of songs 
 written in this period and provides a hint for what’s to come from Weste
 rman in the coming year. The track featuresJames Krivchenia\, Mikel Patric
 k Avery and Booker Stardrum on drums\, Ben Reed on bass\, Luke Temple on s
 ynth\, Mat Davidson on piano\, Robin Eubanks on the trombone and of course
  Westerman on vocals\, guitar and synth.Speaking about the new song\, West
 erman shares:”The lyrics to the song were written around the same time a
 s the storming of the Capitol. The compulsion towards the pedestal is stro
 ng. The need to scapegoat and revere without logic. Our populists actively
  celebrate their being people who don’t know anything other or better th
 an anyone else\, yet these spectres with their failings conduct our anger 
 and resentment as if they were gods. They are nothing more than the shadow
  of something else\, the face fronting a need to be loved or revered prese
 nt in everyone. And there will always be another face to front.”\nTWAIN\
 n \nHave you ever…\n \n…faced an impossible question\, to be answered 
 at once by a kaleidoscope of wind\, diffusing your bewilderment into thous
 ands of spinning bulbs?\n \n…awoken to hear the person sleeping beside y
 ou speaking a language they do not speak in their waking life? …felt y
 our legs possessed\, to throw you across the room in shapes? …lost you
 r heart\, only to find it on the bank of a cold spring\, in the hands of a
  filling station attendant\, or in the dust swimming through the light of 
 your bedroom window?\n \n Have you ever listened to Twain?\n \n“A lone
 ly day\, I went outside to smoke awhile\,and think about a picture in a bo
 ok:He was laying in the grass in his suit\,as the angler posed in pursuit 
 of the fish”\n \n For the past decade or so\, Mt. Davidson has cultiva
 ted his songs and sounds\, attempting to create a bridge\, a meeting place
 \, between the terrestrial and the mystic.  He is a ponderous and delicat
 e sort of creature\, short and vaguely leonine\, who has spent most of his
  young life abiding in the midlands of transcendence.\nMASON LINDAHL\nMaso
 n Lindahl is a guitarist and composer based in New York City. His finger-p
 icking style is largely influenced by minimalism and classical music. He g
 rew up listening to folk and country music in Northern California\, where 
 he was first taught to play the guitar by his father.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nNARROW HEAD\n \nTruly great pop s
 ongs do not require a cheery outlook in order to work\, nor do they pander
  to expectations of syrupy sweet easy-listening. Rather\, the best pop mus
 ic is a matter of refinement and pure intention\, of dialing groove to mel
 ody so that the two might puncture the malaise of everyday living in uniso
 n\, revealing some brief\, sober truth about our shared human condition. O
 n their third LP\, Moments of Clarity (Run for Cover)\, Narrow Head have a
 chieved precisely this feat. Traversing the depths of massive\, churning r
 iffs\, often distorted to the point of violence\, bouncing\, lock-grooved 
 rhythms\, and crystalline\, gorgeously constructed hooks\, the Houston-bas
 ed outfit puts on a masterclass in the art of writing songs that match the
  pain\, pleasure\, and confusion of modern living. Each track is sentiment
 al without being precious\, heavy without unnecessary griminess\, pop-forw
 ard without letting the listener off the hook easy: these songs ask for so
 me form of hurt or desire to be paid back to them in return\, some promise
  that the listener is putting equal skin into the game.\n \n \n \nGRAHAM 
 HUNT\n \nWisconsin Musician Graham Hunt’s latest effort\, “If You Knew
  Would You Believe It?” (Smoking Room Records) is a journey that confide
 ntly tackles pop/rock from every possible sonic angle.  Hunt’s penchant
  for combining wistful melodies with lyrics that make stagnant moments fee
 l improbably vivid compliments an increasingly refined incorporation of 
 ’90s and early ’00s alt-rock touchstones. Through all of the familiari
 ty\, Hunt has managed to develop a style that feels authentically singular
 \, an honest extension of his tastes\, preferences\, and experiences.\n \n

 \n \n8PM – Show\nPINE BARONS\n \nThe band’s debut LP\, The Acchin Boo
 k (released in 2017)\, possessed a unique quality from the auxiliary inst
 ruments and recording techniques used\; feathered paper dragged across pai
 ntings\, field recordings in the woods at night\, accordion\, string arran
 gements and bowed guitars all contributing to the various moods and textur
 es of the record.\n \nIt was praised by Consequence who noted: “their co
 mplex arrangements echo the type of perplexing subject matter at hand\, an
 d their metaphorical lyricism sees them evoking a world beyond reality in 
 hopes of finding the right answers”.\n \nPine Barons’ follow up effort
 \, 2020’s Mirage on the Meadow\, released during the throes of the pand
 emic\, was a more insular effort\, as all songs were written\, produced an
 d engineered by frontperson & multi-instrumentalist\, KC Abrams\, who expl
 ored themes of human connection while acknowledging impermanence and death
 ’s inevitability. Sonically\, Mirage on the Meadow is a psychedelic am
 algamation of graveyard shifting indie rock – full of the dread we all e
 xperience while retaining a cautious optimism that propels its rich\, colo
 rful sound towards a brighter future.\n \nDuring the mixing process\, Abra
 ms stumbled upon the music of cult favorite Japanese band\, Fishmans (act
 ive throughout the late 80’s and 90’s) and fell in love with their pee
 rless mix of dream pop\, psychedelic rock\, trip-hop and dub/reggae. Unabl
 e to speak the Japanese language himself\, Abrams set out to discover what
  the lyrics actually meant\, and with the help of a Japanese-speaking frie
 nd\, came up with lyrical English interpretations of the late Shinji Sato
 ’s words. After Sato’s copyright successor passed along his blessing t
 o move forward\, I LOVE FISH was officially born.\n \nI LOVE FISH is a 
 tribute album in the truest sense. Also produced and engineered in house\,
  Pine Barons brings its own flavor to the arrangements and compositions th
 at comprise nine Fishmans songs\, including ambitious fan favorite\, the 
 30-minute plus “LONG SEASON”\, a song that has never been attempted as
  a cover before. Abrams recalls hearing Sato’s voice for the first time\
 , noticing that “without even knowing what the lyrics were\, I felt such
  a strong connection to the voice that sang them. It confirms to me the ge
 nuine beauty of that voice and how universal music truly is.”\nRENTBOY\n

 ure selves\; with the trees that adorn their old street\, and the door the
 y used to call home\; with the shadows of lovers-turned-to- friends and th
 e overwhelming cacophony of abrupt change. They’re drawing a map but the
  port of call is cloudy and indistinct. It’s while traveling along these
  nebulous contours that their latest album The Sun Still Seems To Move for
 ms a kind of physicality\, of outstretched giving hands\, that offers a gu
 ide through the fog. Here\, Moser examines the disorien- tating\, challeng

 LP\, Steel Country\, Tom cranks up the distortion in a gentle nod to shoeg
 aze that evokes senses of desolation and chaos that unfurl around him. Tom
 ’s always been fascinated by visual signs of desolation\, observing the 
 abandoned century structures in his Philadelphia neighborhood and dreaming
  up stories of what they must have been. It’s through this narrative pra

 cating Swim Camp to autobiography and confession.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nALEX LAHEY\n \n“Living in a wor
 ld that wasn’t made for you makes you pretty strong and adaptive\, and y
 ou find the fun in it\,” says Alex Lahey. “It also makes you realize h
 ow absurd everything is. With ‘The Answer Is Always Yes\,’ I wanted to
  get weird because the world is weird\, and it’s even weirder when you r
 ealize you don’t fit into it all the time.” It’s no secret that the
  world wasn’t built with most people in mind. For those who exist on the
  fringe\, you learn to pave your own way\, foster your own community\, and
  create your own joy. As a queer person and a daughter of migrants\, Lahey
  learned how to adapt to a world that wasn’t made for her\, and her thir
 d album\, The Answer Is Always Yes\, examines how she finds comfort in the
  discomfort\, whether it’s reveling in absurdity or turning towards expl
 oration. Lahey’s debut album I Love You Like a Brother and its 2019 foll
 ow-up The Best of Luck Club take their focus from the lens of relationship
 s\, but with The Answer Is Always Yes\, Lahey analyzes her otherness throu
 gh different lenses\, from its isolating effect to the surrealism and humo
 r it instills.\n \n \n \nLIZA ANNE\n \nIndie rock sensation Liza Anne dis

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nJANA HORN\n \nOptimism seemed to 
 come about indirectly\, almost in passing\, a feeling of being in-between 
 things. I was really mobile at that time\, living wherever. Half the songs
  came through in a week. “Jordan” perhaps the most out of the blue… 
 sitting there as I was on my brother’s couch in Austin. But I guess I do
 n’t think that anything comes from nowhere. Everything is writing to me.
  A grad professor once told me that masturbation is writing\, as long as y
 ou’re looking out a window.\nI had just discovered\, late\, Raymond Carv
 er Broadcast\, Sibylle Baier (which “Tonight” is more or less dedicate
 d to)\, Annette Peacock\, Richard & Linda Thompson\, a short story called 
 “Car Crash While Hitchhiking” by Denis Johnson. I had “Heart Needs a
  Home” in mind\, “The Great Valerio\;” I was just really moving thro
 ugh the world\, hanging in the shadows of the people I wanted to be. Hopin
 g\, looking out\, this is Optimism. I was looking for anything.\nIn 2018\,
  I took these ten songs into a studio in Austin with some members of the b
 and Knife in the Water. I’d been singing with them at the time and it fe
 lt right. My friend Ian\, who I’d been performing with as a duo for a fe
 w years\, was with me on drums. “Friends Again” and “Jordan” were 
 written in the process. “Jordan” was such an outlier\, I thought: I ca
 n’t put this on the album. Then at some point in the recording process\,
  decided to embrace it—the question of whether spiritual themes should b
 e a part of my work—which wouldn’t even be a question now. It’s in e
 verything. But at the time\, you know\, it was the first time\, and so the
  song kind of scared me\, like I was a mule for it instead of its owner.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nSURPRISE CHEF\n \nSurprise Chef
 ’s music is based on evoking mood\; their vivid arrangements utilize tim
 e and space to build soundscapes that invite the listener into their world
 . The quintet’s distinct sound pulls from 70s film scores\, the funkier 
 side of jazz\, and the samples that form the foundation of hip hop. They p
 ush the boundaries of instrumental soul and funk with their own approach h
 oned by countless hours in the studio\, studying the masters\, and perhaps
  most importantly\, the ‘tyranny of distance’ that dictates a unique p
 erspective to their music. Hailing from just outside of Melbourne\, Austra
 lia\, their first two albums\, All News Is Good News and Daylight Savings 
 amassed a die-hard fanbase and brought their sound from their home studio 
 to every corner of the globe. The band is now signed to Big Crown Records\
 , joining a lineage of contemporary and classic sounds that have influence
 d Surprise Chef’s music since their formation in2017. Surprise Chef is L
 achlan Stuckey on guitar\, Jethro Curtin on keys\, Carl Lindeberg on bass\
 , AndrewCongues on drums\, and Hudson Whitlock—the latest member who doe
 s it all from percussion to composing to producing. Their self proclaimed 
 “moody shades of instrumental jazz-funk” have a bit of everything: pun
 chy drums\, infectious keys\, rhythm guitar you might hear on a Studio One
  record\, and flute lines that could be from a Blue Note session. But when
  you step back and take in the entirety of their sound and approach\, you
 ’ll hear and see a group greater than the sum of its parts.\nALANNA ROYA
 LEAlanna Royale makes classic-minded R&B and soul music for the modern age
 . It’s a sound rooted in big melodies\, blasts of brass\, percussive pun
 ch\, and old-school grooves\, with songs that shine a light not only on fr

 8PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nSTUCK\n \nWorking at a mixing bo
 ard one night\, a catchphrase popped into Greg Obis’ head: “freak freq
 uency.” He was ringing out feedback during his job as a sound engineer\,
  and started to picture the parallels between acoustic physics and politic
 al trends. “If you think about a waveform\, as the frequency rises\, the
  space between the sine waves gets less and less\,” Obis explains. “Wi
 th that downward trend comes constant heightening\, stress and tension.”
  He came to see freak frequency as an apt metaphor for the decline of West
 ern empire\, an inverse relationship between the (positive) deterioration 
 of American hegemony and the (negative) worsening of daily life under that
  fall. It was a fitting title for the new material Obis was planning for S
 tuck\, the frenetic and twisted post-punk outfit he formed in 2018. Inspir
 ed by the doomy social economics of Mark Fisher’s Capitalist Realism\, t
 he bleak worldbuilding of horror games Demon’s Souls and Bloodborne\, an
 d the bombastic yet arty satire of Devo\, Obis channeled his audio analogy
  into Freak Frequency\, an album ringing out with explosive sounds and ide
 as. Though its songs tackle the violence of wealth\, the nightmares of tec
 hnocracy\, and the rise of the conspiratorial layman\, Freak Frequency is 
 Stuck’s quirkiest record to date—compositionally challenging and equip
 ped with menace\, yet dotted with vibrant fun. “Being in a brooding post
 -punk band isn’t that appealing to me\,” jokes Obis. “When things ar
 e bad\, all you can really do is laugh.”\n \n \n \nMESH\n \nPhiladelphi

 American folk–the purity of stringed instruments\, supple syncopated per
 cussion and elusive melodies that define the works of Latin American legen
 ds such as Violeta Parra\, Víctor Jara and Atahualpa Yupanqui. From the p
 ropulsive\, chant-like groove of “Guanaco” to the art-pop panache of 
 “All the Time in the World\, ”Underbelly is the kind of record that in
 vites you to quiet down and listen\, savoring every single detail.The albu
 m reaches an emotional pinnacle during its second half\, when the majestic
  lament of “Softy”– seeped in exquisite cushions of reverb–segues 
 into the hypnotic reverie of “Kerosene.” It also signals a new chapter
  in the fusion of Latin roots with mainstream rock\, anchoring its sonic q
 ueston a rare commodity: inspired songwriting.\n

 n Utah. While his career as a student would prove short-lived\, he integra
 ted into Provo and SLC’s underground music and art scene\, left religion
  behind\, and called his new band “Choir Boy”.“It seemed funny to me
  as sort of a comical reclamation of the mocking title I received from “
 punk” peers as a teen. While serving as a weird reflection of my childho
 od and musical heritage.”\n \nSince Choir Boy’s gorgeous debut LP on T
 eam Love records in 2016\, the dream-pop outfit has gained a cult followin
 g online and in underground circles.  Adam’s stunning vocal range\, lay

 bums of expertly crafted pop punk\, Remember Sports follows up last year
 ’s epic Like a Stone with the first EP of their decade-long run. Recorde
 d piece meal in their respective homes\, sometimes together\, sometimes ap
 art\, Leap Day trades the live immediacy of their studio classics for some
 thing cozier\, though no less rousing. The core trio of Carmen Perry\, Cat
 herine Dwyer\, and Jack Washburn have always kept up active home recording
  practices for their solo projects–Carmen as Addie Pray\, Catherine as S

 story\, the band opts for simple drum machine accompaniment\, lending the 
 music a fresh weightlessness even as Carmen’s arresting vocals and sharp
  lyrics bring gravity in all their righteous anger\, scathing self-reproac
 h\, and disarming tenderness. Musically\, all the thrilling guitar riffs a
 nd grooving bass lines we’ve come to expect are here\, but the gradual r
 ecording process offered the band more opportunity to explore and experime

 barrage of songs matching their frenetic sound with both self-aware outpou
 ring and incisive observation of the world around them—a dynamic that’
 s earned massive critical acclaim as well as admiration from the likes of 
 punk legend Henry Rollins. As further shown on their upcoming sophomore fu
 ll-length Taken By Force—an album the band aptly sums up as “1984 meet
 s Endless Summer”—CIVIC joyfully obliterate the line between furious c
 atharsis and unbridled fun\, introducing a vital new energy into today’s
  musical landscape.  Hailed by Stereogum as “an unholy lo-fi pile-up of
  garage rock\, punk\, and ’90s-style noise-rock\,” CIVIC inject every 
 song with a visceral urgency hinting at their shared history in the local 
 hardcore scene. As frontman Jim McCullough recalls\, the band first took s
 hape back in 2017\, when he and a friend dreamed up a musical project insp
 ired by iconic Australian punk acts like Radio Birdman and The Saints. “
 We were in a bowling alley in Japan and came up with a very strong focus f

 und but get a little more thoughtful with the melodies and songwriting\,
 ” says McCullough. Upon returning from Japan\, McCullough soon recruited
  a full lineup featuring Lewis Hodgson and bassist Roland Hlavka. Within s

  2018 release that prompted Vice to crown the band “Melbourne’s New Ki

 ke a kid: experimenting\, having fun\, and trying to discover new things a
 bout this work\,” says Pile’s Rick Maguire about All Fiction. It’s h
 is band’s eighth record\, and one that finds the ambitious group assembl
 ing its most texturally complex material yet—despite the fraught inspira
 tion underscoring its restive lyrics. Alongside the blistering drums and s
 corched-earth riffs that first galvanized Pile’s dedicated fanbase\, the
  band has incorporated elegiac strings\, mystifying vocal corrosions\, and
  haunting synths. From the creeping fear of cinematic opener “It Comes C
 loser” to the euphorically ascending keys on ego-shattering closer “Ne
 on Gray\,” All Fiction is an ornate\, carefully paced study on the subje
 ctivity of perception\, the data-shaping despotism of big tech\, and the c
 onnections between anxiety and death. In its most vital moments\, it’s a
 lso a resolute recommitment to the restorative significance of art and ima
 gination.\n \nFor fifteen years\, Pile’s evolving take on rock has earne
 d the group one oft-repeated superlative: “your favorite band’s favori
 te band.” Ceaseless touring took its members from Boston’s basement ci
 rcuit to international festivals\, hitting loftier technical apexes with e
 ach new record. Maguire—the fastidious composer\, evocative guitarist\, 
 and potent voice behind the solo-turned-punk project—gives musical body 
 to his interior world in scream-along-able lyrics that skew surreal. \n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nPANSY DIVISION\n \nThere have bee
 n gay musicians hidden throughout rock music history\, but Pansy Division 
 when began in 1991 in San Francisco\, they were the first to be so boldly 
 open about it.  Founded by guitarist/singer Jon Ginoli and soon joined by
  bassist/singer Chris Freeman\, with the intent of forming a gay rock band
 \, Pansy Division blew the closet doors open. Raised on a diet of 60s pop 
 and 70s punk\, their sound was suitably crunchy and catchy as hell. They w
 rote in-your-face lyrics\, but did it with a sense of humor. Not only did 
 their music and stance defy stereotypic norms of rock musicians being open
 ly gay\, they also broke gay cultural stereotypes that rock wouldn’t int
 erest gay people.\nTHE RITCHIE WHITE ORCHESTRA \nThe Ritchie White Orches
 tra is a hard rocking poppy psychedelic trip to Detention Hall. Music for 
 bad boys and girls and those in between.\n
