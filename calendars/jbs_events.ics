 oors8 PM – Show\nBLVCK HIPPIEMemphis\, TN’s Blvck Hippie will release 
 their new album Basketball Camp on June 14th. “I wanted to write a recor
 d that I needed to hear in high school.” shares the band’s Josh Shaw (
 they/them). With Basketball Camp\, Blvck Hippie faces down overwhelming an
 xieties and insecurities through endearingly bleary eyed indie rock\, drea
 my off kilter pop\, free jazz interludes\, and cathartic freak outs. Baske
 tball Camp is the follow up to the band’s promising debut LP If You Feel
  Alone at Parties\, which FLOOD Magazine praised as “not only a must-lis
 ten\, but a must-repeat-listen\, many times in a row\; a lo-fi\, rhythm-an
 d-blues-and-indie\, heartbreaking mini-epic about growing up and out and o
 ver while blossoming weirdly anew and expressing genuine poetic thought ev
 ery time you hear it.” Shaw approached their newest record with a freed
 om and weirdness that manifests itself in a confident genre agnostic journ
 ey that seamlessly transitions between twinkly midwest emo guitars\, early
  aughts Lower East Side indie rock\, woozy chillwave\, spoken word and jaz
 z. With songs structured more like acts in a play than your typical verse 
 / chorus / verse\, at every turn the listener comes across something delig
 htfully unexpected. And in a nod to the rich musical history of the band
 ’s hometown\, and the underappreciated present day artistic scene therei
 n\, a choir of Memphis artists contribute their voices to various songs\, 
 acting as a storytelling device tying the record’s various threads toget
 her. That Memphis chorus fittingly closes out the album in joyful reverie 
 as Shaw expounds upon an apprehensive but hopeful message to anyone listen
 ing. “I definitely haven’t made it over the mountain\, but I’ve gott
 en higher than I’ve ever been so far.”\nGROCERGrocer is a band from Ph
 iladelphia. Lead by three distinct vocalists\, each with a unique voice bo
 th on and off their respective instruments\, they flicker between moments 
 of brash chromaticism\, saccharine pop sensibility\, and rhythmic acrobati
 cs. Their compositions are both meticulous and volatile\, while their live
  performances are lauded for explosive chemistry with cheeky curiosity.\nK

  let my mind wander to the places where I could no longer go\,” he says.

  Doors9 PM – Show\n\nSLOMO SAPIENS Slomo Sapiens originated back in 201
 6 when lead guitarist & frontman Ceallaigh Manaaki moved across the planet
  from New Zealand to America. If you believe in horoscopes\, ghosts\, and 
 fairy tales\, you might think it was fate that Ceallaigh met Greg Geiger (
 bass) and Jon Pritchard (drums) within his first week in Philadelphia. The
  three piece dropped their debut EP Hot Milk in 2018 as a concise thesis o
 n Psych\, Garage\, and Sludge Rock.\nAs the band evolved\, they dug deeper
  into a psychedelic abyss and crafted their first LP Cabin Fever Dreams. T
 he aptly titled record’s release coincidentally paired with the entire w
 orld shutting down for the first time in March of 2020. With no end in sig
 ht\, the band couldn’t help but feel that fate had played a dirty trick 
 on them this time. The darkest moments on CFD highlight the horrors of iso
 lation with references to Kenneth Anger & Allister Crowley while pulling m
 usical influence from The Cramps & The 13th Floor Elevators.\nSince then\,
  the boys explored their Stoner Metal alter egos on Slömos Vol 1 in 2021 
 and joined forces with multi-instrumentalist Michael Sanzo (Dawn Drapes\, 
 XIXIX) to expand their presence in Philadelphia’s prolific and infinite 
 music scene.\nThe band has finally finished their sophomore album The Holy
  Babble and has already released the first single ‘Tongues ii’. With 
 ‘Tongues ii’\, the band unleashes their maximalist sound\, complete wi
 th a Krautrock-inspired intro\, swarming textures\, and an aphotic depth o
 f layers. It’s almost as if the psych rock monster they created has muta
 ted\, sprouted a few extra legs\, and reached a new stage of evolution. A 
 stage post-sapien.\nWAX JAW\n\n\nFLATWAVES\n \n\n

 who owe their musical bond to the power of text messages. Although the pai

 California\, the Panoramic House has recently hosted acts like My Morning

  Playing for over 25 years\, Etran has emerged as stars of the local weddi

 ying a sound that invokes the desert metropolis\, “Agadez” celebrates 
 the sounds of all the dynamism of a hometown wedding.Etran is a family ban

 hborhood of Abalane\, just in the shadow of the grand mosque. Sons of noma
 dic families that settled here in the 1970s fleeing the droughts\, they al
 l grew up in Agadez. The band was formed in 1995 when current band leader 
 Moussa “Abindi” Ibra was only 9 years old. “We only had one acoustic
  guitar\,” he explains\, “and for percussion\, we hit a calabash with 
 a sandal.” Over the decades\, the band painstakingly pieced together gea
 r to form their band and built an audience by playing everywhere\, for eve
 ryone. “It was difficult. We would walk to gigs by foot\, lugging all ou
 r equipment\, carrying a small PA and guitars on our backs\, 25 kilometers
  into the bush\, to play for free…there’s nowhere in Agadez we haven
 ’t played.”From the days of the Trans-Saharan caravan in the 14th cent

 that stands at the crossroads\, where people and ideas come together. Unde

  taken hold. Agadez’s style is the fastest\, with frenetic electric guit

 truments and recording techniques used\; feathered paper dragged across pa
 intings\, field recordings in the woods at night\, accordion\, string arra

  effort\, as all songs were written\, produced and engineered by frontpers
 on & multi-instrumentalist\, KC Abrams\, who explored themes of human conn

 ally\, Mirage on the Meadow is a psychedelic amalgamation of graveyard shi
 fting indie rock – full of the dread we all experience while retaining a

  cult favorite Japanese band\, Fishmans (active throughout the late 80’s
  and 90’s) and fell in love with their peerless mix of dream pop\, psych
 edelic rock\, trip-hop and dub/reggae. Unable to speak the Japanese langua

 o the arrangements and compositions that comprise nine Fishmans songs\, in
 cluding ambitious fan favorite\, the 30-minute plus “LONG SEASON”\, a 
 song that has never been attempted as a cover before. Abrams recalls heari

 oors9 PM – Show\nSO TOTALLYPhiladelphia’s So Totally are a portrait of
  utmost devotion. Since 2015\, the band has humbly studied their surroundi
 ngs and themselves\, perfecting a sound present on 2016’s A Cheap Close-
 Up of Heaven\, and 2019’s In The Shape Of. Shimmering guitars sit undern
 eath lush vocals that concurrently embed themselves in a listener’s subc
 onscious\, haunting them with heavy mood and nostalgia for 90’s rock gro
 ups. These releases brought So Totally to the point of singular focus on d
 rafting a third album\, Double Your Relaxation\, while in quarantine in 20
 20. Lyrically and thematically\, Double Your Relaxation explores where inf
 luence and “hypnosis” exist in life\, specifically in environment\, me
 dia\, relationships\, and self\, bouncing between perspectives of witnessi
 ng\, interacting with\, and contributing to illusion and how that ultimate
 ly affects our idea of identity. The moody and surreal nature of the songs
  lends itself appropriately to the shoegaze/heavy indie style of So Totall
 y\, making them a perfect addition to the canon of the genre. “Double Yo
 ur Relaxation” is out May 17th via Tiny Engines.\nGOLDEN APPLESGolden Ap
 ples is the musical project of Philadelphia resident Russell Edling and fr
 iends. The band combines elements of psychedelic rock\, bedroom pop\, yout
 ube tutorials\, train whistles from over the mountain\, among other things
 \, and have been compared sonically to Sparklehorse\, Stone Roses\, and Be
 ulah.\nTHE GOALIE’S ANXIETY AT THE PENTALTY KICK\nThe Goalie’s Anxiety

 The members of the band are Alyssa Resh (percussion)\, Ana Hughes Perez (v

DESCRIPTION:\n*All events are 21+ valid ID required for entry*\n8 PM – D
 oors9 PM – Show\nSHAEDSHAED weren’t immune to spinning out. The trio o
 f Chelsea Lee and twin brothers Max and Spencer Ernst had been living in a
  whirlwind for a long time — a long\, circuitous\, sometimes stop-start 
 arc that included meeting as teenagers playing around D.C.\, living and wr
 iting at home together\, and a surprise breakout hit in 2018’s “Trampo
 line.” The runaway ascension of “Trampoline” led the band through an
  array of dream scenario milestones — soundtracking a MacBook Air commer
 cial\, two billion streams\, and accolades from pop culture monoliths like
  iHeart and Billboard. But SHAED also experienced the pitfalls of followin
 g that unexpected success. Seeking a reset\, the trio emerged from tumultu
 ous times equally defined by existential crises and beautiful life changes
  to craft a sophomore album that was as true a statement of their identity
  as anything they had made thus far. There was only one name for it: Spinn
 ing Out.Spinning Out is the sound of SHAED’s core ethos\, their connecti
 on as family and musicians. Inspired by new love and parenthood\, the albu
 m cohered as a collection of snapshots and vignettes\, reflecting on belon
 ging and connection from all different angles. While aided by collaborator
 s like POWERS’ Mike Del Rio\, the bulk of Spinning Out was built on SHAE
 D\, as always\, writing and recording at home together\, chasing a more or
 ganic and lived-in atmosphere. Across moving ballads and graceful bops ali
 ke — including the emotionally bare title track\, the soaring “Rocket 
 in the Sky\,” and the hazy earworm of lead single “Everybody Knows I
 ’m High” (debuted in SHAED’s February Kimmel performance) — the ba
 nd catalogs all the trials\, euphoria\, confusion\, and hope that ran thro
 ugh a messy few years. Once upon a time Spinning Out might’ve been born 
 from fragmentation\, but it became the story of SHAED doing what they’ve
  always done best — getting in a room and chasing the answer together.\n

 are born\, Philadelphia based\, singer-songwriter\, story teller\, and pro
 ducer who is using the tools around her to capture the emotions of an era.
  Daniels’ work is as colorful\, vulnerable\, and charismatic as her pers
 onality. She thoughtfully combines elements of folk\, rock and soul altern
 atives to create personal and tender music interlaced with messages of tru
 th and positive change.\nGrowing up in the rural town of Smyrna\, Delaware
 \, Daniels had felt first-hand both the extreme joy and the major isolatio
 n that many LGBTQ+ people experience in churches. After coming out\, she
  left the church but continued her journey armed with the love of powerful
  music and celebration of community. She currently resides in the city of 
 Philadelphia continuing to create music to share and inspire those around 
 her.  After leading two successful musical projects\, Hoochi Coochi and
  FlowCity\, Sug has set out to create solo music that reflects her curren
 t views and personal stories. \nDaniels’ electric ukulele inspired musi
 c has been featured on WXPN\, NPR\, and Good Morning America on ABC. 
 After a successful release with author and singer songwriter John Faye (
 Lighting In A Bottle\, 2022) and a single release on Don Giovanni Records
  (When I’m Gone\, 2023) Daniel is back in the studio. Surrounded by an 
 encouraging and supportive musical community\, Daniels has been recording 
 an EP of the catchy and joyful music she’s been playing while on touring
  the MidWest and NorthEast regions of the country solo and with The Blac
 k Opry Revue. Daniels plans to release several singles from her forthcomin
 g collection of music and continue touring in 2024.\nJESSYE DESILVA\nJessy
 e DeSilva (she/they) seamlessly blends theatrical pop elements with tradit
 ional folk and roots music to form her piano-driven alt-americana sound. S
 he infuses hope into songs about religious alienation\, mental health stru
 ggles\, and societal injustice to create a uniquely queer and unholy rucku
 s. DeSilva’s 2023 LP “Renovations” was lauded by outlets such as No 
 Depression and Nashville Scene for its timeliness and relevance as well as
  its “range of acoustic textures..” and “striking and rich music.”
  Singles from the LP received features in The Boot. NPR Music. and Rolling
  Stone. Jessye’s latest single “Gallows Tree” is a modern roots medi
 tation on generational trauma and the things we leave unsaid. As American 
 Songwriter puts it. “Pain hangs off their lips. pushing them to greater\
 , more soaring heights.”\nMANDY VALENTINE\n\nNever taking themselves too
  seriously\, Philadelphia-based 5+ piece Mandy Valentine brings a new appr
 oach to some classic country and rock & roll themes. With galloping rhythm
 s\, close harmonies\, and lyrics like\, “I see a whippoorwill\, oh\, sta
 rt to fly and feel so lonesome\, baby\, I could cry”\, Mandy Valentine e
 vokes mid-century country icons such as Hank Williams\, Elvis Presley\, an
 d the Everly Brothers while treble-drenched guitars\, female-forward vocal
 s\, and catchy hooks recall 60s pop like The Shangri-Las and The Orlons. P
 ut together\, Mandy Valentine is “a little bit country and a little bit 
 rock n roll”.\n\n\n

 rcussionist/singer-songwriter Brijean Murphy (the percussive heartbeat for
  live bands like Mitski\, Poolside\, and Toro y Moi) and multi-instrumenta
 list/producer Doug Stuart has moved with ingenuity\, fusing psych-pop abst
 raction with dancefloor sensibilities. Through the body and mind\, rhythm 
 and lyricism\, they make sense of the worlds around and within\; 2021’s 
 Feelings celebrated self-reflection\; 2022’s Angelo processed loss\, coi
 nciding with the duo’s first headlining tour\, which doubled down on the
  material’s desire to move. Now\, across the playful expanse of Macro\, 
 arriving in 2024 on Ghostly International\, Brijean engages different side
 s of themselves\, the paradox of being alive. Murphy\, an accomplished DJ
 \, session and live player in Oakland’s diverse music scene has emerged 
 as one of indie’s most in-demand percussionists. In 2018\, she began rec
 ording songs with multi- instrumentalist and producer Stuart\, who shares 
 a background in jazz and pop in bands such as Bells Atlas\, Meernaa\, and 
 Luke Temple. Eventually dubbed Brijean\, the project grew out of marathon 
 sessions at their intimate home-studio. Their first effort\, Walkie Talkie
  (released by Native Cat Recordings in 2019)\, found Murphy taking the mic
  for the first time to deliver dreamy dance tracks that felt home-cooked a
 nd effortlessly chic. Her layered percussion and hypnotic\, expressive voc
 als coupled with Stuart’s production and harmonic palette evoked shades 
 of disco\, ‘90s house\, and a sly pop sensibility. ”A smooth\, sumptuo
 us\, and soulful record\,” said Bandcamp\, who helped propel the group
 ’s early following. Murphy’s musical talents are family heirlooms: he
 r father\, percussionist and engineer Patrick Murphy\, taught Brijean her 
 first patterns on a pair of congas that she inherited from the late Trinid
 adian steel drum legend Vince Charles (of Neil Diamond). Growing up in LA
 ’s Glassell Park\, Murphy was raised by a cadre of honorary aunts and un
 cles – a deep bench of jazz\, Latin and soul musicians in their own rite
 s. This meant she grew up regaled by musical lore – larger-than-life tal
 es of jazz luminaries\, psychedelic trips and obscure cultural enclaves 
 – sampling some of those family stories and weaving them into her work. 
 Growing up outside of Chicago\, Stuart found his way into jazz clubs and f
 estivals as a teenager\, frequently going to hear Jeff Parker\, Fred Ander
 son\, and other members of the AACM. While attending the University of Mic
 higan\, he studied under Detroit jazz royalty\, Robert Hurst and Geri Alle
 n. After college\, Stuart became intrigued by the music of J Dilla and Moo
 dymann\, and began learning production and exploring the connections betwe
 en jazz\, house\, and hip-hop.\nCOLLOBOHColloboh (a portmanteau of Collins

 oors8 PM – Show\nTHE CLIENTELEThe Clientele’s ‘I Am Not There Anymor
 e’ follows 2017’s ‘Music for the Age of Miracles’ (which arrived a
 fter a seven-year hiatus for the band)\, with new recording sessions begin
 ning in 2019 and continuing piecemeal until 2022 —in part due to the pan
 demic and also because the band wanted the space to experiment. “We’d 
 always been interested in music other than guitar music\, like for donkey
 ’s years\,” vocalist/lyricist/guitarist Alasdair MacLean says. This ti
 me out\, he — alongside bassist James Hornsey and drummer Mark Keen — 
 incorporated elements of post-bop jazz\, contemporary classical and electr
 onic music. According to MacLean\, “None of those things had been able t
 o find their way into our sound other than in the most passing way\, in th
 e faintest imprint.”This stretching out — what MacLean calls “a leap
  forwards and to the side” — can be heard clearly in “Blue Over Blue
 \,” with its percussive samples and its moments where the arrangement op
 ens up suddenly into something cinematic in scope\, with horns and strings
 . “What happened with this record was that we bought a computer\,” Mac
 Lean explains. Under the old Clientele way of recording\, a tricky song li
 ke “Blue Over Blue” might’ve eaten up all their studio time\, as the
 y worked out the time signature and the instrumentation. For ‘I Am Not T
 here Anymore\,’ though\, the trio would lay down a few tracks and then t
 ake them home to play around\, trying out different arrangements before re
 turning to the studio to finish recording all the little instrumental enha
 ncements.“Blue Over Blue” depicts MacLean’s scary adventure of being
  lost in the woods with his son\, he explains: “‘Blue Over Blue’ is 
 about getting lost in the woods on Hampstead Heath on an autumn day with m
 y two-year-old son on my shoulders—he loved it and wanted to play hide a
 nd seek. I knew he was a ticking time bomb as I had no food with me and wa
 s trying to find my way back to a path.” The accompanying video sees the
  band adorned in armor beneath beautiful and abstract artwork.Over the 32-
 year career of the pop band The Clientele\, critics and fans have often de
 scribed their songs with words like “ethereal\,” “shimmering\,” 
 “hazy\,” “pretty” and “fragile.” MacLean\, though\, has his ow
 n interpretation of the effect his music creates. “It’s that feeling o
 f not being there\,” he says. “What’s really been in all the Cliente
 le records is a sense of not actually inhabiting the moment that your body
  is in.”\n

 to throw in the towel. Llobet\, who grew up in South Florida\, learned to 
 play guitar at a very young age\, dabbling in everything from classical\, 
 blues\, classic rock\, and flamenco. They’d spent much of their early 20
 s searching for their voice as an artist and as an individual\, as well as
  for a musical community. Llobet would eventually move to Brooklyn\, but a
 fter three years of looking for a hopeful artistic breakthrough\, they spe
 nt much of their time in seclusion\, consumed by social anxiety and impost
 er syndrome—and they were considering abandoning songwriting completely.
  One day\, while commuting through Penn Station and en route to their par
 tner’s family home in Virginia (that would also lead to the crucial purc
 hase of a secondhand Tascam cassette recorder)\, they noticed Patti Smith 
 sitting alone\, waiting for a train. The typically shy Llobet decided to a
 pproach the icon\, who was\, in turn\, delighted to see that Llobet was ca
 rrying a guitar. At the end of their interaction\, Smith offered some part
 ing wisdom: “She wished me luck and said\, ‘Practice hard\, Nick.’

 of My Light\, My Destroyer is always expanding. Cassandra Jenkins’ third
  full-length cracks open the promise of reaching the edge of the new\, wit
 h a wider sonic palette than ever before — encompassing guitar-driven in
 die rock\, new age\, sophistipop\, and jazz. At the center of it all is Je
 nkins’ curiosity towards the quarks and quasars that make up her univers
 e\, as she blends field recordings with poetic lyricism that is at turns a
 llusive\, humorous\, devastating and confessional — an alchemical gestur
 e that further deepens the richness of My Light\, My Destroyer’s 13 song
 s.Jenkins suffuses My Light\, My Destroyer with an easy confidence\, which
  betrays the simple truth that the road here was not without difficulty. R
 eferring to the 2021 breakout An Overview on Phenomenal Nature as her “i
 ntended swan song\,” she explains that she was prepared to hang it up wh
 en it came to touring and releasing her own music. “I was channeling wha
 t I knew in that moment — feeling lost\,” Jenkins recalls. “When tha
 t record came out\, and people started to respond to what I had written\, 
 my plans to quit were foiled in the most unexpected\, heartening\, and gen
 erous way. Ready or not\, it reinvigorated me.”Immediately upon finishin
 g two years of touring An Overview\, Jenkins approached recording a follow
 -up\, only to find that capturing the creative spark while “running on f
 umes” was tough. “I was coming from a place of burn out and depletion\
 , and in the months following the session\, I struggled to accept that I d
 idn’t like the record I had just made. It felt uninspired\,” she confe
 sses\, “so I started over.” With her closest musical co-conspirators r
 eassembled\, and producer\, engineer\, and mixer Andrew Lappin (L’Rain\,
  Slauson Malone 1) behind the board\, Jenkins set the prior sessions aside
  and began constructing My Light\, My Destroyer from its ashes: “When we
  listened back in the control room that first day\, I could see a space on
  my record shelf start to open up\, because the songs were finding their h
 ome in real time. That spark informed the blueprint for the rest of the al
 bum\, and its completion was propelled by a newfound momentum.”\n

 themes\, fresh approach to sounds\, and collaborations (Kontravoid\, Kris 
 Baha\, Curses\, Sarin) while being the heirs of the famous Sound Of Belgiu

 “Keep Your Eyes Peeled\,” the duo gained widespread recognition\, perf
 orming concerts all around the world\, from Brussels to Los Angeles\, Las 
 Vegas\, Calgary\, Sao Paulo\, Mexico\, Bogota\, Berlin\, London\, and many

 Body Electric’ and ‘Kill Your Idols’\, all borrowing from their acti
 vities in classical arts and fashion shows\, their New Beat and EBM inspir
 ations\, and their desire to create dancing and luminous hymns about self-
 improvement\, gender equality\, fight against anxiety. Always with an incl
 usive\, powerful\, and positive spirit.In 2023\, ULTRA SUNN signed a world

  and an expansion in consciousness brought on by personal crisis\, guitari
 st and songwriter Shana Cleveland learns to embrace a changing world with 
 unconditional love on News of the Universe\, the new full-length from Cali
 fornia rock band La Luz.News of the Universe is a record born of calamity\
 , a work of dark\, beautiful psychedelia reflecting Cleveland’s experien
 ce of having her world blown apart by a breast cancer diagnosis just two y
 ears after the birth of her son. It’s also a portrait of a band in flux\
 , marking the first appearance for drummer Audrey Johnson and the final on
 es from longtime members bassist Lena Simon and keyboardist Alice Sandahl\
 , whose contributions add a bittersweet edge to a record that is both eleg
 y for an old world and cosmic road map to a strange new one.But is there a
 ny band in the world more suited to capturing the chaos of change in all i
 ts messy beauty than La Luz? Formed by Cleveland in 2012\, La Luz is belov
 ed for their ability to balance bedlam and bliss\, each new record another
  fine-tuning of the band’s mix of swaggering riffs with angelic vocals b
 orrowed from doo-wop and folk\; a band so reliably great that it makes the
  huge step forward in confidence and sheer musicality that is News of the 
 Universe all the more formidable. Cleveland\, also a writer and painter\, 
 has developed into a truly original songwriter with her own canon of haunt
 ed psychedelia that\, in recent years\, has drawn upon the changing landsc
 ape around her rural California home for inspiration\, notably on last yea
 r’s critically acclaimed solo release\, Manzanita\, a magical realist do
 cumentation of her pregnancy and early motherhood that appeared on many ye
 ar-end lists.Yet if Cleveland has spent years writing songs about ghosts\,
  what lurks in the shadows of News of the Universe is nothing less than de
 ath itself. “There are moments on this album that sound to me like the l
 ast frantic confession before an asteroid destroys the earth\,” says Cle

 efining work of art\, is a certain ineffable\, increasingly rarified quali
 ty: unity of vision. Great songs need not announce their greatness: their 
 marriage of idea with action\, soul with sound\, appears as something whic
 h is naturally effortless\, unforced—they are what they are because they
  have no choice but to be. On Playing Favorites\, Sheer Mag’s third full
  length and first with Third Man Records\, this precise\, matured clarity 
 of vision is put on full display. Over the course of the past decade\, She
 er Mag have labored to carve out a discernibly singular position within th
 e canon of contemporary rock: toggling with ease between the refined flour
 ishes of a “connoisseur’s band” and the ecstatic colloquialism of po
 pulist songwriting—yet displaying no strict loyalty to either camp—the
 ir sound\, while oft-referenced\, is unmistakably and immediately recogniz
 able as theirs alone. With Playing Favorites\, Sheer Mag have capitalized 
 on a decade’s worth of devotion to their own collective spirit—a spiri
 t refined in both the sweaty trenches of punk warehouses and the larger-th
 an-life glamour of concert halls—emerging with a dense work of gripping 
 emotions\, massive hooks\, and masterfully constructed power-pop anthems. 
 This is the record the Philadelphian rock and roll four-piece has always b
 een destined to make.\nTHE OUTSECTThe members of The Out-Sect all met whil
 e living in a Philadelphia junkyard. On weekends\, they would gather to dr
 ink beers inside a broken down 1982 GMC Caballero with a copy of Back From
  The Grave stuck in the car’s cassette player. Instantly being drawn to 
 the trashy sounds of those pimple-faced mid-60s punks\, they figured they 
 could write a song half as good as any of them. And that’s just what the
 y did! Using instruments they found in the trash\, the band has managed to
  write a handful of deranged “songs” that will leave you asking yourse
 lf “What is that smell?” and “Dear god\, can they just stop playing?

 put a premium on change. Produced by Jeff Tweedy in the Wilco Loft\, Not G
 od is a marvel of growth\, a progression from the roots of this collaborat

 lso be a fight\, holding the line until the volcano erupts. This realistic

 their shared love of pop songwriting\, control\, chaos\, and being general

  of Admittance is captured once again in the intricate tangle of the fretb
 oards\, soaring in open skies above. Like lens flare cutting through the s
 peakers\; spiderwebs cracking the windshield that holds back all the onrus
 hing reality. Blowing the dust away\, cutting a new path for cognition. As
  is always endeavored…. After 20 years of living on the road in differe
 nt places\, Six Organs of Admittance had returned home to Humboldt County 
 — a far country\, to some\, but still part o f the world through which c
 reatures of all kinds are moving through and contributing to. And some of 
 them are human. Alone together — forming connection and exchange out of 
 thought and expression — no different from the people on the other side 
 of the Redw ood Curtain. It was there\, where Six Organs had long ago emer
 ged\, in the name of everything cycling\, of circles that spiral concentri
 cally and remain unbroken\, the new music was conceived. In moments\, it 
 was as if the future had some – how wrapped around 360 degrees\; elsewhe
 re\, the systems and patterns inside the writing and recording only became
  evident later — like a recognition that cumulus and nimbus clouds which
  passed through the sky the day before contained familiar shapes. Informin

 and lyrical\, threading backward through the time of Six Organs of Admitta
 nce. Almost marinating in it as a way of life. Working on the music and th
 e vocals\, then spending some time with them while steppin g away from the
 m. Walking the dog and coming back to them. Time is Glass is made of that 
 kind of time. Alone time. Recorded in the visceral environs of home\, Tim
 e is Glass is sharply focused\, even as misty impressionist mountains floa
 t through the background. Sweet and spiny\, “ The Mission ” sings its 
 purpose\, before turning abruptly to the orchestral rumble of “ Hephaest
 us ”: rural industrial psychedelia\, ecosystem goth\, synths arcing to l
 ift a helplessly earthbound community into the firmament above. Winding al
 most imperceptibly back into song with “ Slip Away ”\, the time of the
  record becomes clear\, moves fluidly\, relaxed but aware\, from event to 
 event. People and things coming around again. The intuit\, passing through
  wormholes and time\, sounding deep then dissolving into the universal. Th
 e acoustic sounds ringing\, layered suddenly\, then clear again. Explosion
 s of a new kind of distortion. Ecstatic melodies. Communing. The space of 
 a day. The space of a season. Time is Glass\, and Six Organs of Admittanc 
 e is here and will be here\, again.\nTASHI DORJITashi Dorji  is a Bhutane
