 oors9 PM – Show\nTHE CACTUS BLOSSOMS“Hey baby\, do you wanna take a tr
 ip with me? / I’ve got a feeling there might be a silver lining all arou
 nd.” So begins One Day\, the captivating new album from critically accla
 imed Minneapolis duo The Cactus Blossoms. Written and recorded during the 
 COVID-19 pandemic\, the record explores the tension between optimism and d
 espair that’s defined much of the past few years of American life\, exam
 ining the power (or naïveté\, depending on your perspective) of positive
  thinking in the face of chaos and uncertainty. The songs here are tender 
 and timeless\, with straightforward arrangements centered around brothers 
 Jack Torrey and Page Burkum’s airtight harmonies\, and the performances 
 are warm and intimate to match\, delivered with a soulful\, ’70s-inspire
 d palette of playful Wurlitzer\, breezy guitars\, and muscular percussion.
 The Cactus Blossoms broke out nationally in 2016 with their JD McPherson-p
 roduced debut\, You’re Dreaming. Dates with Kacey Musgraves\, Jenny Lewi
 s\, and Lucius followed\, as did raves from the New York Times and NPR\, w
 ho praised “the brothers’ extraordinary singing.” The band was furth
 er catapulted into the spotlight in 2018\, when David Lynch tapped them to
  perform in the return of Twin Peaks\, and continued to build on their suc
 cess with their 2019 sophomore LP\, Easy Way\, which led Rolling Stone to 
 laud the duo’s “rock-solid\, freak of genetics harmonies.”\nERIN RAE
 Three years after the release of her critically acclaimed debut\, Putting 
 On Airs\, Nashville-raised singer-songwriter Erin Rae shares an intimate\,
  honest\, and playful version of herself through her sophomore album Light
 en Up. Produced by Jonathan Wilson\, and recorded in the musically hallowe
 d grounds of California’s Topanga Canyon\, the album represents a sonic 
 and inner shift for Rae. In it\, she embraces more of her influences\, lik
 e baroque-pop\, cosmic country\, and indie-folk songs while mirroring a mo
 re compassionate self-view she calls “accepting my humanness”.\n

 ors9PM – Show\n \nSACHIKO KANENOBU\nOften regarded as Japan’s first f
 emale singer-songwriter\, Sachiko Kanenobu created an enduring legacy with
  Misora\, a timeless classic of intricate finger-picking\, gently soaring 
 melodies\, and rustic Laurel Canyon vibes. Originally released in 1972 on 
 URC (Underground Record Club)\, one of Japan’s first independent record 
 labels\, the Haruomi Hosono-produced album remains one of the most beloved
  works to come out of Japan’s folk and rock scenes.\nBorn and raised in 
 Osaka in a large\, music-loving family\, Kanenobu picked up the guitar as 
 a teen just as the “college folk” boom swept through university campus
 es in the Kansai area in the mid-60s. The Pete Seeger and American folk-le
 aning scene didn’t appeal much to her\, however\, and instead gravitated
  towards the British sounds of Donovan and Pentangle\, teaching herself gu
 itar techniques by listening to their music. Kanenobu made her songwriting
  and recording debut as part of Himitsu Kessha Marumaru Kyodan\, whose sol
 e single was released on URC in 1969. After years of being pushed aside by
  the label in favor of newer male artists who were more “folky” in a t
 raditional sense\, it was her friendship with the groundbreaking band and 
 labelmate Happy End that ultimately helped her secure the opportunity to r
 ecord a solo album. With Hosono on board as producer\, Kanenobu spent seve
 n days recording the songs that would become Misora\, with most songs reco
 rded in a single take.\nBy the time Misora released in September 1972\, Ka
 nenobu was gone. She had left for America\, eager to start a new life with
  Paul Williams\, a music writer who had founded Crawdaddy Magazine in 1966
 . Without the artist to promote it\, “Misora was asleep for a long time\
 ,” she said. Meanwhile Kanenobu settled near Sonoma in Northern Californ
 ia\, retiring from music and concentrating on raising her two children. It
  wasn’t until Philip K. Dick\, the famed writer and family friend\, hear
 d Misora and encouraged her to get back into music\, that Kanenobu felt th
 e urge to pick up the guitar again. Soon new songs started flowing\, and D
 ick helped finance a single for Kanenobu in 1981. He was committed to prod
 ucing a full length when he died unexpectedly in 1982.\nWhile she enjoyed 
 success (especially in Germany) with her hard-hitting group Culture Shock 
 in the 1980s\, and continued to release albums in American and in Japan in
  the 1990s\, it’s Misora that keeps coming back to her. Every few years 
 a new generation of fans discover the album. Devendra Banhart\, Jim O’Ro
 urke\, Steve Gunn\, and many others continue to tout its greatness\, leadi
 ng to a critically acclaimed reissue on Light In The Attic records in 2019
 .\nIn 2023 her 1998 album “Fork In The Road” was remixed by Makoto Kub
 ota (Les Rallizes Denudes\, Sunset Gang) with new overdubs by members of m
 odern day psych-rockers Kikagaku Moyo. A vinyl pressing will be out in the
  U.S. this fall via the Temporal Drift label. In 2024 her song “Aoi Saka
 na (Blue Fish)” from Misora has been streamed nearly 2 million times\, b
 olstered by a featured appearance on the soundtrack to Wim Wenders’s Osc
 ar-nomiated film ”Perfect Days”.\n \n@\n@ (pronounced “At”) is th
 e folk-pop project of vocalist/guitarist Victoria Rose and multi-instrumen
 talist Stone Filipczak\, who owe their musical bond to the power of text m
 essages. Although the pair initially met years ago\, it wasn’t until spr
 ing 2020 when they began sending each other music between their respective
  cities — Rose based in Philadelphia and Filipczak in Baltimore.\n

 has inspired her creative practice\, she responds with a characteristic jo
 ke wrapped in an earthen warmth – “There are big hills\, three rivers\
 , and more bridges than anywhere in the whole world.” Growing up in a fa
 mily of art and music in a city with a small\, but vigorously supportive s
 cene\, Merce has been going to shows here her whole life\, even playing th
 em with the “grown up” friends of her parents – as recently as a few
  years ago\, her band was comprised of her own father and his peers in the
  Pittsburgh music community.Merce took a step back in 2020\, after releasi
 ng her last album Moonth\, to reassess during an era of anxiety and lockdo
 wn – even the reliably nourishing exercise of releasing and playing musi
 c felt precarious. “I was grappling with what kind of relationship I wan
 ted with music in my life. It was just something I’d always done\, and I
  didn’t want to lose the magic of that – but I was just having less fu
 n.” In this time of restless confusion\, she turned her gaze inwardly\, 
 down to the roots – figuratively and literally.“I got dirty and slept 
 outside most of the summer. I learned a lot about plants and farming\, jus
 t writing for myself\, and in that time I just slowly accumulated songs.
 ” A never-ending creative hunger\, supported by the community framework 
 she’d always been able to depend on\, had been newly fertilized by the w
 ide-eyed inspiration that came from plunging her hands into both the earth
 ’s soil and her own. Rooting around for an answer\, finding and turning 
 in her palms what had been buried there all along – from this rediscover
 y\, imbued with the vitality of earth’s green magic\, Watch Me Drive The
 m Dogs Wild sprouted forth.\n \nGREG FREEMAN\n“Greg Freeman deals in bi
 blical deluges\, apocalyptic fever dreams\, Floridian miscreants\, and gre
 en mountain malaise. On his excellent debut LP “I Looked Out\,” Gregs
 ’s voice takes center stage\, creaking\, crooning\, and cutting through 
 clouds of static. The songs are linked together by a palpable urgency\, wh
 ether it is the punch-in-the-face\, careening momentum of “Tower\,” th
 e country-gazing guitar squall of “Souvenir Heart\,” or the singalong 
 finale of “Palms.” Careful arrangements and production choices bring o
 ut the best of the 7-piece band that ornament the album with pedal steel\,
  horns\, eerie strings\, and tape warbles. Greg’s strong narrative songw
 riting is equally effective chronicling the demise of a 1920s ocean liner 
 as it is documenting his own interpersonal uncertainties. The sounds on th
 e record conjure up the feeling of driving around Chittenden County in the
  middle of winter\, high beams on\, slush on the floor mats. It’s hard f
 or me to imagine a more promising debut record\, and I can’t wait to see
  where this band goes next.” – Garrett Linck\n \nMARY ST MARY\nPhilad

  winding melodies that pop up unexpectedly but grab hold and don’t let g
 o… and may leave you asking “who needs hands with hooks like these?”
 The harmony-driven power-pop quartet’s new LP\, Rolodex (Sophomore LP re
 leased on Tender Loving Empire)\, was conceived beneath a stairwell in the
  band’s adopted hometown of San Francisco\, where frontman Scott Huerta 
 spent months staying up until 4 am\, obsessing over elaborate demos that w
 ould eventually become his band’s sophomore album. “I adopted the ment
 ality\, which was probably unhealthy\, that every song I wrote needed to b
 e my favorite song\,” he remembers. “I lost my mind so many times in t
 he middle of the night.” The album was self-recorded by lead guitarist 
 Mackenzie Bunch in just about every corner of the Bay Area\, and the songs
  that were eventually stitched together are hook-filled and rooted in pop.
  But they’re also layered and intricate recordings: complex vocal harmon
 ies and counter-harmonies\, Rob Mills’ inventive percussion\, Thomas’ 
 (Scott’s brother) honey-coated basslines\, and every shade of clean and 
 fuzzy guitars stacked up like an orchestra. These uncommonly majestic\, es
 oteric pop forms serve as the perfect delivery service for Huerta’s play
 ful and verbose lyrics\, which are often presented as semi-autobiographica
 l puzzles.Taken together\, the eight tracks and 24 minutes that make up Ro
 lodex are an epic statement of purpose in a decidedly taut package. One th
 at brought a band back together\, more mature and more ambitious than ever

 rist and songwriter Shana Cleveland learns to embrace a changing world wit
 h unconditional love on News of the Universe\, the new full-length from Ca
 lifornia rock band La Luz.News of the Universe is a record born of calamit
 y\, a work of dark\, beautiful psychedelia reflecting Cleveland’s experi
 ence of having her world blown apart by a breast cancer diagnosis just two
  years after the birth of her son. It’s also a portrait of a band in flu
 x\, marking the first appearance for drummer Audrey Johnson and the final 
 ones from longtime members bassist Lena Simon and keyboardist Alice Sandah
 l\, whose contributions add a bittersweet edge to a record that is both el
 egy for an old world and cosmic road map to a strange new one.But is there
  any band in the world more suited to capturing the chaos of change in all
  its messy beauty than La Luz? Formed by Cleveland in 2012\, La Luz is bel
 oved for their ability to balance bedlam and bliss\, each new record anoth
 er fine-tuning of the band’s mix of swaggering riffs with angelic vocals
  borrowed from doo-wop and folk\; a band so reliably great that it makes t
 he huge step forward in confidence and sheer musicality that is News of th
 e Universe all the more formidable. Cleveland\, also a writer and painter\
 , has developed into a truly original songwriter with her own canon of hau
 nted psychedelia that\, in recent years\, has drawn upon the changing land
 scape around her rural California home for inspiration\, notably on last y
 ear’s critically acclaimed solo release\, Manzanita\, a magical realist 
 documentation of her pregnancy and early motherhood that appeared on many 
 year-end lists.Yet if Cleveland has spent years writing songs about ghosts
 \, what lurks in the shadows of News of the Universe is nothing less than 
 death itself. “There are moments on this album that sound to me like the
  last frantic confession before an asteroid destroys the earth\,” says C
 leveland.\nMIA JOY\nMia Joy has had music in her bones her entire life. Ra
 ised in a spiritual home to Musician and Poet parents\, Mia has been singi

  such as Sade to the ethereal ambient compositions of Grouper. “I bought
  my loop pedal because it’s the same loop pedal that Liz Harris of Group
 er had. I just spent my college check on it.” Spirit Tamer\, Mia’s deb
 ut record out on Fire Talk on April 30th 2021\, draws influences from both
 : emotive synth pop (“Haha”\, “See Us”) and yearning meditative in
 terludes that trace the peripheral edges between tracks. The album title c

  aesthetically\, since their beginning\, meticulously crafting and perfect
 ing a sound that is melded together from pieces of folk\, soul\, and rock 
 n’ roll. On 13th September\, they will release their new album Divided 
 Kind. This album is the lifetime’s work of two scholars of music whose i
 ndividual backgrounds in the arts have forged a strict artistic discipline
  that exists in sharp contrast to the more traditionally laissez-faire wor
 ld of rock and popular music. Over a catalog of six albums\, Native Harro
 w have produced a discography of “rich\, engrossing records” and “in
 stant classics” while single-mindedly following their own artistic code\
 , acquiescing only to the exigence of the song: each song its own world wi
 th its own rules. Their original perspective and extraordinary songwritin
 g\, combined with a completely individual approach to crafting albums and 
 steering their career\, has garnered them coverage at Uncut\, Mojo\, The 
 Guardian\, Rolling Stone\, The Line of Best Fit\, Paste\, American Songwri
 ter\, The Bluegrass Situation\, Holler\, Rough Trade\, Telegraph\, The Eve
 ning Standard\, The Times\, Shindig\, The Sun\, and many more. They’ve 
 shared stages with the Eagles\, Robert Plant & Alison Kraus\, Beth Hart\
 , Sierra Ferrell\, The Heavy Heavy\, Courtney Marie Andrews\, The Cactus 
 Blossoms\, Great Lake Swimmers\, Esme Patterson\, and more.\nWhereas Nativ
 e Harrow’s previous records have grown increasingly more expansive\, bot
 h stylistically and in terms of the musical forces applied\, Divided Kind 
 counters this categorical unfurling with a lateral move towards the ground
 \, with both feet firmly planted\, in a folk-soul-rock sound that still ex
 plores their love of RnB\, jazz\, country\, and farther-flung inspirations
  while simultaneously digging in\, with more authority\, to the musical wo
 rld they have constructed. Or maybe they’re still searching\, and Divide
 d Kind is what’s next. Their refusal to be put in a box\, and their rele
 ntless insistence on catering to the demands of each individual song sugge
 sts the latter is likely the truth at hand.\nSAM AND LOUISE\n \n\n

 it out\, fleeing down eight flights of stairs and a “wall of grey smoke\

 Whammy\, a collection of 12 songs that pick at the fragile membrane betwee

 race Mountains’ fourth full-length album Into the Burning Blue. Decorate
 d with retro textures and violet flowers\, the album begins with the crack
 le of a fire\, as if something is burning and hatching into a new form. As
  Benton grappled with the end of an 8-year romantic relationship\, songs w
 ere pouring out of him in quick succession\, often urgently before he had 
 logically processed the emotions himself. Collectively\, the songs are im
 bued with a spectrum of weighted emotions\, but the blue continued to burn
 \, with each song adopting its respective hue — a violet reclaiming of p
 assion\, a deep sea blue of sorrow\, the sky blue moments of relief and li
 beration when he comes up for air and sees hope on the horizon. The pressu
 re of this period crystallized Benton’s adventurous spirit and self-rene
 wal as he embraced new high-fidelity sounds and conviction. Writing routin
 ely over a Roland CR-68 drum machine and enamored with the dramatic precis
 ion of 80s music\, Benton enlisted Craig Hendrix (Japanese Breakfast) to b
 ring his indie rock to immersive new heights.Out of Hendrix’s Philadelph

 efining work of art\, is a certain ineffable\, increasingly rarified quali
 ty: unity of vision. Great songs need not announce their greatness: their 
 marriage of idea with action\, soul with sound\, appears as something whic
 h is naturally effortless\, unforced—they are what they are because they
  have no choice but to be. On Playing Favorites\, Sheer Mag’s third full
  length and first with Third Man Records\, this precise\, matured clarity 
 of vision is put on full display. Over the course of the past decade\, She
 er Mag have labored to carve out a discernibly singular position within th
 e canon of contemporary rock: toggling with ease between the refined flour
 ishes of a “connoisseur’s band” and the ecstatic colloquialism of po
 pulist songwriting—yet displaying no strict loyalty to either camp—the
 ir sound\, while oft-referenced\, is unmistakably and immediately recogniz
 able as theirs alone. With Playing Favorites\, Sheer Mag have capitalized 
 on a decade’s worth of devotion to their own collective spirit—a spiri
 t refined in both the sweaty trenches of punk warehouses and the larger-th
 an-life glamour of concert halls—emerging with a dense work of gripping 
 emotions\, massive hooks\, and masterfully constructed power-pop anthems. 
 This is the record the Philadelphian rock and roll four-piece has always b
 een destined to make.\nTHE OUTSECTThe members of The Out-Sect all met whil
 e living in a Philadelphia junkyard. On weekends\, they would gather to dr
 ink beers inside a broken down 1982 GMC Caballero with a copy of Back From
  The Grave stuck in the car’s cassette player. Instantly being drawn to 
 the trashy sounds of those pimple-faced mid-60s punks\, they figured they 
 could write a song half as good as any of them. And that’s just what the
 y did! Using instruments they found in the trash\, the band has managed to
  write a handful of deranged “songs” that will leave you asking yourse
 lf “What is that smell?” and “Dear god\, can they just stop playing?

 aegu’s 90s- 00s hardcore punk/indie-rock scene before it moved to Seoul\
 , the band have vowed not to move to the capital and prefer to nurture a s
 ustainable local scene. In 2017\, MJ suffered a serious motorbike acciden

 t again\, they DIY produced their 18 track debut album “Keep Drinking”
 \, released on Damnably/Electric Muse in 2019\, followed by show stealing 
 appearances at SXSW\, TGE\, LSC\, Pentaport\, Busan International Rock Fes

 s Otoboke Beaver & Say Sue Me. In February 2020 the band toured Europe wi
 th Otoboke Beaver just ahead of the pandemic shutting down the world. So\,
  they wrote and recorded a new album and participated in several online ed
 itions of festivals. The band’s sophomore album “Marriage License” 
 was released in 2021\, receiving acclaim and making best-of lists in the l
 ikes of Spin\, Paste\, MTV\, Bandcamp\, and gained radio play from KEXP an
 d Strombo’s show on CBC in Canada. The album is a rallying cry in the fi

 ueer Culture Festival (DQCF) saw them perform\, protected by 1\,500 police
  from 450 homophobic government officials\, for equality in marriage right
 s\, and speaking out against sexual harassment and exploitation such as wh
 at occurred in the heinous Nth Room case. In 2023\, the band joined label
 mates Otoboke Beaver’s UK/Ireland shows and joined them again for their 
 2024 North American tour in February. They were live in session at KEXP st

 oors8 PM – Show\nBLITZEN TRAPPER\nThere are numbers so vast they exceed 
 the scope of human reckoning\, concepts so immeasurable they surpass our c
 apacity to understand. On their radiant new album\, 100’s of 1000’s\, 
 Millions of Billions\, Blitzen Trapper make peace with the unknowable\, su
 rrendering themselves to forces beyond their control as they explore the i
 nfinite with a broad mind and an open heart. Inspired by singer/songwrite
 r Eric Earley’s fascination with Buddhist texts and meditation (the titl
 e comes from a phrase that appears over and over in the Mahayana sutras)\,
  the album offers a captivating take on rebirth and transcendence\, and th
 e circularity of existence\, navigating its way through the space beyond d
 reams and reality\, beyond gods and mortals\, beyond life and death. The s
 ongs here are as sincere as they are surreal\, rooted in rich character st
 udies and deep reflection\, and unfolding like a riddle-filled journey tha
 t asks many questions and offers no answers. The production is intoxicatin
 g to match\, blending lo-fi intimacy and trippy psychedelia into a mesmeri
 zing swirl of analog and electronic sounds. Add it all together and the re
 sult is a gorgeous\, sprawling collection wrapped in lush layers of synthe
 sizers and washed out electric guitars–a poignant\, expansive exploratio
 n of perception and purpose that manages to look both forwards and backwar
 ds all at once. “This whole project grew out of a box of old four-track
  tapes from the ’90s that I found recently\,” Earley explains of 100
 ’s of 1000’s\, Millions of Billions. “The tapes were full of songs I
 ’d written and recorded back when I was 19 or 20 years old\, and the sou
 nd and the spirit of those recordings got me excited to start writing musi
 c again\, to go back to working the way I did when I was first starting ou
 t.”\nLOUISA STANCIOFF\n“There are times in life when you’re so prese
 nt\, so fully immersed in the moment that you can catch a glimpse of anoth
 er universe\, of a realm beyond our own\,” says Louisa Stancioff. “It 
 might last for a second or an hour\, it might come in the midst of bliss o
 r sadness\, you might be alone or with a lover\, but when it happens\, the
 re’s nothing quite like it.” When We Were Looking\, Stancioff’s stu
 nning debut\, is full of those moments. Written and recorded through a tra
 nsitional\, transient period filled with heartbreak and uncertainty\, the 
 collection is raw and unflinching\, holding nothing back in its bitterswee
 t reckonings with pain\, healing\, acceptance\, and growth. Stancioff writ
 es with a cinematic eye\, conjuring up richly detailed stagings for her em
 otionally- charged character studies sung with a silvery resonance. The so
 ngs’ guitar-and-synth-focused arrangements are immersive and nuanced to 
 match\, thanks in part to the evocative sonic landscaping of producer/keyb
 oardist Sam Kassirer (Josh Ritter\, Craig Finn)\, who proves to be an idea
 l creative foil on the record. Add it all up and you’ve got a dreamy\, n
 ostalgic\, snapshot-filled album that blurs the lines between indie stoici
 sm and folk sincerity–a lush\, cathartic work that hints at everything f
 rom Phoebe Bridgers and Arlo Parks to Big Thief and Waxahatchee as it lear
 ns to find the beauty in grief and rebirth.\n

  of Admittance is captured once again in the intricate tangle of the fretb
 oards\, soaring in open skies above. Like lens flare cutting through the s
 peakers\; spiderwebs cracking the windshield that holds back all the onrus
 hing reality. Blowing the dust away\, cutting a new path for cognition. As
  is always endeavored…. After 20 years of living on the road in differe
 nt places\, Six Organs of Admittance had returned home to Humboldt County 
 — a far country\, to some\, but still part o f the world through which c
 reatures of all kinds are moving through and contributing to. And some of 
 them are human. Alone together — forming connection and exchange out of 
 thought and expression — no different from the people on the other side 
 of the Redw ood Curtain. It was there\, where Six Organs had long ago emer
 ged\, in the name of everything cycling\, of circles that spiral concentri
 cally and remain unbroken\, the new music was conceived. In moments\, it 
 was as if the future had some – how wrapped around 360 degrees\; elsewhe
 re\, the systems and patterns inside the writing and recording only became
  evident later — like a recognition that cumulus and nimbus clouds which
  passed through the sky the day before contained familiar shapes. Informin

 m. Walking the dog and coming back to them. Time is Glass is made of that 
 kind of time. Alone time. Recorded in the visceral environs of home\, Tim
 e is Glass is sharply focused\, even as misty impressionist mountains floa
 t through the background. Sweet and spiny\, “ The Mission ” sings its 
 purpose\, before turning abruptly to the orchestral rumble of “ Hephaest
 us ”: rural industrial psychedelia\, ecosystem goth\, synths arcing to l
 ift a helplessly earthbound community into the firmament above. Winding al
 most imperceptibly back into song with “ Slip Away ”\, the time of the
  record becomes clear\, moves fluidly\, relaxed but aware\, from event to 
 event. People and things coming around again. The intuit\, passing through
  wormholes and time\, sounding deep then dissolving into the universal. Th
 e acoustic sounds ringing\, layered suddenly\, then clear again. Explosion
 s of a new kind of distortion. Ecstatic melodies. Communing. The space of 
 a day. The space of a season. Time is Glass\, and Six Organs of Admittanc 
 e is here and will be here\, again.\nTASHI DORJITashi Dorji  is a Bhutane

 oors8 PM – Show\nFUTUREBIRDS\n“I’m movin’ on\,” Daniel Womack si
 ngs during the first minute of Easy Company\, an album that finds Futurebi
 rds — once the best-kept secret of Athens\, GA’s music scene\, now a b
 eloved act on a national scale — back in the driver’s seat\, speeding 
 together toward some new horizon.Momentum. Evolution. Expansion. Those are
  important traits for a critically-acclaimed group that recently celebrate
 d its 15-year anniversary. “When you’ve been a band for as long as we 
 have\, there’s a lot of moving on\,” says Thomas Johnson. “We just k
 eep going\, because that’s how you keep things fresh. That’s how you k
 eep the spark.” By matching the sharply-written songs of three distinct 
 frontmen with a progressive mix of rock & roll\, electrified folk\, and co
 smic American roots music\, Futurebirds have built an audience that’s as
  wide as the band’s own sound. With Easy Company\, Futurebirds’ fifth 
 studio album\, that sound reaches a new peak.Featuring four songs apiece f
 rom singer/songwriters Womack\, Johnson\, and Carter King\, Easy Company f
 eels like a celebration of the tight-knit bonds that have held Futurebirds
  aloft since 2008. Back then\, the guys were college students at the Unive
 rsity of Georgia\, building a buzz around town with shows at fraternity ho
 uses and local bars. Years later\, they’ve become headliners at bucket-l
 ist venues like The Ryman and The Fillmore\, collaborating with fellow gen
 re benders like My Morning Jacket’s Carl Broemel along the way. They tea
 m up with new partners on Easy Company\, which was recorded with producer 
 Brad Cook in the border town of Tornillo\, TX. The guest list includes Wax
 ahatchee’s Katie Crutchfield\, who trades verses with King on the album
 ’s title track\, and Drive-By Truckers co-founder Patterson\, who delive
 rs a spoken-word monologue during “Soft Drugs.” A brass section even m
 akes a brief appearance. The result is a bold blend of old and new\, deliv
 ered by a band of brothers who’ve never sounded so invigorated. Easy com
 pany\, indeed.\nCOLOR GREEN\nFor the California-based quartet Color Green\
 , playing music together is all about stepping into the unknown. “When w
 e play live\, I don’t really know what’s going to happen\,” says Noa
 h Kohll\, one of the band’s two guitarists and four vocalists. “You re
 ally have no idea what you’re going to get with this band\, which keeps 
 things fresh for us and maybe makes the live experience special.” In a v
 ery short time\, they have developed a word-of-mouth reputation as a dynam
 ic and unpredictable live act\, grounding their cosmic jams in earthy melo
 dies and drawing from ’60s SoCal folk-r0ck\, ’70s classic rock\, ’80
 s underground rock\, ’90s psychedelic dance-rock\, and any other sound t
 hat catches their ears.\n

 ically Texan – unhurried\, long drives across an impossible expanse of o

 ream Jaguar\, Sun June is unmoored. The backdrop of Texas is replaced by l
 onging\, by distance\, by transience\, and a quiet fear. The only sense of
  certainty comes from the murky past. It’s a dispatch from aging\, when 
 you’re in the strange in-between of yourself: there’s a clear image of
  the person you once were and the places you inhabited\, generational curs

 um number live their sound\, weighed down by expectation or having resorte
 d to formula\, has generally ossified. It might still sound good and fans 
 will probably lap it up\, but the days of adventure and exploration are qu
 ite often long gone.Warmduscher are not most bands. Rather than closing up
  shop\, on album number five – the magical Too Cold To Hold – they are
  most determinedly opening up. Taking on board the repetitive and polyrhyt
 hmic grooves of gqom (an alluring South African take on house music)\, add
 ing in a dash of hip hop flavours and even jazz\, and then harnessing that
  to their punk-funk\, disco pogo\, it’s a spellbinding mix that results 
 in their best and most ambitious album to date. You could say they – the
  wonderful 12-legged groove machine comprised of Clams Baker Jr.\, Benjami
 n Romans Hopcraft\, Adam J. Harmer\, Marley Mackey\, Quinn Whalley\, and B
 leu Ottis Wright – were\, in fact\, just getting started.\n

 e people together forever\, whether it be a place\, a song or something yo
 u can’t quite define through words. The origins of Orions Belte stemmed 
 from one of those mystical moments in time\, which spawned a lasting creat
 ive connection. Øyvind Blomstrøm (guitar) and Chris Holm (bass) first me
 t while playing in a touring band for another Norwegian artist. During tha
 t time\, they bonded over their love for instrumental music and began talk
 ing about trying their hand at it themselves. After their work as touring 
 band ended\, they recruited drummer Kim Åge Furuhaug\, one of Holm’s lo
 ngtime friend and collaborators\, to join their new project.The three met 
 in Bergen\, located along the west coast of Norway\, to start working on i
 deas and demos. Instead\, within just a few days\, they ended up recording
  their entire first album\, Mint. From there\, the universe propelled them
  forward\, resulting in a record deal\, their live debut as a band at Norw
 ay’s biggest pop festival Øyafestivalen and the release of their debut 
 record all happening within the following year. Mint drew international in
 terest and praise from outlets including Atwood Magazine\, who called the 
 record “an eclectic fusion of disparate styles and exciting sounds that 
 says what it wants to say through memorable melodies\, ambient drones\, an
 d a stockpile of wicked guitar riffs.”\n
