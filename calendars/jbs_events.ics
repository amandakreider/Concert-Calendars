 oors8 PM – Show\n@@ (pronounced “At”) is the folk-pop project of voc
 alist/guitarist Victoria Rose and multi-instrumentalist Stone Filipczak\, 
 who owe their musical bond to the power of text messages. Although the pai
 r initially met years ago\, it wasn’t until spring 2020 when they began 
 sending each other music between their respective cities — Rose based in
  Philadelphia and Filipczak in Baltimore. A few exchanges down the line\, 
 Rose sent Filipczak an early recording of a song she’d written called 
 “Star Game” asking him to contribute drums. She didn’t anticipate wh
 at he returned to her: “I didn’t like it at first. It felt jarring to 
 hear my music so arranged\,” she says. “I almost plotted to end the co
 llaboration.” But it wasn’t long before she came around to the potenti
 al of what she and Filipczak could create together.\nTHIS IS LORELEITransf
 ormation is a funny thing. In seeking self-improvement\, we parse through 
 our inner angels and demons\, designating our better tendencies as core pa
 rts of our identity and dismissing problem areas as reflections of past se
 lves we’re bound to outgrow—as if both sides aren’t integral parts o
 f us. Personal growth can be a tricky and disingenuous prospect—often fu
 rther muddied by capitalism\, armchair psychologists and religious zealots
 —but it’s also an essential\, life-affirming process worth enduring. B
 ox for Buddy\, Box for Star\, the latest album from This Is Lorelei\, expl
 ores this conundrum\, functioning both as an earnest transformative exerci
 se and a tongue-in-cheek takedown of the illusion of transformation.\nFANT

 oors8 PM – Show\nMAPACHEIn the past\, Mapache recording sessions have be
 en pretty laid-back affairs\, with friends coming and going\, the sessions
  starting and stopping at the band’s discretion—as relaxed a process a
 s the immaculately sunny vibes that their four albums would suggest. But o
 n their dynamic and ambitious fifth album of cosmic-folk\, Swinging Stars\
 , Sam Blasucci and Clay Finch decided to take a trip and hunker down somew
 here particularly special.“It’s a pretty impactful place\,” Finch sa
 ys of the Panoramic House\, the artist retreat where Swinging Stars was re
 corded. “It’s kind of dramatic. It’s a castle-y building on a hill\,
  way up overlooking the Bay.”Located in Stinson Beach in Marin County\, 
 California\, the Panoramic House has recently hosted acts like My Morning 
 Jacket\, the War on Drugs\, and Cate Le Bon\, and was the ideal combinatio
 n of scenic beauty and self-imposed confinement to allow Mapache to settle
  in for their most cohesive album yet. “That environment yields itself t
 o a higher level of focus because everybody’s together for a week\,” s
 ays Finch\, explaining that the band stayed there during the process\, sha
 ring every bit of their time and energy on a shared vision. “We were all
  captive. No one could escape\,” he laughs.Swinging Stars\, an album of 
 calm\, second-nature swagger\, is the natural result of a band that’s ex
 isted in one form or another for its founders’ entire adult lives. Finch
  and Blasucci first met as students at La Cañada High School\, just north
  of Los Angeles\, where they both had a guitar class: “There wasn’t mu
 ch supervision or anything\,” remembers Blasucci. “It was really nice.
  And we got to just play guitars together.”\n

 , Mikaela Davis has moved away from her hometown of Rochester\, shared the
  stage with the likes of Bob Weir\, Phil Lesh\, Christian McBride\, Bon Iv
 er\, Lake Street Dive and Circles Around the Sun and entered a new decade.
  But it’s the ever-evolving relationships between her closest friends an
 d bandmates that has propelled the Hudson Valley-based artist onto her new
  album And Southern Star––a truly collaborative effort that ruminates 
 on the choices we make\, and the people we always come back to.Davis earne
 d her degree in harp performance at the Crane School of Music\, and has mo
 lded her classical music training to create an original and genre-bending 
 catalog that weaves together 60s pop-soaked melodies\, psychedelia and dri
 ving folk rock. She met her bandmates at pivotal moments in her life––
 drummer Alex Coté in childhood\, guitarist Cian McCarthy and bassist Shan
 e McCarthy in college\, and steel guitarist Kurt Johnson in her early twen
 ties. It’s the band’s collective step into adulthood that has informed
  much of And Southern Star’s thematic landscape.Navigating the periphery
  of past selves\, the coexistence of isolation and excitement in a new env
 ironment and the tension of growing away from what we thought we wanted is
  tackled with a luscious\, kaleidoscopic grace. And Southern Star picks ap
 art the reflection we used to recognise\, while trying to build a new one.
  “I finally feel like this album is more me than anything else that’s 
 been released\,” Davis says\, adding that producing the album along with
  her four bandmates allowed them to carve out their own ideas\, rather tha
 n someone else’s. Despite playing together for over a decade\, it’s th
 e first time the five-piece have appeared on a full length album together.

 e Aïr region”) welcomes you to Agadez\, the capital city of Saharan roc
 k. Playing for over 25 years\, Etran has emerged as stars of the local wed
 ding circuit. Beloved for their dynamic repertoire of hypnotic solos and s
 un schlazed melodies\, Etran stakes out a place for Agadez guitar music. P
 laying a sound that invokes the desert metropolis\, “Agadez” celebrate
 s the sounds of all the dynamism of a hometown wedding.Etran is a family b
 and composed of brothers and cousins\, all born and raised in the small ne
 ighborhood of Abalane\, just in the shadow of the grand mosque. Sons of no
 madic families that settled here in the 1970s fleeing the droughts\, they 
 all grew up in Agadez. The band was formed in 1995 when current band leade
 r Moussa “Abindi” Ibra was only 9 years old. “We only had one acoust
 ic guitar\,” he explains\, “and for percussion\, we hit a calabash wit
 h a sandal.” Over the decades\, the band painstakingly pieced together g
 ear to form their band and built an audience by playing everywhere\, for e
 veryone. “It was difficult. We would walk to gigs by foot\, lugging all 
 our equipment\, carrying a small PA and guitars on our backs\, 25 kilomete
 rs into the bush\, to play for free…there’s nowhere in Agadez we haven
 ’t played.”From the days of the Trans-Saharan caravan in the 14th cent
 ury to a modern-day stopover for Europe-bound migrants\, Agadez is a city 
 that stands at the crossroads\, where people and ideas come together. Unde
 rstandably\, it’s here where one of the most ambitious Tuareg guitar has
  taken hold. Agadez’s style is the fastest\, with frenetic electric guit
 ar solos\, staccato crash of full drum kits\, and flamboyant dancing guita
 rists. Agadez is the place where artists come to cut their teeth in a lucr
 ative and competitive winner-take-all scene. Guitar bands are an integral 
 part of the social fabric\, playing in weddings\, baptisms\, and political
  rallies\, as well as the occasional concert.\nKILYNN LUNSFORD\nKILYNN LUN

  Bridgers\, actress Hari Nef – to chop it up three times a week. Did you
  ever laugh with your friends like that?The guests of How Long Gone come f

 ghline isn’t immediately obvious. But each guest – Tavi Gevinson\, Mic
 key Drexler Faye Webster\, Bowen Yang\, and many more – are tied togethe
 r after they surrender to the bedrock charm of the show. As the unscriptab
 le rapport between Chris and Jason seeps into the guests\, conversations b
 loom and take on a life of their own. It’s an honest exchange happening.
  There is a lot of humor\, nothing is sacred. It’s revealing\, it’s in
 timate\, it’s engaging – it’s everything you want to happen in a rea
 l conversation.How Long Gone is a podcast that was created out of pandemic
  boredom by two old friends. Chris was in New York and Jason was in Los An
 geles. Most of these details remain accurate\, but what How Long Gone has 
 become is much more than it was in its infancy. They set out to make a pod
 cast and ended up creating a cosmos instead. As Chris told Vogue\, the gre
 atest reward is “creating a universe of interesting and engaging people 
 who just want to come together to have a good time.”\n

 ding through the soft solitary night\, crystalline silence of the mind\, i
 mpenetrable as an atom\, stars shining down bright\, the heavenly light su
 rrounds you completely. You are nowhere. The Lunar Sludge Band plays all n
 ight long forever and ever\, they’re always changing\, people always com
 ing and going and coming back again. But the band plays on long after we
 ’re gone.  Echo Kid is a sludge rock n’ roll duo from Philadelphia co
 mprised of multi-instrumentalists Brendan McHale and Christian Turzo. Conc
 eived through a shared love of raw\, DIY recording techniques\, light-hear
 ted lyrics\, and weirdo rock’n’roll\, the pair began writing and recor
 ding music in earnest throughout 2019 while living together in Fairmount\,
  Philadelphia.PINE BARONS – 10:00 PMThe band’s debut LP\, The Acchin B
 ook (released in 2017)\, possessed a unique quality from the auxiliary ins
 truments and recording techniques used\; feathered paper dragged across pa
 intings\, field recordings in the woods at night\, accordion\, string arra
 ngements and bowed guitars all contributing to the various moods and textu
 res of the record. Pine Barons’ follow up effort\, 2020’s Mirage on th
 e Meadow\, released during the throes of the pandemic\, was a more insular
  effort\, as all songs were written\, produced and engineered by frontpers
 on & multi-instrumentalist\, KC Abrams\, who explored themes of human conn
 ection while acknowledging impermanence and death’s inevitability. Sonic
 ally\, Mirage on the Meadow is a psychedelic amalgamation of graveyard shi
 fting indie rock – full of the dread we all experience while retaining a
  cautious optimism that propels its rich\, colorful sound towards a bright
 er future.  During the mixing process\, Abrams stumbled upon the music of
  cult favorite Japanese band\, Fishmans (active throughout the late 80’s
  and 90’s) and fell in love with their peerless mix of dream pop\, psych
 edelic rock\, trip-hop and dub/reggae. Unable to speak the Japanese langua
 ge himself\, Abrams set out to discover what the lyrics actually meant\, a
 nd with the help of a Japanese-speaking friend\, came up with lyrical Engl
 ish interpretations of the late Shinji Sato’s words. After Sato’s copy
 right successor passed along his blessing to move forward\, I LOVE FISH wa
 s officially born.  I LOVE FISH is a tribute album in the truest sense. A
 lso produced and engineered in house\, Pine Barons brings its own flavor t
 o the arrangements and compositions that comprise nine Fishmans songs\, in
 cluding ambitious fan favorite\, the 30-minute plus “LONG SEASON”\, a 
 song that has never been attempted as a cover before. Abrams recalls heari
 ng Sato’s voice for the first time\, noticing that “without even knowi
 ng what the lyrics were\, I felt such a strong connection to the voice tha
 t sang them. It confirms to me the genuine beauty of that voice and how un
 iversal music truly is.”\nTISBURYS – 9:00 PMThe Tisburys are an indie 
 rock band from Philadelphia\, PA led by singer-songwriter Tyler Asay. The 
 band has released three full-length albums\, most recently 2022’s Exile 
 On Main Street\, which combines influences of heartland rock and power pop
  hooks with jangly guitars and gritty lyrical storytelling. Their music ha
 s received praise and radio play from NPR\, Little Steven’s Underground 
 Garage\, and 88.5 WXPN\, where they played the XPoNential Music Festival. 
 They have shared the stage with national acts (Gin Blossoms\, Jenny Lewis\

  Of. Shimmering guitars sit underneath lush vocals that concurrently embed
  themselves in a listener’s subconscious\, haunting them with heavy mood
  and nostalgia for 90’s rock groups. These releases brought So Totally t
 o the point of singular focus on drafting a third album\, Double Your Rela
 xation\, while in quarantine in 2020. Lyrically and thematically\, Double 
 Your Relaxation explores where influence and “hypnosis” exist in life\
 , specifically in environment\, media\, relationships\, and self\, bouncin
 g between perspectives of witnessing\, interacting with\, and contributing
  to illusion and how that ultimately affects our idea of identity. The moo
 dy and surreal nature of the songs lends itself appropriately to the shoeg
 aze/heavy indie style of So Totally\, making them a perfect addition to th
 e canon of the genre. “Double Your Relaxation” is out May 17th via Tin
 y Engines.\nGOLDEN APPLESGolden Apples is the musical project of Philadelp

 oors9 PM – Show\nSHAEDSHAED weren’t immune to spinning out. The trio o
 f Chelsea Lee and twin brothers Max and Spencer Ernst had been living in a
  whirlwind for a long time — a long\, circuitous\, sometimes stop-start 
 arc that included meeting as teenagers playing around D.C.\, living and wr
 iting at home together\, and a surprise breakout hit in 2018’s “Trampo
 line.” The runaway ascension of “Trampoline” led the band through an
  array of dream scenario milestones — soundtracking a MacBook Air commer
 cial\, two billion streams\, and accolades from pop culture monoliths like
  iHeart and Billboard. But SHAED also experienced the pitfalls of followin
 g that unexpected success. Seeking a reset\, the trio emerged from tumultu
 ous times equally defined by existential crises and beautiful life changes
  to craft a sophomore album that was as true a statement of their identity
  as anything they had made thus far. There was only one name for it: Spinn
 ing Out.Spinning Out is the sound of SHAED’s core ethos\, their connecti
 on as family and musicians. Inspired by new love and parenthood\, the albu
 m cohered as a collection of snapshots and vignettes\, reflecting on belon
 ging and connection from all different angles. While aided by collaborator
 s like POWERS’ Mike Del Rio\, the bulk of Spinning Out was built on SHAE
 D\, as always\, writing and recording at home together\, chasing a more or
 ganic and lived-in atmosphere. Across moving ballads and graceful bops ali
 ke — including the emotionally bare title track\, the soaring “Rocket 
 in the Sky\,” and the hazy earworm of lead single “Everybody Knows I
 ’m High” (debuted in SHAED’s February Kimmel performance) — the ba
 nd catalogs all the trials\, euphoria\, confusion\, and hope that ran thro
 ugh a messy few years. Once upon a time Spinning Out might’ve been born 
 from fragmentation\, but it became the story of SHAED doing what they’ve
  always done best — getting in a room and chasing the answer together.\n

 are born\, Philadelphia based\, singer-songwriter\, story teller\, and pro
 ducer who is using the tools around her to capture the emotions of an era.
  Daniels’ work is as colorful\, vulnerable\, and charismatic as her pers
 onality. She thoughtfully combines elements of folk\, rock and soul altern
 atives to create personal and tender music interlaced with messages of tru
 th and positive change.\nGrowing up in the rural town of Smyrna\, Delaware
 \, Daniels had felt first-hand both the extreme joy and the major isolatio
 n that many LGBTQ+ people experience in churches. After coming out\, she
  left the church but continued her journey armed with the love of powerful
  music and celebration of community. She currently resides in the city of 
 Philadelphia continuing to create music to share and inspire those around 
 her.  After leading two successful musical projects\, Hoochi Coochi and
  FlowCity\, Sug has set out to create solo music that reflects her curren
 t views and personal stories. \nDaniels’ electric ukulele inspired musi
 c has been featured on WXPN\, NPR\, and Good Morning America on ABC. 
 After a successful release with author and singer songwriter John Faye (
 Lighting In A Bottle\, 2022) and a single release on Don Giovanni Records
  (When I’m Gone\, 2023) Daniel is back in the studio. Surrounded by an 
 encouraging and supportive musical community\, Daniels has been recording 
 an EP of the catchy and joyful music she’s been playing while on touring

 he infuses hope into songs about religious alienation\, mental health stru
 ggles\, and societal injustice to create a uniquely queer and unholy rucku
 s. DeSilva’s 2023 LP “Renovations” was lauded by outlets such as No 
 Depression and Nashville Scene for its timeliness and relevance as well as
  its “range of acoustic textures..” and “striking and rich music.”
  Singles from the LP received features in The Boot. NPR Music. and Rolling
  Stone. Jessye’s latest single “Gallows Tree” is a modern roots medi
 tation on generational trauma and the things we leave unsaid. As American 
 Songwriter puts it. “Pain hangs off their lips. pushing them to greater\
 , more soaring heights.”\nMANDY VALENTINE\n\nNever taking themselves too
  seriously\, Philadelphia-based 5+ piece Mandy Valentine brings a new appr
 oach to some classic country and rock & roll themes. With galloping rhythm
 s\, close harmonies\, and lyrics like\, “I see a whippoorwill\, oh\, sta

 vokes mid-century country icons such as Hank Williams\, Elvis Presley\, an

 rcussionist/singer-songwriter Brijean Murphy (the percussive heartbeat for
  live bands like Mitski\, Poolside\, and Toro y Moi) and multi-instrumenta
 list/producer Doug Stuart has moved with ingenuity\, fusing psych-pop abst
 raction with dancefloor sensibilities. Through the body and mind\, rhythm 
 and lyricism\, they make sense of the worlds around and within\; 2021’s 
 Feelings celebrated self-reflection\; 2022’s Angelo processed loss\, coi
 nciding with the duo’s first headlining tour\, which doubled down on the
  material’s desire to move. Now\, across the playful expanse of Macro\, 
 arriving in 2024 on Ghostly International\, Brijean engages different side
 s of themselves\, the paradox of being alive. Murphy\, an accomplished DJ
 \, session and live player in Oakland’s diverse music scene has emerged 
 as one of indie’s most in-demand percussionists. In 2018\, she began rec
 ording songs with multi- instrumentalist and producer Stuart\, who shares 
 a background in jazz and pop in bands such as Bells Atlas\, Meernaa\, and 
 Luke Temple. Eventually dubbed Brijean\, the project grew out of marathon 
 sessions at their intimate home-studio. Their first effort\, Walkie Talkie
  (released by Native Cat Recordings in 2019)\, found Murphy taking the mic
  for the first time to deliver dreamy dance tracks that felt home-cooked a
 nd effortlessly chic. Her layered percussion and hypnotic\, expressive voc
 als coupled with Stuart’s production and harmonic palette evoked shades 
 of disco\, ‘90s house\, and a sly pop sensibility. ”A smooth\, sumptuo
 us\, and soulful record\,” said Bandcamp\, who helped propel the group
 ’s early following. Murphy’s musical talents are family heirlooms: he
 r father\, percussionist and engineer Patrick Murphy\, taught Brijean her 
 first patterns on a pair of congas that she inherited from the late Trinid
 adian steel drum legend Vince Charles (of Neil Diamond). Growing up in LA
 ’s Glassell Park\, Murphy was raised by a cadre of honorary aunts and un
 cles – a deep bench of jazz\, Latin and soul musicians in their own rite
 s. This meant she grew up regaled by musical lore – larger-than-life tal
 es of jazz luminaries\, psychedelic trips and obscure cultural enclaves 
 – sampling some of those family stories and weaving them into her work. 
 Growing up outside of Chicago\, Stuart found his way into jazz clubs and f
 estivals as a teenager\, frequently going to hear Jeff Parker\, Fred Ander
 son\, and other members of the AACM. While attending the University of Mic
 higan\, he studied under Detroit jazz royalty\, Robert Hurst and Geri Alle
 n. After college\, Stuart became intrigued by the music of J Dilla and Moo
 dymann\, and began learning production and exploring the connections betwe
 en jazz\, house\, and hip-hop.\nCOLLOBOHColloboh (a portmanteau of Collins

 oors8 PM – Show\nTHE CLIENTELE\nThe Clientele’s ‘I Am Not There Anym
 ore’ follows 2017’s ‘Music for the Age of Miracles’ (which arrived
  after a seven-year hiatus for the band)\, with new recording sessions beg
 inning in 2019 and continuing piecemeal until 2022 —in part due to the p
 andemic and also because the band wanted the space to experiment. “We’
 d always been interested in music other than guitar music\, like for donke
 y’s years\,” vocalist/lyricist/guitarist Alasdair MacLean says. This t
 ime out\, he — alongside bassist James Hornsey and drummer Mark Keen —
  incorporated elements of post-bop jazz\, contemporary classical and elect
 ronic music. According to MacLean\, “None of those things had been able 
 to find their way into our sound other than in the most passing way\, in t
 he faintest imprint.”This stretching out — what MacLean calls “a lea
 p forwards and to the side” — can be heard clearly in “Blue Over Blu
 e\,” with its percussive samples and its moments where the arrangement o
 pens up suddenly into something cinematic in scope\, with horns and string
 s. “What happened with this record was that we bought a computer\,” Ma
 cLean explains. Under the old Clientele way of recording\, a tricky song l
 ike “Blue Over Blue” might’ve eaten up all their studio time\, as th
 ey worked out the time signature and the instrumentation. For ‘I Am Not 
 There Anymore\,’ though\, the trio would lay down a few tracks and then 
 take them home to play around\, trying out different arrangements before r
 eturning to the studio to finish recording all the little instrumental enh
 ancements.“Blue Over Blue” depicts MacLean’s scary adventure of bein
 g lost in the woods with his son\, he explains: “‘Blue Over Blue’ is
  about getting lost in the woods on Hampstead Heath on an autumn day with 
 my two-year-old son on my shoulders—he loved it and wanted to play hide 
 and seek. I knew he was a ticking time bomb as I had no food with me and w
 as trying to find my way back to a path.” The accompanying video sees th
 e band adorned in armor beneath beautiful and abstract artwork.Over the 32
 -year career of the pop band The Clientele\, critics and fans have often d
 escribed their songs with words like “ethereal\,” “shimmering\,” 
 “hazy\,” “pretty” and “fragile.” MacLean\, though\, has his ow
 n interpretation of the effect his music creates. “It’s that feeling o
 f not being there\,” he says. “What’s really been in all the Cliente
 le records is a sense of not actually inhabiting the moment that your body
  is in.”\nTHE SMASHING TIMES\nThe Smashing Times are your new favorite M

 n his first album under this new moniker\, titled BLK VINTAGE\, BLK ODYSSY
 ―born and raised in Plainfield\, NJ\, based in Austin\, TX― dives into
  his personal history as a Black musician and the world he’s grown up ar
 ound. It’s an album deeply informed by individual experiences but applie
 d to the plight of Black Americans everywhere. Even when the album chooses
  smooth vibes and laid back lyrics in favor of overt activism\, there’s 
 a philosophical bent that inspires BLK ODYSSY’s work. BLK VINTAGE is ins
 pired by a few key moments and artists. There’s the death of BLK ODYSSY
 ’s brother\, who was killed at the hands of police officers while BLK OD
 YSSY was living in New Jersey. It’s the seminal moment of BLK ODYSSY’s
  life\, the moment he was forced to become an adult and reckon with the ha
 rsh reality of being Black in America. It fuels everything he does\, espec
 ially his activism.After making a name for himself as an Americana musicia
 n\, BLK ODYSSY decided to ditch the popularity he gained in favor of creat
 ing music that would reflect his own experiences and worldview. The result
  is BLK ODYSSY\, and this first project\, BLK VINTAGE\, moves with the urg
 ency of an artist finally realizing their true sound. “I want to create 
 something that will be culturally impactful for my people. I want to do so
 mething that is impactful on a larger scale\, something that is for groups
  of Black people across the country.” There’s “1980\,” which slink
 s with the rich funk-soul of artists like Anderson .Paak and Knxwledge\, b
 ut BLK ODYSSY’s half-rapped cadence is wholly unique and utterly intoxic
 ating. The moments of levity hit equally as hard as the work refracted thr
 ough the trauma BLK ODYSSY has experienced. Still\, though\, BLK ODYSSY ha
 s the rare ability to present multiple sides of himself. “Hang Low” is
  a sultry love jam\, strutting with velvet harmonies and a bass line strai
 ght out of the Pino Palladino school of indestructible grooves.The good ti
 mes occasionally give way to introspection and remembrance\, though. The d
 eath of BLK ODYSSY’s brother makes its way into the powerful “Drinking
  Good\,” but he balances it with a desire to inspire the next generation
 . “My goal is to connect with the black youth\, and my goal is to connec
 t with my people and speak to them on a level where we can stop suffering

 e that they are delusional about Sour Widows\, the Bay Area band they star
 ted seven years ago that is just now releasing its entrancing and powerful
  debut LP\, ‘Revival of a Friend’. In those seven years\, Sinaiko and 
 Thomson each endured losses and hardships that at times required putting b

 and wonder if they should have taken them as signs—to stop\, to start ov
 er\, to succumb to the hardship.\nYOUBETNick Llobet (they/them) was ready 
 to throw in the towel. Llobet\, who grew up in South Florida\, learned to 
 play guitar at a very young age\, dabbling in everything from classical\, 
 blues\, classic rock\, and flamenco. They’d spent much of their early 20
 s searching for their voice as an artist and as an individual\, as well as
  for a musical community. Llobet would eventually move to Brooklyn\, but a
 fter three years of looking for a hopeful artistic breakthrough\, they spe
 nt much of their time in seclusion\, consumed by social anxiety and impost
 er syndrome—and they were considering abandoning songwriting completely.
  One day\, while commuting through Penn Station and en route to their par
 tner’s family home in Virginia (that would also lead to the crucial purc
 hase of a secondhand Tascam cassette recorder)\, they noticed Patti Smith 
 sitting alone\, waiting for a train. The typically shy Llobet decided to a
 pproach the icon\, who was\, in turn\, delighted to see that Llobet was ca
 rrying a guitar. At the end of their interaction\, Smith offered some part
 ing wisdom: “She wished me luck and said\, ‘Practice hard\, Nick.’

 ow have remained largely independent – musically\, professionally\, and
  aesthetically\, since their beginning\, meticulously crafting and perfect
 ing a sound that is melded together from pieces of folk\, soul\, and rock 
 n’ roll. On 13th September\, they will release their new album Divided 
 Kind. This album is the lifetime’s work of two scholars of music whose i
 ndividual backgrounds in the arts have forged a strict artistic discipline
  that exists in sharp contrast to the more traditionally laissez-faire wor
 ld of rock and popular music. Over a catalog of six albums\, Native Harro
 w have produced a discography of “rich\, engrossing records” and “in
 stant classics” while single-mindedly following their own artistic code\
 , acquiescing only to the exigence of the song: each song its own world wi
 th its own rules. Their original perspective and extraordinary songwritin
 g\, combined with a completely individual approach to crafting albums and 
 steering their career\, has garnered them coverage at Uncut\, Mojo\, The 
 Guardian\, Rolling Stone\, The Line of Best Fit\, Paste\, American Songwri
 ter\, The Bluegrass Situation\, Holler\, Rough Trade\, Telegraph\, The Eve
 ning Standard\, The Times\, Shindig\, The Sun\, and many more. They’ve 
 shared stages with the Eagles\, Robert Plant & Alison Kraus\, Beth Hart\
 , Sierra Ferrell\, The Heavy Heavy\, Courtney Marie Andrews\, The Cactus 
 Blossoms\, Great Lake Swimmers\, Esme Patterson\, and more.\nWhereas Nativ
 e Harrow’s previous records have grown increasingly more expansive\, bot
 h stylistically and in terms of the musical forces applied\, Divided Kind 
 counters this categorical unfurling with a lateral move towards the ground
 \, with both feet firmly planted\, in a folk-soul-rock sound that still ex
 plores their love of RnB\, jazz\, country\, and farther-flung inspirations
  while simultaneously digging in\, with more authority\, to the musical wo
 rld they have constructed. Or maybe they’re still searching\, and Divide
 d Kind is what’s next. Their refusal to be put in a box\, and their rele
 ntless insistence on catering to the demands of each individual song sugge
 sts the latter is likely the truth at hand.\n \n\n

 ons of modern existence and the strange infiniteness of the digital world.
  Though he incorporates the scrappy sonics of post-punk\, the gripping sen
 timentality of pop tunes\, and the spectral artifice of electronic music\,
  he blurs lines through unconventional song structures that build into tra
 nscendental climaxes. As he intentionally prints his songs down to embed f

 psing quality\, both transitory and timeless.\nFERNETTEFernette’s music 
 blends jazz\, ambient\, electronic and industrial influences into experime
 ntal pop. Led by Danyelle Taylor\, the band’s sound is both ethereal and
  grounded. With keyboardist Eli Dubois and electronic support from Rashid 
 Ahmed\, Fernette debuted in the Philly DIY scene in 2023. Fernette captiva
 tes audiences with a unique visual and sonic palette. Her songs are phanto

 llusive\, humorous\, devastating and confessional — an alchemical gestur
 e that further deepens the richness of My Light\, My Destroyer’s 13 song
 s.Jenkins suffuses My Light\, My Destroyer with an easy confidence\, which
  betrays the simple truth that the road here was not without difficulty. R
 eferring to the 2021 breakout An Overview on Phenomenal Nature as her “i
 ntended swan song\,” she explains that she was prepared to hang it up wh
 en it came to touring and releasing her own music. “I was channeling wha
 t I knew in that moment — feeling lost\,” Jenkins recalls. “When tha
 t record came out\, and people started to respond to what I had written\, 
 my plans to quit were foiled in the most unexpected\, heartening\, and gen
 erous way. Ready or not\, it reinvigorated me.”Immediately upon finishin
 g two years of touring An Overview\, Jenkins approached recording a follow
 -up\, only to find that capturing the creative spark while “running on f
 umes” was tough. “I was coming from a place of burn out and depletion\
 , and in the months following the session\, I struggled to accept that I d
 idn’t like the record I had just made. It felt uninspired\,” she confe
 sses\, “so I started over.” With her closest musical co-conspirators r
 eassembled\, and producer\, engineer\, and mixer Andrew Lappin (L’Rain\,
  Slauson Malone 1) behind the board\, Jenkins set the prior sessions aside
  and began constructing My Light\, My Destroyer from its ashes: “When we
  listened back in the control room that first day\, I could see a space on
  my record shelf start to open up\, because the songs were finding their h
 ome in real time. That spark informed the blueprint for the rest of the al
 bum\, and its completion was propelled by a newfound momentum.”\n

 ip with me? / I’ve got a feeling there might be a silver lining all arou

 imed Minneapolis duo The Cactus Blossoms. Written and recorded during the 
 COVID-19 pandemic\, the record explores the tension between optimism and d
 espair that’s defined much of the past few years of American life\, exam
 ining the power (or naïveté\, depending on your perspective) of positive
  thinking in the face of chaos and uncertainty. The songs here are tender 
 and timeless\, with straightforward arrangements centered around brothers 
 Jack Torrey and Page Burkum’s airtight harmonies\, and the performances 
 are warm and intimate to match\, delivered with a soulful\, ’70s-inspire
 d palette of playful Wurlitzer\, breezy guitars\, and muscular percussion.
 The Cactus Blossoms broke out nationally in 2016 with their JD McPherson-p
 roduced debut\, You’re Dreaming. Dates with Kacey Musgraves\, Jenny Lewi
 s\, and Lucius followed\, as did raves from the New York Times and NPR\, w
 ho praised “the brothers’ extraordinary singing.” The band was furth
 er catapulted into the spotlight in 2018\, when David Lynch tapped them to
  perform in the return of Twin Peaks\, and continued to build on their suc
 cess with their 2019 sophomore LP\, Easy Way\, which led Rolling Stone to 
 laud the duo’s “rock-solid\, freak of genetics harmonies.”\nERIN RAE

 ge is the only law.”With a credo adapted from science fiction author Oct
 avia E. Butler\, an album title from a collection of metaphysical poetry\,
  and an expansion in consciousness brought on by personal crisis\, guitari
 st and songwriter Shana Cleveland learns to embrace a changing world with 
 unconditional love on News of the Universe\, the new full-length from Cali
 fornia rock band La Luz.News of the Universe is a record born of calamity\
 , a work of dark\, beautiful psychedelia reflecting Cleveland’s experien
 ce of having her world blown apart by a breast cancer diagnosis just two y
 ears after the birth of her son. It’s also a portrait of a band in flux\
 , marking the first appearance for drummer Audrey Johnson and the final on
 es from longtime members bassist Lena Simon and keyboardist Alice Sandahl\
 , whose contributions add a bittersweet edge to a record that is both eleg
 y for an old world and cosmic road map to a strange new one.But is there a
 ny band in the world more suited to capturing the chaos of change in all i
 ts messy beauty than La Luz? Formed by Cleveland in 2012\, La Luz is belov
 ed for their ability to balance bedlam and bliss\, each new record another
  fine-tuning of the band’s mix of swaggering riffs with angelic vocals b
 orrowed from doo-wop and folk\; a band so reliably great that it makes the
  huge step forward in confidence and sheer musicality that is News of the 
 Universe all the more formidable. Cleveland\, also a writer and painter\, 
 has developed into a truly original songwriter with her own canon of haunt
 ed psychedelia that\, in recent years\, has drawn upon the changing landsc
 ape around her rural California home for inspiration\, notably on last yea
 r’s critically acclaimed solo release\, Manzanita\, a magical realist do
 cumentation of her pregnancy and early motherhood that appeared on many ye
 ar-end lists.Yet if Cleveland has spent years writing songs about ghosts\,
  what lurks in the shadows of News of the Universe is nothing less than de
 ath itself. “There are moments on this album that sound to me like the l
 ast frantic confession before an asteroid destroys the earth\,” says Cle
 veland.\n

 Spacemen 3\, that would be The Bevis Frond… and that’s not hyperbole\,
  the evidence is to be found in countless albums over 30 years of thrillin

 ieger awoke to a banging on her door. She made it out\, fleeing down eight
  flights of stairs and a “wall of grey smoke\,” which she recalls in h
 er song\, “One or the Other.” Throughout the song\, Krieger cradles gr
 atitude and conjures a universe in which she responded differently to the 
 fire. Ultimately\, she leaves us with two questions: “What do we know ab
 out living? What do we know about dying?”It was in the months following 
 the fire that Krieger wrote much of Art of the Unseen Infinity Machine\, h
 er second full-length album with Double Double Whammy\, a collection of 12
  songs that pick at the fragile membrane between life and death. Krieger
 ’s previous album\, I Keep My Feet on the Fragile Plane\, hewed more clo

 lbum as “ten songs of heady philosophical meanderings packed with emotio

 “Joni Mitchell\, Leonard Cohen\, [and] David Berman.” Krieger’s exis

  her meandering melodies have taken on a stronger sense of direction. She 
 narrates candidly and assertively\; the full-band arrangements never overp

 oors8 PM – Show\nSHEER MAGUnderlying every great record\, every career-d
 efining work of art\, is a certain ineffable\, increasingly rarified quali
 ty: unity of vision. Great songs need not announce their greatness: their 
 marriage of idea with action\, soul with sound\, appears as something whic
 h is naturally effortless\, unforced—they are what they are because they
  have no choice but to be. On Playing Favorites\, Sheer Mag’s third full
  length and first with Third Man Records\, this precise\, matured clarity 
 of vision is put on full display. Over the course of the past decade\, She
 er Mag have labored to carve out a discernibly singular position within th
 e canon of contemporary rock: toggling with ease between the refined flour
 ishes of a “connoisseur’s band” and the ecstatic colloquialism of po
 pulist songwriting—yet displaying no strict loyalty to either camp—the
 ir sound\, while oft-referenced\, is unmistakably and immediately recogniz
 able as theirs alone. With Playing Favorites\, Sheer Mag have capitalized 
 on a decade’s worth of devotion to their own collective spirit—a spiri
 t refined in both the sweaty trenches of punk warehouses and the larger-th
 an-life glamour of concert halls—emerging with a dense work of gripping 
 emotions\, massive hooks\, and masterfully constructed power-pop anthems. 
 This is the record the Philadelphian rock and roll four-piece has always b
 een destined to make.\nTHE OUTSECTThe members of The Out-Sect all met whil
 e living in a Philadelphia junkyard. On weekends\, they would gather to dr
 ink beers inside a broken down 1982 GMC Caballero with a copy of Back From
  The Grave stuck in the car’s cassette player. Instantly being drawn to 
 the trashy sounds of those pimple-faced mid-60s punks\, they figured they 
 could write a song half as good as any of them. And that’s just what the
 y did! Using instruments they found in the trash\, the band has managed to
  write a handful of deranged “songs” that will leave you asking yourse
 lf “What is that smell?” and “Dear god\, can they just stop playing?

 hing reality. Blowing the dust away\, cutting a new path for cognition. As
  is always endeavored…. After 20 years of living on the road in differe

 — a far country\, to some\, but still part o f the world through which c
 reatures of all kinds are moving through and contributing to. And some of 
 them are human. Alone together — forming connection and exchange out of 
 thought and expression — no different from the people on the other side 
 of the Redw ood Curtain. It was there\, where Six Organs had long ago emer
 ged\, in the name of everything cycling\, of circles that spiral concentri
 cally and remain unbroken\, the new music was conceived. In moments\, it 
 was as if the future had some – how wrapped around 360 degrees\; elsewhe

 kind of time. Alone time. Recorded in the visceral environs of home\, Tim

 purpose\, before turning abruptly to the orchestral rumble of “ Hephaest

 ift a helplessly earthbound community into the firmament above. Winding al
 most imperceptibly back into song with “ Slip Away ”\, the time of the
  record becomes clear\, moves fluidly\, relaxed but aware\, from event to 
 event. People and things coming around again. The intuit\, passing through
  wormholes and time\, sounding deep then dissolving into the universal. Th
 e acoustic sounds ringing\, layered suddenly\, then clear again. Explosion
 s of a new kind of distortion. Ecstatic melodies. Communing. The space of 
 a day. The space of a season. Time is Glass\, and Six Organs of Admittanc
