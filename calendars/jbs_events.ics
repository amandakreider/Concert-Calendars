 9PM – Show\nWXPN Welcomes\n \nS.G. GOODMAN\n“No one escapes the marks 
 left behind when it comes to love or the absence of it\,” says singer-so
 ngwriter S.G. Goodman\, describing the inspiration behind her sophomore al
 bum Teeth Marks. “Not only are we the ones who bear its indentations\, b
 ut we’re also the ones responsible for placing them on ourselves and oth
 ers.”   When the Kentucky native released her debut album\, Old Time F
 eeling\, she was rightly coined an “untamed rock n roll truth-teller” 
 by Rolling Stone. The roots-inflected rock n’ roll record saw Goodman le
 nding her gritty\, haunting vocals to narrate the dual perspectives of her
  upbringing as the daughter of a crop farmer\, and a queer woman coming ou
 t in a rural town.  Now with Teeth Marks\, co-produced by Drew Vandenber
 g (Faye Webster\, Drive-By Truckers\, Of Montreal) in Athens\, Georgia\, s
 he picks up the threads of Old Time Feeling. But where her critically accl
 aimed\, Jim James-produced debut zeroed in on the South\, reframing miscon
 ceptions in slough water-soaked tones\, her latest album pulses with downt
 own Velvet Underground electricity\, shifting its focus inward – though 
 never losing Goodman’s searing and universal point of view. Teeth Marks 
 is what you might get if Flannery O’Connor and Lou Reed went on a road t
 rip.  Drawing influences from the aforementioned Velvets\, as well as Pa
 vement\, Karen Dalton\, and Chad VanGaalen\, Goodman brings 11 powerful vi
 gnettes to life\, with a sound that ventures deeper into indie rock and pu
 nk territory than she ever has before. Though Teeth Marks is a love album\
 , Goodman doesn’t aim her focus on romantic relationships alone. Instead
 \, she analyzes the way love between communities\, families\, and even one
 ’s self can be influenced by trauma that lingers in the body. Teeth Mark
 s is about what love actually is\, love’s psychological and physical imp
 rint\, its light\, and its darkness. It’s a record about the love we hav
 e or don’t have for each other\, and perhaps\, more significantly\, the 
 love we have or don’t have for ourselves. \n \nLE REN \n\n

 9PM – Show\n \nPORRIDGE RADIO\n \nPorridge Radio are one of the most vit
 al new voices in alternative music\, having gone from being darlings of th
 e DIY underground to one of the UK’s most thrilling bands in the space o
 f less than a year. Their barbed wit\, lacerating intensity and potent ble
 nd of art-rock\, indie-pop and post-punk sounds like little else around\, 
 and led their 2020 album Every Bad to make the nominees list for the covet
 ed Mercury Music Prize.\n \nFor frontperson Dana Margolin\, drummer Sam Ya
 rdley\, keyboardist Georgie Stott and bassist Maddie Ryall – who met in 
 the seaside town of Brighton and formed Porridge Radio in 2014 – global 
 recognition has been a long time coming\, after years of self-releasing an
 d music booking their own tours. In those eight years\, Dana has gained a 
 reputation as one of the most magnetic band leaders around with an ability
  to “devastate you with an emotional hurricane\, then blindside you with
  a moment of bittersweet humour” (NME). \n \nBut if Every Bad establish
 ed Dana’s lemon-sharp\, heart-on-sleeve honesty\, Porridge Radio’s thi
 rd album takes that to anthemic new heights. Waterslide\, Diving Board\, L
 adder To The Sky is the sound of someone in their late twenties facing dow
 n the disappointment of love\, and life\, and figuring out how to exist in
  the world\, without claiming any answers. It’s also catchy as hell.\nSE
 AN HENRY\nSean Posila\, who records under the moniker Sean Henry\, has bee
 n writing music since he was a kid. On A Jump from the High Dive\, his sec
 ond proper full-length\, childhood and adulthood coalesce to display his m
 ost confident and animated work to date. A Jump from the High Dive is a bu
 ndle of energy through a focused lens\, each song reminiscent of the stand
 out track on a gifted mix CD. \nAfter Sean returned home to suburban Conne
 cticut in 2019 (“New York had broken up with me”)\, he adopted a “re
 ligious 9 to 5” mentality: working on the record and listening to old hi
 p-hop and ‘90s alternative CDs in his car. “I was doing a lot of couch
  surfing\, living where I grew up in a Connecticut ghost town and touring 
 around the country. I was all over the place. Amidst trying to sort things
  out\, I wanted to make my version of a pop album.”\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \nR5 Productions Presents\n \nBONNY DOON\n
  \nBonny Doon emerged in 2014\, its four members pivoting away from their 
 punk origins to create something restrained and steeped in contemplation. 
 Songwriters Bill Lennox and Bobby Colombo expanded their ongoing collabora
 tion to include drummer Jake Kmiecik and bassist Joshua Brooks. From there
  Bonny Doon took form\, developing a sound indebted as much to musical tou
 chstones like Neil Young and the Silver Jews as it was to the emotional la
 ndscapes of their always changing hometown of Detroit.\n \nThe group recor
 ded what became a self-titled 7” in the summer of 2014\, tracked by Fred
  Thomas in his living room. A tape of 4-track demos\, “Classical Days an
 d Jazzy Nights\,” followed in 2015\, before reenlisting Thomas to record
  their texturally dense debut LP\, which melded their penchant for time-ho
 nored songcraft with production heavy on tape-delay and glowing\, roomy so
 nics. The album was released on Salinas in early 2017\, as the band was al
 ready deep into work on material for a follow-up. Working in a studio for 
 the first time\, they captured a more spare and vulnerable sound and signe
 d on with Woodsist to release the resultant album\, Longwave.\nTHE GOODBY
 E PARTY\n \nOver the last eight years\, the Goodbye Party has remained a 
 hidden gem to devoted fans. The music of Michael Cantor\, the Philadelphia
 -based musician behind the project\, has been a well-kept secret that hold
 s the sacredness of loss close to the heart through classic pop ballads\, 
 atmospheric soundscapes\, cassette tape noise\, swirling guitars\, and an 
 affinity for staying present in the dark corners of our minds. On October 
 9\, 2020\, the Goodbye Party will release their sophomore album\, Beautifu
 l Motors\, on Double Double Whammy\, with which Cantor is ready to be full
 y unearthed.\n

 – Doors8PM – Show\nGINGER ROOT (9:00)\n \nGinger Root is the brainchil
 d of Cameron Lew\, who manages to not only be the figurehead of the projec
 t\, but also writes\, records\, produces\, directs\, and edits every aspec
 t of the project. While the nontraditional approach may have lead to a mor
 e gradual growth of the project it has resulted in Ginger Root gaining a d
 evoted fanbase.\n \nAfter releasing their sophomore album\, Rikki\, in 202
 0 with much of it feeling lost to the moments of that year Lew decided to 
 take a step back and try to write a succinct project to try and keep liste
 ners engaged for as long as possible. The result of this redirection of en
 ergy was paired with a newfound influence from Japanese art and culture af
 ter Lew immersed himself while learning to speak the language. All of this
  was packaged and delivered on City Slicker in 2021. \n \nWith this batch
  of songs Ginger Root finally saw his hard work pay off in a major way. Th
 e project connected with a massive audience on the internet\, and resulted
  in songs like Juban District and Loretta exploding. Ginger Root’s inter
 net presence grew steadily as well with his youtube amassing 160\,000 subs
 cribers and his Spotify nearly hitting 1 million monthly listeners. \n \n
 The path to success did not come overnight\, but rather at a gradual pace.
  The project delivered it’s first album in collaboration with Acrophase 
 Record\, Mahjong Room\, in 2018 and really has not stopped since. Between 
 each project Ginger Root has played alongside tons of modern Indie standou
 ts like Khruangbin\, Durand Jones\, Omar Apollo\, The Marias\, and Hippo C
 ampus to name a few. \n \nNow Ginger Root sets out to deliver a complimen
 tary EP and continue to captivate fans with his rich visuals and lush soun
 ds that he seemingly never fails to deliver. The project at times feels mo
 re aptly consumed on VHS rather than vinyl. Nisemono arrives in September 
 of 2022 along with their first headline tour in America.\nKING PARI (8:00)
 \n \nKing Pari is an almost accidental project. Cameron Kinghorn and DJ St
 epmom (Joe Christensen) didn’t even set out to start a band. When Joe te
 xted Cameron some jams whipped up on his tape machine\, Cameron hit him ba
 ck with\, “What is this? I want in.” Ten minutes before they first met
  up\, Joe built the loop for their first single\, ‘Sunshine\,’ which t
 hey then wrote on the spot in a flurry of collective inspiration. Now the 
 duo’s collection of work has grown\, amassing millions of streams\, radi
 o play\, shows across the US\, and a fan base growing rapidly.\nKing Pari 
 is much more than this serendipitous start though. The project is the culm
 ination of Joe and Cameron’s years of hard work in the Minneapolis scene
 . Their musical talents afforded them opportunities few have experienced\,
  from being invited to play shows at Prince’s Paisley Park by Prince him
 self to performing with Prince’s band New Power Generation. The two draw
  inspiration from the “no limits” nature of the Minneapolis sound\, pu
 shing it forward as they see it today.\n

 this noisemaker do something different?'”\nMMEADOWS\nLongtime collaborat

 nd the door they used to call home\; with the shadows of lovers-turned-to-
 friends and the overwhelming cacophony of abrupt change. They’re drawing
  a map but the port of call is cloudy and indistinct. It’s while traveli
 ng along these nebulous contours that their latest album The Sun Still See

 l swells and poignantly-rich harmonies. \n \nWhat started as a simple voc

 renching heartbreak. Two years into writing the record\, The Sun Still See
 ms To Move morphed into a texturally diverse and palatial sonic universe\,
  mimicking the immeasurable scope of ever-changing circumstance\, while st
 ill providing an anchor among the waves. “At a certain point I was like\

 9PM – Show\nPINE BARONS\nThe band’s debut LP\, The Acchin Book (releas
 ed in 2017)\, possessed a unique quality from the auxiliary instruments an
 d recording techniques used\; feathered paper dragged across paintings\, f
 ield recordings in the woods at night\, accordion\, string arrangements an
 d bowed guitars all contributing to the various moods and textures of the 
 record.  \nPine Barons’ follow up effort\, 2020’s Mirage on the Meado
 w\, released during the throes of the pandemic\, was a more insular effort
 \, as all songs were written\, produced and engineered by frontman & multi
 -instrumentalist\, Keith Abrams\, who explored themes of human connection 
 while acknowledging impermanence and death’s inevitability. Sonically\, 
 Mirage on the Meadow is a psychedelic amalgamation of graveyard shifting i
 ndie rock – full of the dread we all experience while retaining a cautio
 us optimism that propels its rich\, colorful sound towards a brighter futu
 re.  \nDuring the mixing process\, Abrams stumbled upon the music of cult
  favorite Japanese band\, Fishmans (active throughout the late 80’s and 
 90’s) and fell in love with their peerless mix of dream pop\, psychedeli
 c rock\, trip-hop and dub/reggae. Unable to speak the Japanese language hi
 mself\, Abrams set out to discover what the lyrics actually meant\, and wi
 th the help of a Japanese-speaking friend\, came up with lyrical English i
 nterpretations of the late Shinji Sato’s words. After Sato’s copyright
  successor passed along their blessing to move forward\, I LOVE FISH was o
 fficially born.  \nI LOVE FISH is a tribute album in the truest sense. Al
 so produced and engineered in house\, Pine Barons brings its own flavor to
  the arrangements and compositions that comprise nine Fishmans songs\, inc
 luding ambitious fan favorite\, the 30-minute plus “LONG SEASON”. Abra
 ms recalls hearing Sato’s voice for the first time\, noticing that “wi
 thout even knowing what the lyrics were\, I felt such a strong connection 
 to the voice that sang them. It confirms to me the genuine beauty of that 
 voice and how universal music truly is.”\nMAVIS THE DOGPhiladelphia\, PA

 t release\, Bye Bye\, is above all else a document. Their debut on UK labe
 l Permanent Creeps depicts how the punk sextet weathered the storm at the 
 start of the pandemic. While many bands broke up or shacked up in the fall
 out of the pandemic\, Blood made the decision to double down and move into
  a compound together before relocating as a unit to Philadelphia. As the m
 onths in quarantine progressed\, the band house quickly evolved from a pra
 ctice space into an intentional community centered around group mental hea
 lth meetings\, family meals\, and working on music. With no shows or any f
 uture at all on the horizon\, the band also put their heads down and took 
 to home recording for the first time. All three offerings on “Bye Bye”
  have a sense of the band’s newfound closeness and the strangeness that 
 can only come from a group of people who have willingly siloed themselves 
 off. The collage of deviating styles and pretty mistakes brought up in the

 Formed in New Brunswick\, NJ in 2005\, Screaming Females is Marissa Patern
 oster (guitar\, vox)\, Mike Abbate (bass)\, and Jarrett Dougherty (drums).
  Over six albums and more than a decade of music making\, the band has rem
 ained deeply individual and steadfastly DIY. They have also grown into one
  of the most dynamic and devastating touring bands going today.\nOut Febru
 ary 23rd\, All At Once is the trio’s most expansive and imaginative work
 s to date–a double LP that swings between surreal miniatures and solo-he
 avy sprawl. Concision takes a backseat to experimentation\, with arrangeme
 nts meant to evoke the energy and spontaneity of their live shows. It’s 
 music built across a timeline that’s longer than our internet-enhanced m
 oment typically tolerates and a testament to the band’s dedication and p
 erseverance.\nGHÖSH\n \nGhösh is a disco cabal\, a “political party”
  if you dig what we’re saying\, a band– they’re a wild sonic collage
 \, a quasi post-grunge\, post-industrial mash-up\, all wrapped up in the c
 haos and entropic funk of a warped and screwed Public Enemy demo tape and 
 a fax machine shredded in a Cuisinart. Their songs are an iridescent kind 
 of noisy digital alchemy layered in dense charging breakbeats and splatter
 ed in raucous dayglo\, laser-beamed transmissions from the future at the l
 ast protest march of the revolution. \nSymphony Spell (vocals/lyrics) and
  Zachary Fairbrother (various instruments/samplers)\, the two cyborgs that
  form Ghösh\, bonded over their love for jungle\, techno\, rap and nu met
 al to create songs that bang in tantric visions of sight and sound. Their 
 aesthetic is ripped from the screenshots of Republican nightmares and proj
 ected wide in shimmering hologram\, scored by the last dancefloor clearing
  sound blasts from a party on Cybertron\, all couched in the lyrical inten
 sity of a 2008 myspace page co-owned by Audre Lorde and Missy Elliot.\nTHE
  IREThe Ire is a post-punk group originating in Philadelphia\, started by
  guitarist Florence Lin in late 2017. Joined by Ashley Tini (drums)\, Maya
  Brooks (vocals)\, and Daniel Cox (bass)\, The Ire released their demo in
  early 2019\, and have since impressed audiences across the country with t
 heir romantic mixture of rage and passion\; packaged in the nostalgia of a
 n 80s goth and anarcho-punk sound. \n \n \n \nThe release of their debut 
 LP “What Dreams May Come” (June 6th on Play Alone Records) provides a 
 bridge from the early demos into a clear maturation of style and content\,
  as themes such as racial struggle\, societal collapse are echoed from ear
 ly recordings as well as more personal responses to the weight of our curr
 ent world. All coming together under a rallying cry of resistance that res
 onates defiantly with each track.\n\n\n\n\n

 were the biggest rock band in Zambia in the 1970s and spearheaded a new ge

  to Black Sabbath and James Brown and mixing them with traditional African
  rhythms and bush village songs. At t the peak of their popularity\, the b
 and often needed police to keep fans at bay while their lead singer Jagari
  – whose name is an Africanisation of Mick Jagger’s – riled up crowd
 s by stage diving from balconies and dancing manically as the WITCH’s bl
 end of psychedelic rock and African rhythms permeated the surrounding atmo
 sphere.\n \nJagari is the charismatic sole surviving original member of th
 e band. As Zambia’s economy stagnated and the country buckled under the 
 AIDS crisis\, WITCH fell apart. Jagari retreated to a life of quasi-anonym
 ity as a university music professor before being wrongfully arrested durin
 g Zambia’s toughest hour. Now a man in his 60s\, he spends his time mini
 ng gemstones hoping to strike it rich\, until very recently the band being
  just a nostalgic memory of his youth.\n \nLargely unknown outside of thei
 r home country\, WITCH finally got the exposure they deserved when Now Aga
 in Records reissued their entire discography in 2012. This allowed Jagari 
 to play outside Africa for the first time and for a new generation of fans
  to discover his music. In 2016 he began a collaboration with Dutch musici
 ans Jacco Gardner and Nic Mauskoviç\, and together with them\, in Septemb
 er 2017 WITCH headed out on its extremely successful first-ever European T

 track experiments quickly took on a life of their own as Pedrum began dist
 illing his musical and lyrical inspirations into something both timeless a
 nd new. His miniature menagerie of light-psych and proto-punk gems had out
 grown their cassette cage and were now ready to be heard.\nPAINT’s epony

 d. It was praised for its originality and drew favorable comparisons to th
 e likes of Kevin Ayers\, Lou Reed and Julian Cope. The mess was the messag

  not notice.”\n \nThe Ballroom Thieves’ fourth album\, Clouds\, is a 
 song cycle born of mixed experiences and fueled by the power of imaginatio
 n. The album is a lush meditation on longing to return to touring – to
  see different sunsets and cities. But\, it’s also a reflection of its d
 ifficulties\, e.g.\, insomnia brought on by sleeping in different hotel ro
 oms every night. After a major car accident and the departure of a band me

 \nDES DEMONAS (8:00 PM)\n \n“The South will never rise again\,” Jacky 
 Cougar Abok intones in a manner that suggests he is looking straight into 
 your eyeballs while singing the opening track on Des Demonas’ debut LP o
 n In The Red Records. His hand may be around your neck as well! Sounding l
 ike The Last Poets acid tripping to 60’s Sunset Strip\, Des Demonas drag
  you on a wild ride of fuzzy guitars and swirling Farfisa organ while the 
 bass and drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain. And that’s just the 
 first song!\n \nDes Demonas hail from Washington D.C.\, and have been deni
 zens of the byways and highways of the city’s musical underground for ye
 ars. Jacky Cougar Abok is the six-foot-five-inch tall Kenyan punk singer w
 ho has drummed with Thee Lolitas and Foul Swoops. Guitarist Mark Cisneros 
 has bent strings with Kid Congo & The Pink Monkey Birds\, Deathfix\, and M
 edications and pounded the traps for The Make-Up and Benjy Ferree\, the la
 tter alongside organist Paul Vivari. Joe Halladay (Citygoats) on bass and 
 Ryan Hicks (Suns Of Guns) on drums round out this squared circle of sight 
 and sound.\n \nThe songs on Des Demonas range from Nuggets-style snottines
 s on “Tuff Turf”\, to the brash warnings of “Liez” (‘Lies… onl
 y seem to matter if you never wise up’)\, to the stomper “Psychedelic 
 Soldier” and cool psycho creeper “Say You Tried”\, to the hard boile
 d 70’s punk of Swahili-sung “ Golden Eggs”. When Abok sings “There
  are no vampires in Africa\,” it may be a warning. It may be a fact. Or 
 it may be a whole lot of unrelenting scuzzy fun. Dig the Des Demonas. Play
  it loud. Twist your wig.\n– Kid Congo Powers\nNORMAN WESTBERG (SWANS)\n
 Performing throughout the night\nBest known for his work with the seminal 
 outfit\, SWANS\, Westberg’s output beyond that group is sprawling and re
 stless. His name recurs and ripples through many interconnected micro-hist
 ories surrounding New York City’s music and art scenes. From appearances
  in film works associated with the Cinema Of Transgression\, through to hi
 s participation in bands such as The Heroin Sheiks and Five Dollar Priest\
 , Westberg’s name is woven deeply in to the fabric of NY\, over the past
  three decades.\n

 (Big Thief) & Mt. Davidson (Twain):\n \nHave you ever…\n \n…faced an i
 mpossible question\, to be answered at once by a kaleidoscope of wind\, di
 ffusing your bewilderment into thousands of spinning bulbs?\n \n…awoken 
 to hear the person sleeping beside you speaking a language they do not spe
 ak in their waking life? …felt your legs possessed\, to throw you acro
 ss the room in shapes? …lost your heart\, only to find it on the bank 
 of a cold spring\, in the hands of a filling station attendant\, or in the
  dust swimming through the light of your bedroom window?\n \n Have you e
 ver listened to Twain?\n \n“A lonely day\, I went outside to smoke awhil
 e\,and think about a picture in a book:He was laying in the grass in his s
 uit\,as the angler posed in pursuit of the fish”\n \n For the past dec
 ade or so\, Mt. Davidson has cultivated his songs and sounds\, attempting 
 to create a bridge\, a meeting place\, between the terrestrial and the mys
 tic.  He is a ponderous and delicate sort of creature\, short and vaguely
  leonine\, who has spent most of his young life abiding in the midlands of
  transcendence.\n \n“Oh to be there\, the smell of her hair\,the deer sw
 imming through the watery woods\,life won’t last long for those who hate
  it\,for those who love it\, it lingers on like a dream”\n \n Followin
 g its quiet self-release in 2014\, his fifth and most recent LP\, Life Lab
 ors in the Choir\, has steadily gained devoted listeners throughout the gl
 obe and continues to blossom today. The album describes a marked evolution
  in an alluring yet strange and hesitant discography. Progressing from the
  bashfully childlike sounds of 2005’s Madeline\, (now lost)\, through se
 lf-constructed garage multi-track tangles of Sleeping Tree (2007) and Alma
 nack (2008)\, we hear the progress of a young man struggling to free himse
 lf from the shackles of depression and neurosis. In 2010’s Love is All A
 round\, a distinct breakthrough can be felt in the form of a question that
  challenges the foundation of the doubt and fear running through the early
  music. This sudden evolution is in no small part owing to the addition of
  two musicians – Peter Pezzimenti (drums and vibes) and Ken Woodward (ba
 sses) – and a sound engineer – Adrian Olsen. The music really began to
  breathe. \n \n “Free’d from doubt\, my cigarette went out\,the sun
  came out and warmed up the house\,oh to be fainting into that painting\,a
 s I wrap up the tune and bring it to you”\n \nThis fall\, Twain will rel
 ease a new record of songs – Rare Feeling – on Keeled Scales Records (
 Austin\, TX). These recordings have been gently fermenting for an extended
  period of time\, and are now ready for consumption. The foundation of the
  record was captured in a tool shed by the great magi-bard\, S. McMicken (
 Dr. Dog)\, using ancient and secret methods of time distortion. The result
 ant reels were then brought to Richmond VA\, where master engineer and sou
 nd-seeker Adrian Olsen guided the songs into completion. As with the previ
 ous LP\, the band has labored to present a purely AAA analog disc\, and is
  eager for you to experience the special magnetic warmth that results from
  the process.  (We once again are indebted to the mysterious and mighty P
 aul Gold of Salt Mastering for his kind attention).\n \nIf you would like 
 to hear some music\, please head over to twain.band.\n \n(Lyrics from “F
 reed from Doubt”\, from Rare Feeling)\n

 s of working. Young Jesus’ new album Shepherd Head is a dramatic departu
 re for the band\, delving deeper into the themes that have always fascinat
 ed Rossiter—love\, heartbreak\, God—approached in a completely new dir
 ection. It’s a record of growth and exploration\, pushing forward into t
 he future with hope while still holding the pain and regrets of the past\,
  seeking a balance for the present.\n \nYoung Jesus began when John Rossit
 er dropped out of college after doing acid with two of his high school fri
 ends and decided to join their band. After several albums\, he moved to L.
 A. with the intention of never playing music again. However\, the new envi
 ronment woke something up in Rossiter\, and he began to write music at a f
 urious pace\, recruiting a new band to explore this new evolution in sound
 . That time for Young Jesus was marked by experimentation and improvisatio
 n\, as the band toured and put out three records with Saddle Creek.\n \nA 
 few years later\, the band had drifted apart from too much time on the roa
 d\, and Rossiter became restless. After the tragic death of a close friend
 \, Rossiter felt a need for change. “I can be kind of a perfectionist an
 d a pretty intense band member\,” says Rossiter. “I drove the band rea
 lly hard for a while\, and I don’t think I realized how hard I was doing
  that. Everyone was just burnt out on me and on each other. And I think I 
 had wanted to reflect on that more\, why I did push so hard and why I coul
 d be so demanding and stubborn.”\n \n \n

  PM)\n \nWhen asked to describe himself\, Whitmer Thomas—comic\, musicia
 n\, skateboarder\, infamous Blink182 stan—will tell you\, “I’m alway
 s gonna be the one whose mom called him ‘the Golden One\,’ right befor
 e she died.” This is where his debut HBO comedy special\, The Golden One
 \, finds Whitmer: age thirty\, investigating this sense (curse?) of destin
 y-as-identity. It’s been thirteen years since he left Alabama for LA\, b
 ecoming a linchpin for LA’s young\, independent comedy scene with Power 
 Violence\, the monthly show he hosted with friends. But he became haunted 
 by the question: had he already peaked\, just like his mom\, singer in a l
 ocal band with big ambitions that never made it out of the Flora-Bama Loun
 ge in Gulf Shores? Rather than shy away from all that messy self-mythology
 \, Whitmer tapped the source of it all through writing this one-man show f
 eaturing his own original music. Songs from The Golden One\, a companion a
 lbum of songs from the special\, features Whitmer’s darkwave bangers\, s
 ynthesizing relatable-content: millennial anxieties\, therapy-speak jokes\
 , and the annals of his own childhood tragedies.\n \nAL MENNE (9:00 PM)\n 
 \nAl Menne has a voice unlike any other. Soft and emotional with lyrical i
 ntimacy that callsback to Transatlanticism-era Death Cab for Cutie\, fitti
 ng as they both share the samePacific Northwest roots. Now based in Los An
 geles by way of Seattle\, Al has spent thelast eight years as the lead sin
 ger of Indie-Rock band Great Grandpa. In-betweenresponsibilities with Grea
 t Grandpa Al stayed busy\, they’re a frequent collaborator onfriends and
  peers projects\, writing and featuring with Christian Lee Hutson (ANTI-)\
 ,illuminati hotties (Snack Shack Tracks/Hopeless Records)\, and Whitmer Th
 omas(Hardly Art). They’re also a touring member of Christian’s band fo
 r headline tours andsupporting slots with Bright Eyes. On top of all of th
 e collaboration\, Al has brought peersin to help with their own solo proje
 ct recording with luminaries like Christian Lee Hutson\n \nand Melina Dute
 rte (Jay Som)\, on new music that will become their upcoming debut-album. 
 Whether intentional or not\, their ability to expand and grow is something
  some\n \ncould only hope to achieve in their lifetime\, building the most
  beautifully heartbreakingmusic with people who mean more to them than any
 one.\n

 she knows how first impressions tend to go—“sweet\, polite\, very quie

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nLAZY EYES\n \nSongBook\, the debu
 t album by Sydney four-piece The Lazy Eyes\, is a world unto itself\, and 
 like every good fantasy world\, it abides by its own logic. Step inside: t
 he colours are a little brighter\; things move a little slower\, but they
 ’re liable to get inordinately faster in the blink of an eye. The landsc
 ape is all hard brick and plasterdust — stoner lurch and Sabbath-y chug 
 — until a hook bursts forth\, unexpected\, like a flower from concrete. 
 Suddenly you’re in a garden in full blossom\, and you didn’t even noti
 ce\; you walked a mile without taking a single step. SongBook is strange
  like that — all journey and all destination\, a decidedly modern marvel
  of psych-rock that’s unpretentious in construction but precious where i
 t counts. In SongBook’s earliest moments\, The Lazy Eyes welcome you to
  their technicolour\, sun-baked universe with open arms: “Can I show you
  all the places you can go\, on this island that I know? All the caves and
  allthe snow\, on the mountains there are goats.”\n \nThe floral brightn
 ess of The Lazy Eyes’ music belies their perfectly mundane origins. Harv
 ey Geraghty\, Itay Shachar and Noah Martin met in their early years at Syd
 ney’s Newtown High School of the Performing Arts. Bonding over a love of
  psych rock\, they banded together as a matter of both taste and necessity
 \, three of the only rhythm section musicians in a school filled largely w
 ith string\, brass and woodwind musicians. They became fast friends\, star
 ted jamming together\, and\, eventually\, began to busk around Sydney\, th
 eir burgeoning band (and friendship) being bound together by long hours pl
 aying and carting their instruments around the city. Around 2015\, as they
  began playing real gigs\, The Lazy Eyes decided to formalise the band as 
 a unit\, a decision that coincided neatly with their meeting of Leon Karag
 ic\, who provided much-needed bass to their ensemble and\, with his knowle
 dge of niche and underground music\, broadened the band’s stylistic and 
 ideological palette. “The biggest thing was that we were close friends f
 irst\, and then the bonus on top of that was that we had the same taste in
  music\, and felt really not weird or awkward about making music together\
 ,” recalls Itay. “We didn’t feel like we had to act a certain way ar
 ound each other\,” says Noah\, “We could just be ourselves\, and—”
  adds Harvey: “Freaky.”\n \nThe intimacy of The Lazy Eyes’ friendshi
 p is felt\, deeply\, in their music\, particularly in their renowned live 
 sets. In the years since they formed\, The Lazy Eyes have become emblemati
 c torchbearers for the Australian psych-rock scene\, accepting the baton f
 rom the iconic bands that first inspired their formation. Off the back of 
 their first two EPs\, released in 2020 and 2021\, The Lazy Eyes have sold 
 out numerous shows along Australia’s east coast\, including their own mu
 sic festival\, Lazyfest\; garnered praise from tastemaking outlets at home
  and abroad\, including Complex\, KCRW\, FBi Radio\, triple j Unearthed\, 
 BBC 6 Music and Radio 1\, and Spin\; been named an NME 100 band for 2021\;
  and more. The band’s reputation continues to grow\, despite the fact th
 at planned international jaunts at SXSW and The Great Escape were cancelle
 d in light of the Covid-19 pandemic\, a disappointing false start that non
 etheless proves the strength of the band’s self-recorded EPs.\n

  – Show\nTY SEGALL (Solo Acoustic)\nThe man in the tree has a guitar\, h
 e’s gonna sing. But the sun shining through the branches— are those ra
 ys yellow or hazy gray? What day is today? When are you not going to feel 
 this way again?\n“Hello\, Hi”: welcome in to a new room to play the st
 yles and feels that lie under Ty Segall’s fingers\, easing fresh air int
 o acoustic space with an assortment of love songs flowering in righteous u
 nconsciousness. Plaintive and wistful\, but unafraid. Like rain washing aw
 ay yesterday\, “Hello\, Hi” pushes open the door\, inviting the new to
  pass through all the old shades and degrees of hot and cold. Dark paths t
 urn off abruptly into absurd darkness\, then wind back through the broken 
 rocks\, ecstatic again. Absurdity again. It happens everyday.\n“Hello\, 
 Hi” is expansively rendered by Ty\, mostly by himself\, at home. The iso
 lation suits the songs: you’re only ever as “at home” as you are wit
 h yourself in the mirror. Ty’s acoustic and electric guitars and vocal h
 armonies layer self upon self\, forming a spiny backbone for the album. Te
 xtures at once gentle and dissonant root the songs as they make their move
 : melodic arcs convulsing in doubt and bliss and rage. Busting out of the 
 endless gridlock into open space\, these spirits pass on through.\n“Hell
 o\, Hi”’s flickering awakening to this trip: the opening three tracks
 ’ train of sweet and salty reflections\, before the abrupt crunch of the
  title track electrifies the senses. Good morning’s turned to good mourn
 ing in nothing flat\, but there’s still a way up from the doldrums\, to 
 try again. Why can’t it be just as simple as “Hello\, Hi”? What to d
 o with yourself when love triggers loathing? How many more times do you ha
 ve to go back there again? Pulling at the scratchy wool threads of an old 
 sweater favored for warmth\, comfort\, protection\, rejection\, denial\, b
 lindness etc\, Ty Segall dives from a clear\, open sky\, down through the 
 marine layer and the shimmering waves of all the years.\nRadiating from th
 e same mind fields as Goodbye Bread and Sleeper\, mixed with shard edges o
 f contrast and contradiction from things like Freedom’s Goblin\, Manipul
 ator\, and First Taste\, “Hello\, Hi” is Ty’s most relaxed and compl
 ete production to date\, an ebb-and flow fusion of words and music offerin
 g abstraction and acceptance as it wrestles itself through a fucked-up tim
 e. Your life and what you make of it — throughout “Hello\, Hi\,”
  Ty Segall charts a passage through its enduring tangles honestly\, with c
 larity and confusion. \nCHARLES MOOTHART“Losing Ground is the mutated b
 ridge that connects Soft Crime and Blood Machine. It is the piece that f
 astens the three songs together and outlines them as new visions. Original
 ly\, I thought of the riff for Losing Ground as a bridge in the song struc
 ture sense\, but when I took a step back I realized it had the potential t
 o be a structure of its own. It is one of the more vulnerable tracks I hav
 e made with the vocals pretty far out front. I wanted it to feel hopefully
  battered. Looking up from the floor with feelings of intention and unders
 tanding.”\n\n

 lso of Black Country\, New Road) met Taylor at the Guildhall School Of Mus
 ic & Drama where they were studying jazz and electronic composition respec
 tively. Generally speaking their modus operandi has been to produce a viol
 ently spatially and temporally disrupted form of pop music which sometimes
  sees them gleefully break apart existing styles only to expertly reassemb
 le them and other times sees them mint entirely fresh genres. Both of them
  grew up playing and loving classical music and picked up a bug for jazz i
 n college\, but their other shared interests include Disclosure and Mica L
 evi\, with Taylor having a penchant for Bob Dylan\, and Georgia for Joni M
 itchell. They have released a clutch of singles\, EPs and a mixtape over t
 he last five years\, already giving rise to something of a press narrative
 : Georgia sings a classic pre-rock & roll orchestral lounge pop song while
  Taylor forces it through a post-dubstep blender\, mixing old with new.\nB
 ut their debut LP\, I Love You Jennifer B\, blasts that simplistic reducti
 onism to smithereens. Releasing in the Fall of 2022\, Georgia and Taylor s
 aid: “I Love You Jennifer B is a collection of Jockstrap tracks that hav
 e been 3 years in the making. Everything on it is pretty singular sounding
  so we hope there is a track on there for everyone and something that spea
 ks to you and says ‘I’m a banger.’”\nMuch has been made recently o
 f the resurgence in interest in the song ‘Running Up That Hill (A Deal W
 ith God)’ via its appearance on the Stranger Things 4 soundtrack but Joc
 kstrap are the only young artists in the UK (both are 24) who currently ha
 ve the same vision for bending classic pop into wonderful new shapes that 
 Kate Bush had during the mid-80s. Jockstrap effortlessly capture the chaos
 \, joy\, uncertainty\, intrigue\, pain and romance of 2022 like no other.\

 PM – Show\nAOIFFE NESSA FRANCES\nIn spring of 2020\, Aoife Nessa Frances
  moved out of the city for the first time in her life. After packing up he
 r things in Dublin\, she moved to rural County Clare on the west coast of 
 Ireland\, and there\, amidst the stillness\, she worked on the songs that 
 would become her second album\, Protector. The resulting body of work deft
 ly juxtaposes golden hours and arguments\, affection and alienation\, and 
 above all marks a crucial period of her life that was transformative and l
 eft her wiser.\n \n“I might have been running away from my problems\,”
  she admits. “I was disconnected from myself and from nature\, but I fou
 nd peace far away from the city\, where there were no distractions. I isol
 ated myself with nothing to do but make music.” Writing Protector provid
 ed Frances an essential sounding board for this journey. “I felt a growi
 ng inner strength that guided me through the making of this album. It was 
 like sculpting with my eyes closed\, this intense sense of self-preservati
 on leading me and growing with each song I wrote. When I started\, I didn
 ’t recognise myself. With each song\, I became more human.”\n \nAoife 
 spent that summer with her dad and two sisters. “It was a very special t
 ime for my family as we had never been that tight knit before\,” she say
 s\, “and we all became very close…driving the country roads and swimmi
 ng in the Atlantic Ocean and lakes of Clare. I had one CD in my car: Jim S
 ullivan’s UFO and we listened to it over and over again.” Like many pe
 ople in their late twenties shaking off youthful rebelliousness\, Frances 
 experienced a solidification of familial ties like never before\, and felt
  the formation of a protective\, impenetrable shell. “For me\, Protector
  acknowledges the part of myself that steers me towards a brighter path. T
 he almost psychotropic power of nature gave me a connection I never felt b
 efore. As the countryside seeped into me and lines of communication opened
  up with my family\, I developed an ability to perceive myself and my choi
 ces within an expanded world.”\nINDIGO SPARKE\n \n“To be at the edge\,
  at the precipice of anything\, requires deep surrender. It’s like dying
  over and over again. In the tidal throes of life at its fullest and most 
 intense is the space where grace and strength is fortified and cultivated\
 , is what I am learning” Indigo Sparke ruminates on her magnetic second 
 full-length album Hysteria\, a huge and beautiful sweeping work\, one that
  possesses a rare\, reflective power. From the first few notes\, in the fi
 rst song\, Blue\, something chilling and captivating pierces straight into
  the listener’s chest. With harmonies reminiscent of the voices in our h
 eads\, she examines love\, loss\, grief\, a newly realized rage\, her hist
 ory\, dreams\, and the emotional weather patterns surrounding those sensat
 ions: her words tell the stories\, and the sounds act them out. It’s a d
 iary built for big stages. ‘Hysteria’ arrives just a year after her st
 riking\, minimalist debut\, Echo. Here though\, Sparke offers an expansive
  body of work—it’s a simultaneously nostalgic yet clear and complex co
 llection that expands her sound and outlook. \n

  They self-released Work Drugs’ full-length debut\, Summer Blood\, in mi

  before the end of the year. In 2012\, they released both Absolute Bearing
  and Delta\, with the Amore EP following in February 2013. Another full-le

 \, their sixth LP of original material\, Insurgents\, arrived in March 201

 he incredible\, indelible Jon Spencer (Blues Explosion\, Boss Hog\, Pussy 
 Galore\, Heavy Trash\, etc) is back with the incendiary HITmakers  - a
 nd with his HOTTEST record yet!  Spencer Gets It Lit is classic Jon Spen
 cer taken to the extremis – electro-boogie\, constructivist art pop\, a 
 psychedelic swamp of industrial sleaze and futurist elegance. It is an epi
 c master work of freak beat from the world’s weirdest garage. Across bra
 in-boggling layers of fury\, fuzz guitar\, and a crashbang battery of phas
 er blasts\, photon torpedoes\, and otherworldly zounds\, he frantically sp
 its\, croons\, rhapsodizes\, and seduces. Spencer Gets It Lit is his most 
 complex and groovy record in years\, a dark\, danceable odyssey – both a
  studied take-down of the early 21st century\, and a celebration of the pl
 ace were electricity meets the mind.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nGILLA BAND\n \nWhilst Dublin 4 pi
 ece GillaBand’s cataclysmic sound avoids consignment to any singular gen
 re\, it’s thrusting noise-rock guitars\, heavy techno drumbeats and wail
 ing vocals paired with frontman Dara Kiely’s witty\, mundane and often s
 urrealist lyrics create ‘as perfect an expression of rock’n’roll’s
  essential auto-destructive impulse as this writers ever heard.’(The Gua
 rdian). Trailblazers for modern Irish alternative music and known for thei
 r ferocious live shows which have been described as chaotic\, electrifying
  and ‘genuinely dangerous\, like one last rave before the apocalypse’\
 , Gilla Band are not just a band\, but a force. In 2015 they signed to Rou
 gh Trade Records and let loose their debut album Holding Hands With Jamie 
 to rampant critical acclaim\, and topping this was to be no easy feat\, bu
 t following a 4 year hiatus\, they returned in September with their second
  studio album\, The Talkies\, heralded as ‘one of the biggest comebacks 
 of the year ‘ (Mary Anne Hobbs\, 6Music). The Press landscape hailed it 
 as ‘more abstract and more focused than their debut’ with outstanding 
 reviews from the likes of Crack Magazine (9/10)\,The Irish Times (5*) and 
 Record Collector(5/5). The Talkies was Recorded in November 2018 at Ballin
 tubbert House\, Ireland–the alien construction of the house and its corr
 idors help to navigate their cataclysmic sound within a world of its own. 
 And this enigmatic manor became Gilla Band’s sonic playground. It is an 
 album which is living and breathing\, in a continual state of metamorphosi
 s\, and it encompasses everything there is to love about the Dublin 4-piec
 e while simultaneously instilling an exciting level of discomfort. Their t
 hird album “Most Normal” comes out this October 7thon Rough Trade Reco
 rds.\n*Purchase a ticket to the show by October 7 and receive 20% off of G
 illa Band’s new record “Most Normal”\, out October 7. Discount code

 8PM – Show\n \nCLAN OF XYMOX\n \nSince their formation in their native H
 olland their music has been constantly changing\, always challenging and o
 ften quite breathtaking. Some of us have always been of the opinion that X
 YMOX are something special. A band fired by electronic music but determine
 d\, always\, to make something that is very much their own. They are uniqu

 ). While the studio recordings are made by William and Sarah alone\, the l
 ive lineup includes Paul Sin (bass) and Philly Peroxide (keyboards/percuss
 ion) and Stevyn Grey (drums). The band have always sought to color outside
  of prescribed genre lines\, endeavoring to push past the boundaries of st
 yle into something substantial and vital.\n \nAERTEX\n \nHailing from Wash
 ington DC\, Chris Moore (Repulsion\, Coke Bust\, The Rememberables)\, and
