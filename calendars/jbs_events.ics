 – Doors8PM – Show\n \n \n \nSEAN HAYES\n \nSean Hayes is a Bay Area s
 inger-songwriter who makes music to dance to or cry to\, or maybe both at 
 the same time. He was born in New York City\, raised in North Carolina\, a
 nd honed his earliest musical chops in a band playing Irish and old-time t
 unes — but his unique style of deeply felt\, R&B-inflected folk really m
 atured during his two decades singing and playing in cafes\, bars\, and ni
 ght clubs of San Francisco.\n \nHis voice layers wonder and heartache upon
  grit and gravel\, sex and soul. His lyrics carry an unpretentious wisdom.
  He’s dueted with Aimee Mann\; been covered by the Be Good Tanyas\; and 
 toured with Anais Mitchell (performing songs from Hadestown\, before it wa
 s an award-winning Broadway show). His songs have appeared on NPR\, NBC an
 d HBO.\nJACK SYMES\nOn his sprawling new record\, Tompkins Park\, Jack Sym
 es makes his case as one of folk music’s most compelling new artists. Bo
 rn during a road trip out to his new home in Brooklyn and his unmoored fir
 st months there\, the 12-songs confront the question\, “Are you on your 
 own or are you all alone?.” It’s less tethered to Earth than his previ
 ous excursions\, instead drifting skyward\, buoyed by wide-reaching arrang
 ements and dense washes of reverb that curl off his voice like thick plume
 s of smoke. Inspired by uncertainty and crystallized in isolation\, Jack S
 ymes sophomore album is a testament to spending time with yourself and mak
 ing peace with the parts of you that have been neglected. Written while up
 rooting his life\, and recorded in the blurry ebb of life under a pandemic
 \, the deeply personal songs are at once wholly universal. \n\n

  – Show\nNO AGE\n \nLos Angeles duo No Age updated the spirit of early i
 ndependent punk and hardcore by covering their spiky\, uptempo songs with 
 washes of textural ambient noise. In their earliest days\, the pair sounde
 d like My Bloody Valentine remixing Hüsker Dü’s initial SST output\, b
 orrowing from both the positive-minded D.I.Y. all-ages scene they were hea
 vily involved with in L.A.\, as well as healthy amounts of art world styli
 zation. The group would walk the line between these two poles throughout t
 heir career\, from flirtations with pop-friendly melodies on their 2008 fu
 ll-length Nouns to the blurred art rock of 2013’s An Object. – Fred Th
 omas\nDREAM_MEGA\nAs the lights of the city flicker on through a fading or
 ange haze\, the distinct sound of DREAM_MEGA’s debut EP “minus_world
 ” echoes through a maze of damp alleyways. The project of Los Angeles-ba
 sed artist/musician Joel Kyack\, its sound merges analog synthesizers with
  wind-based instruments like the Thai khlui\, harmonica and voice\, all fi
 ltered through a sweat-soaked fever dream of real-time improvisation\, man
 ipulation and looping.\nAs a founding member and multi-instrumentalist wit
 h the Providence\, RI band Landed\, Kyack helped craft a particular style 
 of heavy\, groove-based chaos that is oft-referenced in “minus_world”\
 , translated here into a dark\, stoned-out vision for a dystopian future. 
 He is also a member of DOS MEGA with Shawn Greenlee and a past member of S
 ix Finger Satellite\, Megafuckers and Street Buddy.\nGODCASTER\nGodcaster 
 is an experimental and hard rock band ephemerally founded by Judson Kolk a
 nd Bruce Ebersole when they were eight and eleven years old. Since then th
 ey’ve experimented with may different styles and have cycled through sev
 eral incarnations of the band. The current cast consists of: David Mcfaul 
 (keys)\, Von Kolk (flute\, vox)\, Jan Fontana (bass)\, Bruce Ebersole (bas

  – Show\nTHE BALLROOM THIEVES (11:00 PM)\nEarly in 2020\, an article was
  released declaring that the music industry needed more happy songs. As Ma
 rtin Earley and Calin Peters recall\, they laughed while reading it\, know
 ing that their work as The Ballroom Thieves explores the spirit of that pa
 radigm. Well\, sort of…they’re not interested in easily defined worldv
 iews.\n \n“We read that article and thought\, ‘how are we supposed to 
 write happy songs right now?'” says Earley. “We don’t write happy so
 ngs\, but this time we decided to try something new by pairing optimistic 
 sounding music with dark lyrics. If the listener is not a lyrics person\, 
 they might not notice.”\n \nThe Ballroom Thieves’ fourth album\, Clou
 ds\, is a song cycle born of mixed experiences and fueled by the power of 
 imagination. The album is a lush meditation on longing to return to tour
 ing – to see different sunsets and cities. But\, it’s also a reflectio
 n of its difficulties\, e.g.\, insomnia brought on by sleeping in differen
 t hotel rooms every night. After a major car accident and the departure of
  a band member\, the duo has taken the duality of all these experiences an
 d translated them into song.\nGEORGIA HARMER (10:00 PM)BRITT THOMAS (9:00 
 PM)Rock ‘n’ roll merges with the influence of dream pop\, psychedelica
  and a touch of country as Philly-based Britt Thomas – Back Mountain\, P
 ennsylvania\, raised – continues to grow her songcraft with an evolving 
 group of friends playing in the band. The current lineup features Todd Fau
 stnacht (Cosmic Guilt) on lead guitar\, Aaron Jollay (Dark Meat\, Folklore
 ) on bass\, Jeff Gregorio on keys and Danny Albi (Steal Your Peach) on dru
 ms.\n \nDuring the lockdown of 2020\, Britt was a featured performer in th
 e Love from Philly Virtual Fest along with such local legends as Kurt Vile
 \, Hall & Oates and The Districts. Since picking back up with the band\, t
 hey have played locally at Johnny Brenda’s with Full Bush and Julian and
  at the Sunflower Garden with Squawk Brothers and The Dawn Drapes. Britt r
 eleased her first EP under the name Britt Thomas and the Breaker Boys on J

 ’s Thelma & the Sleaze at Kung Fu Necktie in Philly\, and since have pla

 riffs anymore\,” says founding member/vocalist/guitarist Jacob Duarte wh
 en asked about his approach on 12th House Rock\, Narrow Head’s highly an
 ticipated LP for Run for Cover due on August 28. “That’s the kind of b
 and we are and to me\, that’s just how you write songs. Drums\, bass\, g
 uitar\, vocals. Nothing else. There are no other instruments on the record
 .”\nThe Houston-based band’s latest entry is the distillation of the g
 reatest moments in 90’s alternative and hard rock with a fresh set of ea
 rs\, thirteen tracks of their signature brand of bludgeoning lullabies bur
 sting at the seams with creative ideas\, new directions and yes\, massive\
 , monolithic riffs. In between the sparkle and smash\, open-hearted and em
 otionally naked songwriting showcases a core piece of the band’s identit
 y– showcasing 12th House Rock as one of the best releases of 2020. “It
 ’s the definitive work of Narrow Head\,” proudly explains bassist Ryan
  Chavez. “Recorded in a studio over a month’s span\, the way they used
  to do it. Not just for the sake of making it that way\, but because it wa
 s the right way for us.”\nTEMPLE OF ANGELS (10:00 PM)\n \nOriginally for
 med in 2017 after meeting at punk shows in their home of Austin\, Texas\, 
 Temple of Angels’ hazy blend of dream pop and post-punk has garnered the
 m a dedicated following throughout the country. Returning for their first 
 shows in 2022 following the recording of their yet-to-be-released debut fu
 ll-length\, the five-piece is looking forward to returning to the stage to
  showcase both new and old material that spans their discography.\nBLEED (
 9:00 PM)\nFabricated in Dallas\, Texas with seemingly effortless self-assu
 rance BLEED’s music harkens back to a period of time when the 90s were g
 oing from mid to late and grunge and more mainstream metal were converging
  in a flurry of credibly hard-hitting\, melodic heaviness that played equa
 lly well on college and mainstream rock radio. The band’s songs hit with
  visceral heavy impact and infectious alt rock hooks\, then given further 
 shape by singer Ryan Hughes whose airy vocals glide fluidly overhead. \n 
 \nAs the band continue the work of crafting their full length LP\, to be r
 eleased by 20 Buck Spin next year\, the label will first finally issue ‘
 Somebody’s Closer’ in physical form on vinyl and tape. In the meantime
  the EP is streaming in full via all platforms and demanding repeat spins.

 ng member Jeff  Mueller is indeed a native of Louisville\, yet June of 44
  as a  band began existence in the fall of 1994 in New York City.  Octob
 er and November of that year saw the band record  it’s first record “
 Engine Takes to the Water” at James  Murphy’s Downtown Brooklyn locat
 ion of his Plantain  Studios as well as performing their first series of 
 concerts.  Throughout the nineties Mueller with Doug Scharin\, Fred  Ers
 kine\, and Sean Meadows would continue to make  records for Chicago’s Q
 uarterstick Records and play  concerts in Taiwan\, Guatemala\, Europe\, A
 ustralia\, and  North America.  In 2018\, June of 44 started playing se

 \nDES DEMONAS (8:00 PM)\n \n“The South will never rise again\,” Jacky 
 Cougar Abok intones in a manner that suggests he is looking straight into 
 your eyeballs while singing the opening track on Des Demonas’ debut LP o
 n In The Red Records. His hand may be around your neck as well! Sounding l
 ike The Last Poets acid tripping to 60’s Sunset Strip\, Des Demonas drag
  you on a wild ride of fuzzy guitars and swirling Farfisa organ while the 
 bass and drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain. And that’s just the 
 first song!\n \nDes Demonas hail from Washington D.C.\, and have been deni
 zens of the byways and highways of the city’s musical underground for ye
 ars. Jacky Cougar Abok is the six-foot-five-inch tall Kenyan punk singer w
 ho has drummed with Thee Lolitas and Foul Swoops. Guitarist Mark Cisneros 
 has bent strings with Kid Congo & The Pink Monkey Birds\, Deathfix\, and M
 edications and pounded the traps for The Make-Up and Benjy Ferree\, the la
 tter alongside organist Paul Vivari. Joe Halladay (Citygoats) on bass and 
 Ryan Hicks (Suns Of Guns) on drums round out this squared circle of sight 
 and sound.\n \nThe songs on Des Demonas range from Nuggets-style snottines
 s on “Tuff Turf”\, to the brash warnings of “Liez” (‘Lies… onl
 y seem to matter if you never wise up’)\, to the stomper “Psychedelic 
 Soldier” and cool psycho creeper “Say You Tried”\, to the hard boile
 d 70’s punk of Swahili-sung “ Golden Eggs”. When Abok sings “There
  are no vampires in Africa\,” it may be a warning. It may be a fact. Or 
 it may be a whole lot of unrelenting scuzzy fun. Dig the Des Demonas. Play
  it loud. Twist your wig.\n– Kid Congo Powers\nNORMAN WESTBERG (SWANS)\n

 (Big Thief) & Mt. Davidson (Twain):\n \nHave you ever…\n \n…faced an i
 mpossible question\, to be answered at once by a kaleidoscope of wind\, di
 ffusing your bewilderment into thousands of spinning bulbs?\n \n…awoken 
 to hear the person sleeping beside you speaking a language they do not spe
 ak in their waking life? …felt your legs possessed\, to throw you acro
 ss the room in shapes? …lost your heart\, only to find it on the bank 
 of a cold spring\, in the hands of a filling station attendant\, or in the
  dust swimming through the light of your bedroom window?\n \n Have you e
 ver listened to Twain?\n \n“A lonely day\, I went outside to smoke awhil
 e\,and think about a picture in a book:He was laying in the grass in his s
 uit\,as the angler posed in pursuit of the fish”\n \n For the past dec
 ade or so\, Mt. Davidson has cultivated his songs and sounds\, attempting 
 to create a bridge\, a meeting place\, between the terrestrial and the mys
 tic.  He is a ponderous and delicate sort of creature\, short and vaguely
  leonine\, who has spent most of his young life abiding in the midlands of
  transcendence.\n \n“Oh to be there\, the smell of her hair\,the deer sw
 imming through the watery woods\,life won’t last long for those who hate
  it\,for those who love it\, it lingers on like a dream”\n \n Followin
 g its quiet self-release in 2014\, his fifth and most recent LP\, Life Lab
 ors in the Choir\, has steadily gained devoted listeners throughout the gl
 obe and continues to blossom today. The album describes a marked evolution
  in an alluring yet strange and hesitant discography. Progressing from the
  bashfully childlike sounds of 2005’s Madeline\, (now lost)\, through se
 lf-constructed garage multi-track tangles of Sleeping Tree (2007) and Alma
 nack (2008)\, we hear the progress of a young man struggling to free himse
 lf from the shackles of depression and neurosis. In 2010’s Love is All A
 round\, a distinct breakthrough can be felt in the form of a question that
  challenges the foundation of the doubt and fear running through the early
  music. This sudden evolution is in no small part owing to the addition of
  two musicians – Peter Pezzimenti (drums and vibes) and Ken Woodward (ba
 sses) – and a sound engineer – Adrian Olsen. The music really began to
  breathe. \n \n “Free’d from doubt\, my cigarette went out\,the sun
  came out and warmed up the house\,oh to be fainting into that painting\,a
 s I wrap up the tune and bring it to you”\nFLORRY\nFlorry is a 7-piece c
 ountry rock band from Philadelphia led by Francie Medosch. They play songs

 gical collaboration to another level with otherworldly cinematographic dim
 ension\, and of course\, the subversive playfulness of two gay lovers unmi
 stakably flirting with their audience and each other. Upon the release of 
 their debut single\, “Daddy”\, their video (chock full of the pair dan
 cing seductively in their white briefs) was removed from YouTube for viola
 ting their “sex and nudity policy.” At this moment\, the band solidifi
 ed their political visibility as queer artists who are not ok with being s
 ilenced or removed from history because of their age or size. Bottum told 
 Rolling Stone\, “​There’s enough representation in the gay communit
 y of young\, hairless pretty men.​” Roddy and Joey’s love for each 
 other and their own bodies\, histories\, and truths are what make this pro
 ject so tender and lovable.\n

 ed Rossiter—love\, heartbreak\, God—approached in a completely new dir
 ection. It’s a record of growth and exploration\, pushing forward into t
 he future with hope while still holding the pain and regrets of the past\,
  seeking a balance for the present.\n \nYoung Jesus began when John Rossit
 er dropped out of college after doing acid with two of his high school fri
 ends and decided to join their band. After several albums\, he moved to L.
 A. with the intention of never playing music again. However\, the new envi
 ronment woke something up in Rossiter\, and he began to write music at a f
 urious pace\, recruiting a new band to explore this new evolution in sound
 . That time for Young Jesus was marked by experimentation and improvisatio
 n\, as the band toured and put out three records with Saddle Creek.\n \nA 
 few years later\, the band had drifted apart from too much time on the roa
 d\, and Rossiter became restless. After the tragic death of a close friend
 \, Rossiter felt a need for change. “I can be kind of a perfectionist an
 d a pretty intense band member\,” says Rossiter. “I drove the band rea
 lly hard for a while\, and I don’t think I realized how hard I was doing
  that. Everyone was just burnt out on me and on each other. And I think I

 s gonna be the one whose mom called him ‘the Golden One\,’ right befor
 e she died.” This is where his debut HBO comedy special\, The Golden One
 \, finds Whitmer: age thirty\, investigating this sense (curse?) of destin
 y-as-identity. It’s been thirteen years since he left Alabama for LA\, b
 ecoming a linchpin for LA’s young\, independent comedy scene with Power 
 Violence\, the monthly show he hosted with friends. But he became haunted 
 by the question: had he already peaked\, just like his mom\, singer in a l
 ocal band with big ambitions that never made it out of the Flora-Bama Loun
 ge in Gulf Shores? Rather than shy away from all that messy self-mythology
 \, Whitmer tapped the source of it all through writing this one-man show f
 eaturing his own original music. Songs from The Golden One\, a companion a

 ynthesizing relatable-content: millennial anxieties\, therapy-speak jokes\
 , and the annals of his own childhood tragedies.\n \nAL MENNE (9:00 PM)\n 
 \nAl Menne has a voice unlike any other. Soft and emotional with lyrical i
 ntimacy that calls back to Transatlanticism-era Death Cab for Cutie\, fitt
 ing as they both share the same Pacific Northwest roots. Now based in Los 
 Angeles by way of Seattle\, Al has spent the last eight years as the lead

 ll of the collaboration\, Al has brought peers in to help with their own s
 olo project recording with luminaries like Christian Lee Hutson and Melina
  Duterte (Jay Som)\, on new music that will become their upcoming debut-al

 revolves around Bon’s view of life as a confusing\, jarring\, and kaleid
 oscopic experience filled with contradictions\, loss\, and change\, so it
 ’s no wonder Bon often looks to light — not so much for specific answe
 rs\, but as a pillar of continuity and a marker of time. Bon has built a s
 olid partnership with her musical collaborator and producer Ryan Albert ov
 er the last few years\, releasing several EPs since 2018. Their work displ
 ays Bon’s emotionally incisive approach to songwriting that draws just a
 s much power from abstract poetry that asks big questions as specific\, pe

 in and out\, inviting listeners to bring their own experiences to these so

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nLAZY EYES\n \nSongBook\, the debu
 t album by Sydney four-piece The Lazy Eyes\, is a world unto itself\, and 
 like every good fantasy world\, it abides by its own logic. Step inside: t
 he colours are a little brighter\; things move a little slower\, but they
 ’re liable to get inordinately faster in the blink of an eye. The landsc
 ape is all hard brick and plasterdust — stoner lurch and Sabbath-y chug 
 — until a hook bursts forth\, unexpected\, like a flower from concrete. 
 Suddenly you’re in a garden in full blossom\, and you didn’t even noti
 ce\; you walked a mile without taking a single step. SongBook is strange
  like that — all journey and all destination\, a decidedly modern marvel
  of psych-rock that’s unpretentious in construction but precious where i
 t counts. In SongBook’s earliest moments\, The Lazy Eyes welcome you to
  their technicolour\, sun-baked universe with open arms: “Can I show you
  all the places you can go\, on this island that I know? All the caves and
  allthe snow\, on the mountains there are goats.”\n \nThe floral brightn
 ess of The Lazy Eyes’ music belies their perfectly mundane origins. Harv
 ey Geraghty\, Itay Shachar and Noah Martin met in their early years at Syd
 ney’s Newtown High School of the Performing Arts. Bonding over a love of
  psych rock\, they banded together as a matter of both taste and necessity
 \, three of the only rhythm section musicians in a school filled largely w
 ith string\, brass and woodwind musicians. They became fast friends\, star
 ted jamming together\, and\, eventually\, began to busk around Sydney\, th
 eir burgeoning band (and friendship) being bound together by long hours pl
 aying and carting their instruments around the city. Around 2015\, as they
  began playing real gigs\, The Lazy Eyes decided to formalise the band as 
 a unit\, a decision that coincided neatly with their meeting of Leon Karag
 ic\, who provided much-needed bass to their ensemble and\, with his knowle
 dge of niche and underground music\, broadened the band’s stylistic and 
 ideological palette. “The biggest thing was that we were close friends f
 irst\, and then the bonus on top of that was that we had the same taste in
  music\, and felt really not weird or awkward about making music together\
 ,” recalls Itay. “We didn’t feel like we had to act a certain way ar
 ound each other\,” says Noah\, “We could just be ourselves\, and—”
  adds Harvey: “Freaky.”\n \nThe intimacy of The Lazy Eyes’ friendshi
 p is felt\, deeply\, in their music\, particularly in their renowned live 
 sets. In the years since they formed\, The Lazy Eyes have become emblemati
 c torchbearers for the Australian psych-rock scene\, accepting the baton f
 rom the iconic bands that first inspired their formation. Off the back of 
 their first two EPs\, released in 2020 and 2021\, The Lazy Eyes have sold 
 out numerous shows along Australia’s east coast\, including their own mu
 sic festival\, Lazyfest\; garnered praise from tastemaking outlets at home
  and abroad\, including Complex\, KCRW\, FBi Radio\, triple j Unearthed\, 
 BBC 6 Music and Radio 1\, and Spin\; been named an NME 100 band for 2021\;
  and more. The band’s reputation continues to grow\, despite the fact th
 at planned international jaunts at SXSW and The Great Escape were cancelle
 d in light of the Covid-19 pandemic\, a disappointing false start that non
 etheless proves the strength of the band’s self-recorded EPs.\n

 armonies layer self upon self\, forming a spiny backbone for the album. Te
 xtures at once gentle and dissonant root the songs as they make their move
 : melodic arcs convulsing in doubt and bliss and rage. Busting out of the 
 endless gridlock into open space\, these spirits pass on through.\n“Hell
 o\, Hi”’s flickering awakening to this trip: the opening three tracks
 ’ train of sweet and salty reflections\, before the abrupt crunch of the
  title track electrifies the senses. Good morning’s turned to good mourn
 ing in nothing flat\, but there’s still a way up from the doldrums\, to 
 try again. Why can’t it be just as simple as “Hello\, Hi”? What to d
 o with yourself when love triggers loathing? How many more times do you ha
 ve to go back there again? Pulling at the scratchy wool threads of an old 
 sweater favored for warmth\, comfort\, protection\, rejection\, denial\, b
 lindness etc\, Ty Segall dives from a clear\, open sky\, down through the 
 marine layer and the shimmering waves of all the years.\nRadiating from th
 e same mind fields as Goodbye Bread and Sleeper\, mixed with shard edges o
 f contrast and contradiction from things like Freedom’s Goblin\, Manipul
 ator\, and First Taste\, “Hello\, Hi” is Ty’s most relaxed and compl
 ete production to date\, an ebb-and flow fusion of words and music offerin
 g abstraction and acceptance as it wrestles itself through a fucked-up tim
 e. Your life and what you make of it — throughout “Hello\, Hi\,”
  Ty Segall charts a passage through its enduring tangles honestly\, with c
 larity and confusion. \nCHARLES MOOTHART“Losing Ground is the mutated b
 ridge that connects Soft Crime and Blood Machine. It is the piece that f
 astens the three songs together and outlines them as new visions. Original
 ly\, I thought of the riff for Losing Ground as a bridge in the song struc
 ture sense\, but when I took a step back I realized it had the potential t
 o be a structure of its own. It is one of the more vulnerable tracks I hav
 e made with the vocals pretty far out front. I wanted it to feel hopefully
  battered. Looking up from the floor with feelings of intention and unders
 tanding.”\n\n

 lso of Black Country\, New Road) met Taylor at the Guildhall School Of Mus
 ic & Drama where they were studying jazz and electronic composition respec
 tively. Generally speaking their modus operandi has been to produce a viol
 ently spatially and temporally disrupted form of pop music which sometimes
  sees them gleefully break apart existing styles only to expertly reassemb
 le them and other times sees them mint entirely fresh genres. Both of them
  grew up playing and loving classical music and picked up a bug for jazz i
 n college\, but their other shared interests include Disclosure and Mica L
 evi\, with Taylor having a penchant for Bob Dylan\, and Georgia for Joni M
 itchell. They have released a clutch of singles\, EPs and a mixtape over t
 he last five years\, already giving rise to something of a press narrative
 : Georgia sings a classic pre-rock & roll orchestral lounge pop song while
  Taylor forces it through a post-dubstep blender\, mixing old with new.\nB
 ut their debut LP\, I Love You Jennifer B\, blasts that simplistic reducti
 onism to smithereens. Releasing in the Fall of 2022\, Georgia and Taylor s
 aid: “I Love You Jennifer B is a collection of Jockstrap tracks that hav
 e been 3 years in the making. Everything on it is pretty singular sounding
  so we hope there is a track on there for everyone and something that spea
 ks to you and says ‘I’m a banger.’”\nMuch has been made recently o
 f the resurgence in interest in the song ‘Running Up That Hill (A Deal W
 ith God)’ via its appearance on the Stranger Things 4 soundtrack but Joc
 kstrap are the only young artists in the UK (both are 24) who currently ha

 n experimental and hard rock band ephemerally founded by Judson Kolk and B
 ruce Ebersole when they were eight and eleven years old. Since then they
 ’ve experimented with quite a few different styles and have had several 
 incarnations of the band. The current cast consists of: David Mcfaul (voca
 ls\, keys)\, Von Kolk (flute\, guitar\, vocals)\, Bruce Ebersole (guitar)\
 , Sam Pickard (drums)\, Jan Fantana (bass) and Judson Kolk (vocals\, guita
 r). The band is known for their ecstatic live performances\, serendipitous
  visual make-believe\, and gritty gut dials. Delve into the fervencies of 
 their sword-like barrage.\nTOMATO FLOWER\nTomato Flower is the result of l
 ong-lasting friendships and overlapping collaborations that found Austyn W
 ohlers\, Mike Alfieri\, and Jamison Murphy (and later adding bassist Ruby 
 Mars) looking for the balance between taut guitars and experimental pop mu
 sic. The Baltimore-based quartet melds irresistible melodies with rhythmic
  trickery and unexpected structures\, bending genre at will. Math rock\, d
 ub\, and bossa might flash by well before the outro. Formal constraint bec
 omes an opportunity for play and surprise\; the pop form becomes a psyched
 elic capsule.\n \n \nTURBO WORLD\n\n \nTurbo World is the sunny and shady 
 brainchild of co-conspirators Stephe Cooper and Caroline Bennett. Best kno
 wn as the mastermind behind avant-prog boppers Cloud Becomes Your Hand and
  a member of Guerilla Toss\, Cooper continues to stand out for his madcap 
 compositions that embody the spirit and ethos of avant rock groups Aksak M
 aboul & Slapp Happy. Joining forces with Bennett\, the manic scribe\, sing
 er\, and multimedia wizard of digital hardcore duo Stice\, their debut alb
 um\, My Challenger\, is an experimental prog-opera that leads listeners o
 n a surreal\, animated jaunt through the world of organized crime. The alb
 um’s north star is Joey the Hitman aka Max Kurschner\, whose 1973 interv
 iew on The David Susskind Show\, forever immortalized on YouTube\, serves 
 as inspiration and source material. They are joined live by Ryan Power\, J

 PM – Show\nAOIFFE NESSA FRANCES\nIn spring of 2020\, Aoife Nessa Frances
  moved out of the city for the first time in her life. After packing up he
 r things in Dublin\, she moved to rural County Clare on the west coast of 
 Ireland\, and there\, amidst the stillness\, she worked on the songs that 
 would become her second album\, Protector. The resulting body of work deft
 ly juxtaposes golden hours and arguments\, affection and alienation\, and 
 above all marks a crucial period of her life that was transformative and l
 eft her wiser.\n \n“I might have been running away from my problems\,”
  she admits. “I was disconnected from myself and from nature\, but I fou
 nd peace far away from the city\, where there were no distractions. I isol
 ated myself with nothing to do but make music.” Writing Protector provid
 ed Frances an essential sounding board for this journey. “I felt a growi
 ng inner strength that guided me through the making of this album. It was 
 like sculpting with my eyes closed\, this intense sense of self-preservati
 on leading me and growing with each song I wrote. When I started\, I didn
 ’t recognise myself. With each song\, I became more human.”\n \nAoife 
 spent that summer with her dad and two sisters. “It was a very special t
 ime for my family as we had never been that tight knit before\,” she say
 s\, “and we all became very close…driving the country roads and swimmi
 ng in the Atlantic Ocean and lakes of Clare. I had one CD in my car: Jim S
 ullivan’s UFO and we listened to it over and over again.” Like many pe
 ople in their late twenties shaking off youthful rebelliousness\, Frances 
 experienced a solidification of familial ties like never before\, and felt
  the formation of a protective\, impenetrable shell. “For me\, Protector
  acknowledges the part of myself that steers me towards a brighter path. T
 he almost psychotropic power of nature gave me a connection I never felt b
 efore. As the countryside seeped into me and lines of communication opened
  up with my family\, I developed an ability to perceive myself and my choi
 ces within an expanded world.”\nINDIGO SPARKE\n \n“To be at the edge\,
  at the precipice of anything\, requires deep surrender. It’s like dying
  over and over again. In the tidal throes of life at its fullest and most 
 intense is the space where grace and strength is fortified and cultivated\
 , is what I am learning” Indigo Sparke ruminates on her magnetic second 
 full-length album Hysteria\, a huge and beautiful sweeping work\, one that
  possesses a rare\, reflective power. From the first few notes\, in the fi
 rst song\, Blue\, something chilling and captivating pierces straight into
  the listener’s chest. With harmonies reminiscent of the voices in our h
 eads\, she examines love\, loss\, grief\, a newly realized rage\, her hist
 ory\, dreams\, and the emotional weather patterns surrounding those sensat
 ions: her words tell the stories\, and the sounds act them out. It’s a d
 iary built for big stages. ‘Hysteria’ arrives just a year after her st
 riking\, minimalist debut\, Echo. Here though\, Sparke offers an expansive
  body of work—it’s a simultaneously nostalgic yet clear and complex co
 llection that expands her sound and outlook. \n

 ane entirely his own in the modern indie landscape\, but he’s never like
 d the sound of the electric guitar? “I’ve tried everything under the s

 en and recorded on a 1966 Fender Stratocaster that reignited his love for 
 the instrument\, Delicate Steve’s captivating new album\, After Hours\, 
 marks a first for Marion\, an earnest\, easygoing collection that revels i
 n the simple joys of plugging in and playing. The songs are sweet and bree
 zy here\, pairing vintage soul grooves with mesmerizing\, wordless melodie
 s\, and Marion’s production work is suitably subtle and restrained\, ste
 pping back in all the right places to let the album’s masterful performa
 nces speak for themselves. In another first\, Marion teamed up with outsid

 ing renowned bassist Shahzad Ismaily (Yoko Ono\, Marc Ribot) and famed Bra
 zilian percussionist Mauro Refosco (David Byrne\, Atoms For Peace) to help
  flesh out the arrangements and stretch his sonic boundaries. The result i
 s Marion’s warmest\, most magnetic work to date\, an inviting\, immediat

 carefree bliss in equal measure.\n

 stage with such diverse and esteemed artists as The Lumineers\, Gregory Al
 an Isakov\, The Cowboy Junkies\, Haley Heynderickx\, and Ani DiFranco. She

 llabaloo” on now La Reserve Records. After five EPs since 2018\, this is
  his first full-length album\, and the wait was worth it. Cortez is a bit 
 of a shapeshifter when it comes to songwriting\, and Hullabaloo finds him 
 drifting in and out of various eras while still retaining the melodic\, ho
 ok-driven sound his fans have come to expect. From the frantic title track
  to the lush and thoughtful psych rock of “Into The Void\,” you can he
 ar traces of 60s folk\, early Bowie\, grunge and even unabashed pop (“Pr
 otein”). His music has been featured on playlists such as Spotify’s 
 “Alternarock”\, “Fresh Folk”\, Apple’s “New In Indie”\, “P
 eak Indie” and “Breaking Rock”. \n \nHullabaloo” was produced by 
 Cortez and Shane Woods (Mo Lowda) at Headroom Studios (Alex G\, Hop Along\

  – Show\nKIDS RETURN\nKids Return is first and foremost a great story of
  friendship between Adrien Rozé and Clément Savoye. It was in Paris\, at
  the age of 13\, that the two musicians met. Like Japanese director Takesh
 i Kitano’s film from which it takes its name\, the French duo’s projec
 t explores the depth within the false naivety of childhood\, and the evoca
 tive power of nostalgia when it blurs the line between joy and sadness.\n 
 \nKids Return’s sound sits somewhere between the Mamas and the Papas’ 
 Californian pop\, Vladimir Cosma’s orchestrations and the modesty of Joe
  Hisaishi’s soundtracks. It draws on Blur’s energy and MGMT’s vocal 
 harmonies\, while revisiting these Anglo-Saxon influences with the precisi
 on and delicacy of bands like Air. The result is a romantic and melancholi
 c melody\, a laboratory of emotions that can be thought of in pictures.\n 
 \nKids Return is also\, at a time when music is essentially produced on co
 mputer\, the choice of an organic\, ample and living sound. With their ana
 logical gears\, which they like to see as children’s toys\, in the manne
 r of François de Roubaix\, Clément and Adrien compose\, produce and writ
 e together. It is between their small Parisian studio and a house suspende
 d between the mountains of the Pyrenees that their pieces are born\, then 
 orchestrated by a string quartet in the countryside. From this journey eme
 rged a dreamlike and sensory music\, a call to dream\, an invitation to ex
 tract oneself from time.\n

 ing vocals paired with frontman Dara Kiely’s witty\, mundane and often s
 urrealist lyrics create ‘as perfect an expression of rock’n’roll’s
  essential auto-destructive impulse as this writers ever heard.’(The Gua
 rdian). Trailblazers for modern Irish alternative music and known for thei
 r ferocious live shows which have been described as chaotic\, electrifying
  and ‘genuinely dangerous\, like one last rave before the apocalypse’\
 , Gilla Band are not just a band\, but a force. In 2015 they signed to Rou
 gh Trade Records and let loose their debut album Holding Hands With Jamie 
 to rampant critical acclaim\, and topping this was to be no easy feat\, bu
 t following a 4 year hiatus\, they returned in September with their second
  studio album\, The Talkies\, heralded as ‘one of the biggest comebacks 
 of the year ‘ (Mary Anne Hobbs\, 6Music). The Press landscape hailed it 
 as ‘more abstract and more focused than their debut’ with outstanding 
 reviews from the likes of Crack Magazine (9/10)\,The Irish Times (5*) and 
 Record Collector(5/5). The Talkies was Recorded in November 2018 at Ballin
 tubbert House\, Ireland–the alien construction of the house and its corr
 idors help to navigate their cataclysmic sound within a world of its own. 
 And this enigmatic manor became Gilla Band’s sonic playground. It is an 
 album which is living and breathing\, in a continual state of metamorphosi
 s\, and it encompasses everything there is to love about the Dublin 4-piec

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nWESTERMAN\n \nUK artist Westerman
  returns with his first offering in two years with the song “Idol\; RE-r
 un” out via Partisan Records. The new track\,produced by James Krivcheni
 a and Westerman\,juxtaposes gentle and celestial sonics with an aggrieved 
 disposition and features artwork by renownedNew York via Portugal Graphic 
 Designer and Illustrator Bráulio Amado. The song was written after Wester
 man emergedfrom a period of disenchantment with making music\, and with th
 e future of his career feeling abstract\, it seemed unclear to Westerman w
 hether the material he was recording would ever be heard. Creatively\, thi
 s offered a strange kind of freedom\, and accommodated some of the most ad
 venturous and unselfconscious songwriting of his career. Finding textures 
 became a central concern taking programming and looping into his own hands
  in a way he never had before\, creating polyrhythmic grooves to lend urge
 ncy to his inner dialogue.”Idol\; RE-run” is the first taste of songs 
 written in this period and provides a hint for what’s to come from Weste
 rman in the coming year. The track featuresJames Krivchenia\, Mikel Patric
 k Avery and Booker Stardrum on drums\, Ben Reed on bass\, Luke Temple on s
 ynth\, Mat Davidson on piano\, Robin Eubanks on the trombone and of course
  Westerman on vocals\, guitar and synth.Speaking about the new song\, West
 erman shares:”The lyrics to the song were written around the same time a
 s the storming of the Capitol. The compulsion towards the pedestal is stro
 ng. The need to scapegoat and revere without logic. Our populists actively
  celebrate their being people who don’t know anything other or better th
 an anyone else\, yet these spectres with their failings conduct our anger 
 and resentment as if they were gods. They are nothing more than the shadow
  of something else\, the face fronting a need to be loved or revered prese
 nt in everyone. And there will always be another face to front.”\n
