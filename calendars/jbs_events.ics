 oors8 PM – Show\nTAYLOR KELLY \nBorn and raised in Rochester\, NY\, Tayl
 or Kelly is now a fixture in the vibrant Philadelphia music scene further 
 honing her introspective take on jazz\, soul\, and funk. She combines her 
 smooth\, powerful\, technically-informed voice with addictive hip hop and 
 electronic beats and complex arrangements. Her sound is a dynamic blend of
  several genres but ultimately establishes a strikingly authentic niche al
 l its own – rich with melodic contour\, intricate harmonies\, and deeply
  personal but anthemic lyricism. Kelly has released six albums and EPs and
  has shared the stage with St. Paul and the Broken Bones\, Dirty Loops\, M
 oonchild\, Becca Stevens\, Monophonics\, Neal Francis and Giacomo Turra. S
 he has amassed over 800k listens for her single “California” on stream
 ing platforms worldwide while her singles “Maybe” (2021) and “Let Yo
 u Go” (2023) were featured on Chicago’s Vocalo Radio (where she was al
 so interviewed). Kelly released a Key Session recorded live at WXPN’s st
 udios for NPR Music in April of this year and in June released an album en
 titled ‘Live in Philly’ which was recorded live at Brooklyn Bowl Phila
 delphia on December 30 th of 2022 when she opened for St. Paul. Kelly has 
 uplifted\, inspired and energized thousands of ardent concertgoers at hund
 reds of live shows with her immersively freeing performance style. She has
  an unyielding\, marrow-deep commitment to self-expression through music a
 nd has continued to transfer this passion to her listeners with ‘Live in
  Philly’. Her upcoming EP ‘The Spins’ releases on July 19th on Head

 oors8 PM – Show\nTHE CLIENTELE\nThe Clientele’s ‘I Am Not There Anym
 ore’ follows 2017’s ‘Music for the Age of Miracles’ (which arrived
  after a seven-year hiatus for the band)\, with new recording sessions beg
 inning in 2019 and continuing piecemeal until 2022 —in part due to the p
 andemic and also because the band wanted the space to experiment. “We’
 d always been interested in music other than guitar music\, like for donke
 y’s years\,” vocalist/lyricist/guitarist Alasdair MacLean says. This t
 ime out\, he — alongside bassist James Hornsey and drummer Mark Keen —
  incorporated elements of post-bop jazz\, contemporary classical and elect
 ronic music. According to MacLean\, “None of those things had been able 
 to find their way into our sound other than in the most passing way\, in t
 he faintest imprint.”This stretching out — what MacLean calls “a lea
 p forwards and to the side” — can be heard clearly in “Blue Over Blu
 e\,” with its percussive samples and its moments where the arrangement o
 pens up suddenly into something cinematic in scope\, with horns and string
 s. “What happened with this record was that we bought a computer\,” Ma
 cLean explains. Under the old Clientele way of recording\, a tricky song l
 ike “Blue Over Blue” might’ve eaten up all their studio time\, as th
 ey worked out the time signature and the instrumentation. For ‘I Am Not 
 There Anymore\,’ though\, the trio would lay down a few tracks and then 
 take them home to play around\, trying out different arrangements before r
 eturning to the studio to finish recording all the little instrumental enh
 ancements.“Blue Over Blue” depicts MacLean’s scary adventure of bein
 g lost in the woods with his son\, he explains: “‘Blue Over Blue’ is
  about getting lost in the woods on Hampstead Heath on an autumn day with 
 my two-year-old son on my shoulders—he loved it and wanted to play hide 
 and seek. I knew he was a ticking time bomb as I had no food with me and w
 as trying to find my way back to a path.” The accompanying video sees th
 e band adorned in armor beneath beautiful and abstract artwork.Over the 32
 -year career of the pop band The Clientele\, critics and fans have often d
 escribed their songs with words like “ethereal\,” “shimmering\,” 
 “hazy\,” “pretty” and “fragile.” MacLean\, though\, has his ow
 n interpretation of the effect his music creates. “It’s that feeling o
 f not being there\,” he says. “What’s really been in all the Cliente
 le records is a sense of not actually inhabiting the moment that your body
  is in.”\nTHE SMASHING TIMES\nThe Smashing Times are your new favorite M
 OD heartthrobs. Is there REALLY a new Merseybeat Revolution?How many time
 s can you really REALLY watch The Blow-Up alone in your room?Why don’t y
 ou venture out the front door and take a bite of the real thing?The Smashi
 ng Times are a mainstay in the indie pop underground. The group mistrals 
 the new modern life perfectly\, the sharper world.Collaged with 12 string

 oors9 PM – Show\nKIND HEARTED STRANGERSHailing from all corners of the c
 ountry\, Kind Hearted Strangers began in the foothills of Colorado – whe
 re an impromptu open mic performance by songwriter Marc Townes quickly evo
 lved into something much bigger. With genre bending improvisations from le
 ad guitarist Kevin Hinder and bassist/vocalist Ace Engfer\, KHS has become
  a dynamic full band capable of bridging the gap between all out rock n’
  roll and their harmony-driven acoustic roots. The addition of drummer Egg
 y Gorman has seen the band grow into a road-driven force\, hungry for live
  music\, delivering high-energy rock shows across the country.The debut re
 cord “East // West” (2021) explores both the sonic & stylistic origins
  of the band while giving listeners a taste of the group’s diverse influ
 ences.Out April 7th\, 2023 – the band’s 2nd LP entitled “Now.here”
  features a collaboration with visual artist/painter Dylan Lynch. This imm
 ersive project found the band working in a shared Richmond\, VA warehouse 
 space for 5 days. With no prepared material\, the artists intentionally pu
 t pressure on themselves to create and deliver a Live Concert & Art Exhibi
 tion at the end of the week. The resulting album contains brand new materi
 al that was recorded live with the same raw energy and passion KHS has bee
 n delivering across the country during their busiest year of touring to da
 te.\nXIXIX\nBorn out of quarantine boredom\, XIXIX is the solo project of
  Philadelphia based music producer Will Brown. Pulling influences from t
 he synthesizers of LCD Soundsystem and The Cure to the screaming guitars 
 of Neil Young and Built to Spill\, XIXIX best serves an intentional liste
 ner who can separate intrapersonal lyricism from a highly approachable so
 undscape. Released in fall of 2021 his debut album set the stage for an e
 thereal synth pop experience\, only to be juxtaposed by a raw and aggress
 ive live show driven by Brown’s guitar playing and affinity for punk an
 d hardcore. With nothing left to the imagination besides how to pronounce
  the name\, there’s no sense that Brown is playing a part when he bring
 s himself onstage. Brown’s effortless genre-blending style is credited 
 to the way he’s been able to chameleon himself into an amalgam of diffe
 rent bands and collaborations across his career. His debut record featur
 ed credits from Grammy Award winning engineer/producer Nicolas Vernes (Wa
 r on Drugs\, Animal Collective\, Deerhunter). As a producer and session m
 usician\, Brown has since collaborated with a number of artists including
  Caiola\, Moustapha Noumbissi\, and Mike Frazier among others.TUCKED IN\n

 n his first album under this new moniker\, titled BLK VINTAGE\, BLK ODYSSY
 ―born and raised in Plainfield\, NJ\, based in Austin\, TX― dives into
  his personal history as a Black musician and the world he’s grown up ar
 ound. It’s an album deeply informed by individual experiences but applie
 d to the plight of Black Americans everywhere. Even when the album chooses
  smooth vibes and laid back lyrics in favor of overt activism\, there’s 
 a philosophical bent that inspires BLK ODYSSY’s work. BLK VINTAGE is ins
 pired by a few key moments and artists. There’s the death of BLK ODYSSY
 ’s brother\, who was killed at the hands of police officers while BLK OD
 YSSY was living in New Jersey. It’s the seminal moment of BLK ODYSSY’s
  life\, the moment he was forced to become an adult and reckon with the ha
 rsh reality of being Black in America. It fuels everything he does\, espec
 ially his activism.After making a name for himself as an Americana musicia
 n\, BLK ODYSSY decided to ditch the popularity he gained in favor of creat
 ing music that would reflect his own experiences and worldview. The result
  is BLK ODYSSY\, and this first project\, BLK VINTAGE\, moves with the urg
 ency of an artist finally realizing their true sound. “I want to create 
 something that will be culturally impactful for my people. I want to do so
 mething that is impactful on a larger scale\, something that is for groups
  of Black people across the country.” There’s “1980\,” which slink
 s with the rich funk-soul of artists like Anderson .Paak and Knxwledge\, b
 ut BLK ODYSSY’s half-rapped cadence is wholly unique and utterly intoxic
 ating. The moments of levity hit equally as hard as the work refracted thr
 ough the trauma BLK ODYSSY has experienced. Still\, though\, BLK ODYSSY ha
 s the rare ability to present multiple sides of himself. “Hang Low” is
  a sultry love jam\, strutting with velvet harmonies and a bass line strai
 ght out of the Pino Palladino school of indestructible grooves.The good ti
 mes occasionally give way to introspection and remembrance\, though. The d
 eath of BLK ODYSSY’s brother makes its way into the powerful “Drinking
  Good\,” but he balances it with a desire to inspire the next generation
 . “My goal is to connect with the black youth\, and my goal is to connec
 t with my people and speak to them on a level where we can stop suffering 
 from happening\,” he explains. “There’s only so much we can do for t
 he dead. This record asks: ‘How can we stop this from happening again?'
 ” Though the music is deeply tied to BLK ODYSSY’s own identity\, he sp
 eaks a universal music in his language\, one easily relatable for those th
 at want to see a better world.\nBLK ODYSSY’s VIP Package:\n\nOne merch i

 play guitar at a very young age\, dabbling in everything from classical\, 
 blues\, classic rock\, and flamenco. They’d spent much of their early 20

  for a musical community. Llobet would eventually move to Brooklyn\, but a
 fter three years of looking for a hopeful artistic breakthrough\, they spe
 nt much of their time in seclusion\, consumed by social anxiety and impost
 er syndrome—and they were considering abandoning songwriting completely.
  One day\, while commuting through Penn Station and en route to their par

 hase of a secondhand Tascam cassette recorder)\, they noticed Patti Smith

  aesthetically\, since their beginning\, meticulously crafting and perfect
 ing a sound that is melded together from pieces of folk\, soul\, and rock 
 n’ roll. On 13th September\, they will release their new album Divided 
 Kind. This album is the lifetime’s work of two scholars of music whose i
 ndividual backgrounds in the arts have forged a strict artistic discipline
  that exists in sharp contrast to the more traditionally laissez-faire wor
 ld of rock and popular music. Over a catalog of six albums\, Native Harro
 w have produced a discography of “rich\, engrossing records” and “in
 stant classics” while single-mindedly following their own artistic code\
 , acquiescing only to the exigence of the song: each song its own world wi
 th its own rules. Their original perspective and extraordinary songwritin
 g\, combined with a completely individual approach to crafting albums and 
 steering their career\, has garnered them coverage at Uncut\, Mojo\, The 
 Guardian\, Rolling Stone\, The Line of Best Fit\, Paste\, American Songwri
 ter\, The Bluegrass Situation\, Holler\, Rough Trade\, Telegraph\, The Eve
 ning Standard\, The Times\, Shindig\, The Sun\, and many more. They’ve 
 shared stages with the Eagles\, Robert Plant & Alison Kraus\, Beth Hart\
 , Sierra Ferrell\, The Heavy Heavy\, Courtney Marie Andrews\, The Cactus 
 Blossoms\, Great Lake Swimmers\, Esme Patterson\, and more.\nWhereas Nativ
 e Harrow’s previous records have grown increasingly more expansive\, bot
 h stylistically and in terms of the musical forces applied\, Divided Kind 
 counters this categorical unfurling with a lateral move towards the ground
 \, with both feet firmly planted\, in a folk-soul-rock sound that still ex
 plores their love of RnB\, jazz\, country\, and farther-flung inspirations
  while simultaneously digging in\, with more authority\, to the musical wo
 rld they have constructed. Or maybe they’re still searching\, and Divide
 d Kind is what’s next. Their refusal to be put in a box\, and their rele
 ntless insistence on catering to the demands of each individual song sugge
 sts the latter is likely the truth at hand.\n \n\n

  betrays the simple truth that the road here was not without difficulty. R
 eferring to the 2021 breakout An Overview on Phenomenal Nature as her “i

 en it came to touring and releasing her own music. “I was channeling wha
 t I knew in that moment — feeling lost\,” Jenkins recalls. “When tha
 t record came out\, and people started to respond to what I had written\, 
 my plans to quit were foiled in the most unexpected\, heartening\, and gen
 erous way. Ready or not\, it reinvigorated me.”Immediately upon finishin
 g two years of touring An Overview\, Jenkins approached recording a follow
 -up\, only to find that capturing the creative spark while “running on f
 umes” was tough. “I was coming from a place of burn out and depletion\
 , and in the months following the session\, I struggled to accept that I d
 idn’t like the record I had just made. It felt uninspired\,” she confe
 sses\, “so I started over.” With her closest musical co-conspirators r
 eassembled\, and producer\, engineer\, and mixer Andrew Lappin (L’Rain\,
  Slauson Malone 1) behind the board\, Jenkins set the prior sessions aside
  and began constructing My Light\, My Destroyer from its ashes: “When we
  listened back in the control room that first day\, I could see a space on
  my record shelf start to open up\, because the songs were finding their h
 ome in real time. That spark informed the blueprint for the rest of the al
 bum\, and its completion was propelled by a newfound momentum.”\n

 from Marnie Stern\, but when her guitar bursts in like a shower of stardus
 t on The Comeback Kid\, the follow-up to 2013’s The Chronicles of Marnia
 \, it’s like no time has passed.But this is no nostalgia trip. The Comeb
 ack Kid is a statement of intent. “I can’t keep on moving backwards\,
 ” Stern repeats on anthemic opening track “Plain Speak\,” her finger
 s furiously tapping the fretboard as the song joyfully zips forward like a
  rocket hitting warp speed. Stern continually pushes herself outside of he
 r comfort zone throughout The Comeback Kid\, including not leaning on the 
 tapping technique that launched a thousand Eddie Van Halen comparisons. 
 “Til It’s Over” is as straight-ahead an “alternative rock” song 
 as Stern has ever made and there’s a cover of Ennio Morricone’s “Il 
 Girotondo Della Note.”“It was so great to be able to start being mysel
 f again and when I would think\, ‘Oh\, is that too\, too weird?’ I’d
  remember I’m allowed to do whatever I want! This is mine. It’s me\,
 ” says Stern of writing songs for The Comeback Kid. “I’m trying to g
 o against the grain of this bullshit that when you get older\, you lose yo
 ur sense of taste. I want to empower people to not be so homogenous and go
  against the grain a little bit.”Taking joy in your individuality is the
  message of The Comeback Kid\, as is the realization that making music whi
 ch truly reflects who you are in all your brightness and your weirdness is
  quite possibly the key to happiness. “This record is about reassuring y
 ourself that happiness is not about what kind of things you have or how ma
 ny things you have or what you don’t have—it’s about all the good th
 ings you do\,” says Stern.\nGOLD DIME\nGold Dime is an unapologetic art 
 rock band & the brainchild of Andrya Ambro\, best known as half the duo Ta
 lk Normal. Her songs are not for the faint of heart. 2017 brought the rele

 eleased in 2019\, both on Fire Talk. Gold Dime released their third album 
 No More Blue Skies this past October on No Gold – a new imprint from Ang

 espair that’s defined much of the past few years of American life\, exam
 ining the power (or naïveté\, depending on your perspective) of positive
  thinking in the face of chaos and uncertainty. The songs here are tender

 Jack Torrey and Page Burkum’s airtight harmonies\, and the performances 
 are warm and intimate to match\, delivered with a soulful\, ’70s-inspire
 d palette of playful Wurlitzer\, breezy guitars\, and muscular percussion.
 The Cactus Blossoms broke out nationally in 2016 with their JD McPherson-p
 roduced debut\, You’re Dreaming. Dates with Kacey Musgraves\, Jenny Lewi
 s\, and Lucius followed\, as did raves from the New York Times and NPR\, w
 ho praised “the brothers’ extraordinary singing.” The band was furth
 er catapulted into the spotlight in 2018\, when David Lynch tapped them to
  perform in the return of Twin Peaks\, and continued to build on their suc
 cess with their 2019 sophomore LP\, Easy Way\, which led Rolling Stone to 
 laud the duo’s “rock-solid\, freak of genetics harmonies.”\nERIN RAE

 oldwave/New Beat band from Brussels\, Belgium\, formed in late 2019 by fro
 ntman and multi-instrumentalist Sam Huge and keyboardist/producer Gaelle S
 ouflet. In 2023\, they were joined on stage by keyboardist and percussioni
 st Alexis Andrigo.ULTRA SUNN expresses a desire for modernity through its 
 themes\, fresh approach to sounds\, and collaborations (Kontravoid\, Kris 
 Baha\, Curses\, Sarin) while being the heirs of the famous Sound Of Belgiu
 m and classical EBM. ULTRA SUNN regularly played alongside Front 242\, Nit
 zer Ebb\, DAF\, or A Split Second.In 2020 with the release of their hit 
 “Keep Your Eyes Peeled\,” the duo gained widespread recognition\, perf
 orming concerts all around the world\, from Brussels to Los Angeles\, Las 
 Vegas\, Calgary\, Sao Paulo\, Mexico\, Bogota\, Berlin\, London\, and many
  more.The band has already released 3 EPs called ‘Night is Mine’\, ‘
 Body Electric’ and ‘Kill Your Idols’\, all borrowing from their acti
 vities in classical arts and fashion shows\, their New Beat and EBM inspir
 ations\, and their desire to create dancing and luminous hymns about self-
 improvement\, gender equality\, fight against anxiety. Always with an incl
 usive\, powerful\, and positive spirit.In 2023\, ULTRA SUNN signed a world
 wide\, multi-album deal with Canadian-based label Artoffact Records and th
 en embarked on a tour in Latin America\, (Mexico\, Medellin\, Bogota\, Lim
 a\, Santiago\, and Sao Paulo).The duo announces their first full LP for Ap
 ril 2024 as well as two USA tours for Spring and Fall 2024. The first tou
 r will include the Sick New World Festival in Las Vegas then Los Angeles\,
  the band will also play up the West Coast to end in Vancouver\, Canada. T

 a then pass through Louisiana\, Texas\, and Tennessee among other places\,
  and end in Chicago.\nNIGHT SINS (Philly)Night Sins (Kyle Kimball formally
  the drummer of Philly staples of NOTHING) is aural proof this side of the

  down the musical path originally cut by The Sisters of Mercy and Clan of 
 Xymox with enough hints of The Mission and extensions into 80’s darkwave
  to produce memorable songwriting that stands on it’s own. Bass and drum
 s punch through the mist thick as thieves\, guitar lines circle like falco

 has inspired her creative practice\, she responds with a characteristic jo
 ke wrapped in an earthen warmth – “There are big hills\, three rivers\
 , and more bridges than anywhere in the whole world.” Growing up in a fa
 mily of art and music in a city with a small\, but vigorously supportive s
 cene\, Merce has been going to shows here her whole life\, even playing th
 em with the “grown up” friends of her parents – as recently as a few
  years ago\, her band was comprised of her own father and his peers in the
  Pittsburgh music community.Merce took a step back in 2020\, after releasi
 ng her last album Moonth\, to reassess during an era of anxiety and lockdo
 wn – even the reliably nourishing exercise of releasing and playing musi
 c felt precarious. “I was grappling with what kind of relationship I wan
 ted with music in my life. It was just something I’d always done\, and I
  didn’t want to lose the magic of that – but I was just having less fu
 n.” In this time of restless confusion\, she turned her gaze inwardly\, 
 down to the roots – figuratively and literally.“I got dirty and slept 
 outside most of the summer. I learned a lot about plants and farming\, jus
 t writing for myself\, and in that time I just slowly accumulated songs.
 ” A never-ending creative hunger\, supported by the community framework 
 she’d always been able to depend on\, had been newly fertilized by the w
 ide-eyed inspiration that came from plunging her hands into both the earth
 ’s soil and her own. Rooting around for an answer\, finding and turning 
 in her palms what had been buried there all along – from this rediscover
 y\, imbued with the vitality of earth’s green magic\, Watch Me Drive The
 m Dogs Wild sprouted forth.\n \nGREG FREEMAN\n“Greg Freeman deals in bi
 blical deluges\, apocalyptic fever dreams\, Floridian miscreants\, and gre
 en mountain malaise. On his excellent debut LP “I Looked Out\,” Gregs
 ’s voice takes center stage\, creaking\, crooning\, and cutting through 
 clouds of static. The songs are linked together by a palpable urgency\, wh
 ether it is the punch-in-the-face\, careening momentum of “Tower\,” th
 e country-gazing guitar squall of “Souvenir Heart\,” or the singalong 
 finale of “Palms.” Careful arrangements and production choices bring o
 ut the best of the 7-piece band that ornament the album with pedal steel\,
  horns\, eerie strings\, and tape warbles. Greg’s strong narrative songw
 riting is equally effective chronicling the demise of a 1920s ocean liner 
 as it is documenting his own interpersonal uncertainties. The sounds on th
 e record conjure up the feeling of driving around Chittenden County in the
  middle of winter\, high beams on\, slush on the floor mats. It’s hard f
 or me to imagine a more promising debut record\, and I can’t wait to see
  where this band goes next.” – Garrett Linck\n \nMARY ST MARY\nPhilad

 oors8 PM – Show\nFRENCH CASSETTES\nFrench Cassettes music is filled with
  winding melodies that pop up unexpectedly but grab hold and don’t let g
 o… and may leave you asking “who needs hands with hooks like these?”
 The harmony-driven power-pop quartet’s new LP\, Rolodex (Sophomore LP re
 leased on Tender Loving Empire)\, was conceived beneath a stairwell in the
  band’s adopted hometown of San Francisco\, where frontman Scott Huerta 
 spent months staying up until 4 am\, obsessing over elaborate demos that w
 ould eventually become his band’s sophomore album. “I adopted the ment
 ality\, which was probably unhealthy\, that every song I wrote needed to b
 e my favorite song\,” he remembers. “I lost my mind so many times in t
 he middle of the night.” The album was self-recorded by lead guitarist 
 Mackenzie Bunch in just about every corner of the Bay Area\, and the songs
  that were eventually stitched together are hook-filled and rooted in pop.
  But they’re also layered and intricate recordings: complex vocal harmon
 ies and counter-harmonies\, Rob Mills’ inventive percussion\, Thomas’ 
 (Scott’s brother) honey-coated basslines\, and every shade of clean and 
 fuzzy guitars stacked up like an orchestra. These uncommonly majestic\, es
 oteric pop forms serve as the perfect delivery service for Huerta’s play
 ful and verbose lyrics\, which are often presented as semi-autobiographica
 l puzzles.Taken together\, the eight tracks and 24 minutes that make up Ro
 lodex are an epic statement of purpose in a decidedly taut package. One th
 at brought a band back together\, more mature and more ambitious than ever

 ctavia E. Butler\, an album title from a collection of metaphysical poetry
 \, and an expansion in consciousness brought on by personal crisis\, guita
 rist and songwriter Shana Cleveland learns to embrace a changing world wit
 h unconditional love on News of the Universe\, the new full-length from Ca
 lifornia rock band La Luz.News of the Universe is a record born of calamit
 y\, a work of dark\, beautiful psychedelia reflecting Cleveland’s experi
 ence of having her world blown apart by a breast cancer diagnosis just two
  years after the birth of her son. It’s also a portrait of a band in flu
 x\, marking the first appearance for drummer Audrey Johnson and the final 
 ones from longtime members bassist Lena Simon and keyboardist Alice Sandah
 l\, whose contributions add a bittersweet edge to a record that is both el
 egy for an old world and cosmic road map to a strange new one.But is there
  any band in the world more suited to capturing the chaos of change in all
  its messy beauty than La Luz? Formed by Cleveland in 2012\, La Luz is bel
 oved for their ability to balance bedlam and bliss\, each new record anoth
 er fine-tuning of the band’s mix of swaggering riffs with angelic vocals
  borrowed from doo-wop and folk\; a band so reliably great that it makes t
 he huge step forward in confidence and sheer musicality that is News of th
 e Universe all the more formidable. Cleveland\, also a writer and painter\
 , has developed into a truly original songwriter with her own canon of hau
 nted psychedelia that\, in recent years\, has drawn upon the changing land
 scape around her rural California home for inspiration\, notably on last y
 ear’s critically acclaimed solo release\, Manzanita\, a magical realist 
 documentation of her pregnancy and early motherhood that appeared on many 
 year-end lists.Yet if Cleveland has spent years writing songs about ghosts
 \, what lurks in the shadows of News of the Universe is nothing less than 
 death itself. “There are moments on this album that sound to me like the
  last frantic confession before an asteroid destroys the earth\,” says C
 leveland.\nMIA JOY\nMia Joy has had music in her bones her entire life. Ra
 ised in a spiritual home to Musician and Poet parents\, Mia has been singi
 ng since she was a baby and joined the Chicago Children’s Choir at a you
 ng age. Mia’s brand of ethereal pop is equally indebted to 90s R&B Icons
  such as Sade to the ethereal ambient compositions of Grouper. “I bought
  my loop pedal because it’s the same loop pedal that Liz Harris of Group
 er had. I just spent my college check on it.” Spirit Tamer\, Mia’s deb
 ut record out on Fire Talk on April 30th 2021\, draws influences from both
 : emotive synth pop (“Haha”\, “See Us”) and yearning meditative in
 terludes that trace the peripheral edges between tracks. The album title c
 omes from a poem Joy wrote long ago (“writing was my first love”)\, an
 d the melding of her creative upbringing interweaves a sonic history that 
 unfolds as Joy herself attempts to piece together the fractured pieces tha
 t shape growing up and growing into your own skin.\n

 it out\, fleeing down eight flights of stairs and a “wall of grey smoke\

 Whammy\, a collection of 12 songs that pick at the fragile membrane betwee

 oors8 PM – Show\nSHEER MAGUnderlying every great record\, every career-d
 efining work of art\, is a certain ineffable\, increasingly rarified quali
 ty: unity of vision. Great songs need not announce their greatness: their 
 marriage of idea with action\, soul with sound\, appears as something whic
 h is naturally effortless\, unforced—they are what they are because they
  have no choice but to be. On Playing Favorites\, Sheer Mag’s third full
  length and first with Third Man Records\, this precise\, matured clarity 
 of vision is put on full display. Over the course of the past decade\, She
 er Mag have labored to carve out a discernibly singular position within th
 e canon of contemporary rock: toggling with ease between the refined flour
 ishes of a “connoisseur’s band” and the ecstatic colloquialism of po
 pulist songwriting—yet displaying no strict loyalty to either camp—the
 ir sound\, while oft-referenced\, is unmistakably and immediately recogniz
 able as theirs alone. With Playing Favorites\, Sheer Mag have capitalized 
 on a decade’s worth of devotion to their own collective spirit—a spiri
 t refined in both the sweaty trenches of punk warehouses and the larger-th
 an-life glamour of concert halls—emerging with a dense work of gripping 
 emotions\, massive hooks\, and masterfully constructed power-pop anthems. 
 This is the record the Philadelphian rock and roll four-piece has always b
 een destined to make.\nTHE OUTSECTThe members of The Out-Sect all met whil
 e living in a Philadelphia junkyard. On weekends\, they would gather to dr
 ink beers inside a broken down 1982 GMC Caballero with a copy of Back From
  The Grave stuck in the car’s cassette player. Instantly being drawn to 
 the trashy sounds of those pimple-faced mid-60s punks\, they figured they 
 could write a song half as good as any of them. And that’s just what the
 y did! Using instruments they found in the trash\, the band has managed to
  write a handful of deranged “songs” that will leave you asking yourse
 lf “What is that smell?” and “Dear god\, can they just stop playing?

 event. People and things coming around again. The intuit\, passing through
  wormholes and time\, sounding deep then dissolving into the universal. Th
