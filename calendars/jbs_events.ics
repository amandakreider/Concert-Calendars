 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nTHE CACTUS BLOSSOMS\n \n“Hey ba
 by\, do you wanna take a trip with me? / I’ve got a feeling there might 
 be a silver lining all around.” So begins One Day\, the captivating new 
 album from critically acclaimed Minneapolis duo The Cactus Blossoms. Writt
 en and recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic\, the record explores the ten
 sion between optimism and despair that’s defined much of the past few ye
 ars of American life\, examining the power (or naïveté\, depending on yo
 ur perspective) of positive thinking in the face of chaos and uncertainty.
  The songs here are tender and timeless\, with straightforward arrangement
 s centered around brothers Jack Torrey and Page Burkum’s airtight harmon
 ies\, and the performances are warm and intimate to match\, delivered with
  a soulful\, ’70s-inspired palette of playful Wurlitzer\, breezy guitars
 \, and muscular percussion.\n \nThe Cactus Blossoms broke out nationally i
 n 2016 with their JD McPherson-produced debut\, You’re Dreaming. Dates w
 ith Kacey Musgraves\, Jenny Lewis\, and Lucius followed\, as did raves fro
 m the New York Times and NPR\, who praised “the brothers’ extraordinar
 y singing.” The band was further catapulted into the spotlight in 2018\,
  when David Lynch tapped them to perform in the return of Twin Peaks\, and
  continued to build on their success with their 2019 sophomore LP\, Easy W
 ay\, which led Rolling Stone to laud the duo’s “rock-solid\, freak of 
 genetics harmonies.”\nTWO RUNNERTwo Runner is Paige Anderson and Emilie
  Rose. The American Roots duo from Northern California embody the hills th
 ey grew up in. Through the mediums of clawhammer banjo\, flatpicking guita
 r\, vocal harmonies\, and oldtime fiddle\, Two Runner puts a hip take on t
 he Appalachian feel.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nMR TWIN SISTER\n \nMr Twin Sister
  formed in 2008 under the name Twin Sister\, quickly garnering critical at
 tention from the dense homemade pop of their early EPs – Vampires with D
 reaming Kids in 2008 and Color Your Life in 2010. They have been a quietly
  influential fixture of independent music ever since. The group released t
 heir debut LP In Heaven (2011) via Domino\, and in 2012 their song Meet th
 e Frownies was sampled by Kendrick Lamar and Dr Dre on The Recipe. Having 
 left Domino and changed their name to Mr Twin Sister\, the group re-emerge
 d in 2014 with the low lit disco and funk of their self-titled Mr Twin Sis
 ter. The record appeared on best-of-year lists from Pitchfork\, Gorilla vs
  Bear\, TIME\, and many others.  In 2018 the group released Echo Arms\, t
 heir most popular track to date\, and Salt\, their third and most diverse 
 album yet. 2021 saw the release of the group’s fourth full length LP Al 
 Mundo Azul\, a vibrant\, surreal record that swaps the group’s restraine
 d cool for something wide awake and grinning. Mr Twin Sister has made a ha
 bit of swerving the expectations of their devoted following and critical o
 utlets alike\, recombining musical styles and dodging easy categorization 
 as a matter of course.\nPSYMON SPINEPsymon Spine’s latest album ‘Chari
 smatic Megafauna’ explored complicated feelings and catharsis through a 
 singular approach to left-of-center indie\, electronic and dance sounds. T
 he release earned praise from publications such as Paste\, FLOOD\, Brookly
 n Vegan\, Under The Radar\, and NME\, and saw playlist support from NPR Mu
 sic (New Music Friday)\, Spotify (All New Indie\, undercurrents\, Fresh Fi
 nds)\, Apple Music (Midnight City\, Today’s Indie Rock)\, and TIDAL (Ris

 g in some way since 2015\, is a project united around the observations and
  explorations of Heather Jones (they/she). Alongside Heather’s work as a
  freelance audio engineer\, ther has often served as a capsule of unnervin
 g anxieties fluttering around\, set to music. Heather sees trembling as 
 “trying to capture the feeling of a thousand ongoing apocalypses swarmin
 g in a pivotal moment.” Heather summarizes this record as midway between
  the world-weariness they’ve always felt\, and the helplessness of watch
 ing the world be dismantled from a screen: “I’m feeling a little frust
 rated with the timeline being during the pandemic\, because i feel like i 
 would’ve written a record about the same things. We’re reaching a brea
 king point: from an ecological perspective\, from a socioeconomic perspect
 ive: we’re already in crisis. The pandemic has made it feel different be
 cause we’ve been forced to sit and do nothing\, and watch… that’s an
  apocalypse. It’s not when robot dogs shoot us in the street: we’re al
 ready there. It’s that weird intersection of doing nothing and feeling e
 xhausted about how little we can do.” If we’re already at an end\, tre
 mbling marks a new beginning: one where the planet and people interact wit
 h failing systems\, recognize sinister natures hiding in plain sight\, and
  one where we understand how to stare down evil forces with realism and te
 nacity.words by James Cassar\nADDY\naddy is a Philadelphia based project t

 7PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nCOME\n \nCome is a cult American
  alternative rock band\, formed in Boston by Thalia Zedek (vocals\, guitar
 )\, Chris Brokaw (guitar\, vocals)\, Arthur Johnson (drums)\, and Sean O
 ’Brien (bass).Brokaw and Zedek had been introduced by a mutual friend in
  Boston shortly before Zedek moved to New York to join legendary noise roc
 kers Live Skull in ’86. They stayed in touch\, and Brokaw briefly played
  in Zedek’s side project Via before forming the influential slowcore gro
 up Codeine.\n \nZedek and Johnson first met in the fall of 1988 while on t
 our with their respective bands Live Skull and Bar-B-Q Killers. O’Brien 
 and Johnson were long-time friends and former housemates from the close-kn
 it Athens\, GA\, music scene of the ’80s\, where Sean played guitar and 
 then bass in the Kilkenny Cats\, and each of their bands was featured in t
 he 1987 documentary Athens\, GA–Inside/Out.\n \n1990 found all four musi
 cians living in Boston\, and they decided to join forces to see what might
  happen. The musical chemistry was immediate\, and it wasn’t long before
  the band had its first show and a recording offer from Sub Pop.\n \nCome
 ’s first release was “Car” b/w “Last Mistake\,” the August 1991 
 installment in the first volume of Sub Pop’s Singles Club. The single ma
 de them one of the most highly touted new acts on the underground scene\, 
 and there was more than one label eager to release the band’s first full
 -length effort. Come chose Matador in the US and Placebo in the UK to put 
 out their debut album Eleven Eleven in 1992. The album was a great success
  with both critics and fellow musicians\, and tours followed with Nirvana\
 , Dinosaur Jr.\, Sugar\, and Pavement\, among others. Pitchfork has called
  it “one of the most elusive gems of the Matador catalog”. After the r
 elease\, Brokaw left Codeine\, devoting himself full-time to Come.\n \nCom
 e released their second album\, Don’t Ask Don’t Tell\, in 1994\, again
  on Matador and Placebo. It was to be the last album recorded with the rhy
 thm section of Johnson and O’Brien. Though somewhat calmer than its pred
 ecessor\, it was equally as grave. Among the highlights of the album\, and
  of the whole of the band’s impressive song catalogue\, are the two dark
  ballads\, “Let’s Get Lost” and “Arrive\,” each closing a side o
 f the vinyl edition. Brokaw and Zedek’s emotional dual guitar work rival
 s Verlaine/Lloyd\, chiming and majestic\, cascading into feedback-ridden s
 qualls informed by both punk and metal\, sifted through one of the tightes
 t rhythm sections ever assembled.\n \nCome’s third record\, 1996’s Nea
 r Life Experience\, was recorded with two different rhythm sections: Tara 
 Jane O’Neil and Kevin Coultas from the now-legendary Louisville band Rod
 an\, and Chicago’s Mac McNeilly (The Jesus Lizard) and Bundy Brown (Tort
 oise). It was released on Matador in the United States and on Domino in Eu
 rope.The band’s final release\, 1998’s double album Gently\, Down the 
 Stream\, was again released on Matador/Domino and featured a new rhythm se
 ction of Daniel Coughlin on drums and Winston Braman on bass. After extens
 ive touring on the release in both Europe and the States\, the band went o
 n hiatus\, and both Brokaw and Zedek pursued solo careers and other musica
 l collaborations.\n \n \n \nSUN ORGAN\n \nPhiladelphia\, PA\n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\nMO TROPERMo Troper is truly one of a kind\,
  and that’s never been more apparent than on his fifth full-length\, the
  winkingly titled MTV. Arriving hot on the heels of his 2021 full-length\,
  Dilettante\, the album finds the Portland\, OR-based power pop extraordin
 aire diving further into home-recorded immediacy to make a record that fee
 ls like a strikingly direct conduit to the world of Mo–where heartbreak\
 , hilarity\, and hooks allgo hand-in-hand. “My third record\, Natural Be
 auty\, was super labored over\,” Troper explains. “It was the total op
 posite of where I am now. It cost a lot of money and took a lot of time\, 
 and it just wasn’t really rewarding by the time it was done. So I’ve b
 een less interested in doing that process again.” Most of MTV was writte
 n during\, or in the immediate aftermath of\, a lengthy tour and then quic
 kly captured at home on an 8-tracktape recorder. “I’m just really inte
 rested in writing songs–that’s the most fun part for me\,” he says. 
 “So when it comes to recording\, I think the first pass is usually best.
  The more attempts I make\, the more sterile things become. I’m just kin
 d of pushing that mentality even further now”\n2ND GRADERinging from hi-
 fi headphones and blown-out boombox speakers alike comes the overloaded gu
 itar genius of Easy Listening\, a record of rock ‘n’ roll daydreams an
 d terminal boredom\, and 2nd Grade’s long awaited second LP on Double Do

  respite. Like the Blue Angels touching down on the Las Vegas Strip\, Eas
 y Listening is impossible to ignore. And like a janitor mopping up beer o
 n the floor of the Hollywood Palladium in 1972\, hours after the Rolling S

 y Listening knows the glory and cost of escapism\, abandon\, and the soul

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nWESTERMAN\n \nUK artist Westerman
  returns with his first offering in two years with the song “Idol\; RE-r
 un” out via Partisan Records. The new track\,produced by James Krivcheni
 a and Westerman\,juxtaposes gentle and celestial sonics with an aggrieved 
 disposition and features artwork by renownedNew York via Portugal Graphic 
 Designer and Illustrator Bráulio Amado. The song was written after Wester
 man emergedfrom a period of disenchantment with making music\, and with th
 e future of his career feeling abstract\, it seemed unclear to Westerman w
 hether the material he was recording would ever be heard. Creatively\, thi
 s offered a strange kind of freedom\, and accommodated some of the most ad
 venturous and unselfconscious songwriting of his career. Finding textures 
 became a central concern taking programming and looping into his own hands
  in a way he never had before\, creating polyrhythmic grooves to lend urge
 ncy to his inner dialogue.”Idol\; RE-run” is the first taste of songs 
 written in this period and provides a hint for what’s to come from Weste
 rman in the coming year. The track featuresJames Krivchenia\, Mikel Patric
 k Avery and Booker Stardrum on drums\, Ben Reed on bass\, Luke Temple on s
 ynth\, Mat Davidson on piano\, Robin Eubanks on the trombone and of course
  Westerman on vocals\, guitar and synth.Speaking about the new song\, West
 erman shares:”The lyrics to the song were written around the same time a
 s the storming of the Capitol. The compulsion towards the pedestal is stro
 ng. The need to scapegoat and revere without logic. Our populists actively
  celebrate their being people who don’t know anything other or better th
 an anyone else\, yet these spectres with their failings conduct our anger 
 and resentment as if they were gods. They are nothing more than the shadow
  of something else\, the face fronting a need to be loved or revered prese
 nt in everyone. And there will always be another face to front.”\nTWAIN\

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nNARROW HEAD\n \nTruly great pop s
 ongs do not require a cheery outlook in order to work\, nor do they pander
  to expectations of syrupy sweet easy-listening. Rather\, the best pop mus
 ic is a matter of refinement and pure intention\, of dialing groove to mel
 ody so that the two might puncture the malaise of everyday living in uniso
 n\, revealing some brief\, sober truth about our shared human condition. O
 n their third LP\, Moments of Clarity (Run for Cover)\, Narrow Head have a
 chieved precisely this feat. Traversing the depths of massive\, churning r
 iffs\, often distorted to the point of violence\, bouncing\, lock-grooved 
 rhythms\, and crystalline\, gorgeously constructed hooks\, the Houston-bas
 ed outfit puts on a masterclass in the art of writing songs that match the
  pain\, pleasure\, and confusion of modern living. Each track is sentiment
 al without being precious\, heavy without unnecessary griminess\, pop-forw
 ard without letting the listener off the hook easy: these songs ask for so
 me form of hurt or desire to be paid back to them in return\, some promise
  that the listener is putting equal skin into the game.\n \n \n \nGRAHAM 
 HUNT\n \nWisconsin Musician Graham Hunt’s latest effort\, “If You Knew
  Would You Believe It?” (Smoking Room Records) is a journey that confide
 ntly tackles pop/rock from every possible sonic angle.  Hunt’s penchant
  for combining wistful melodies with lyrics that make stagnant moments fee
 l improbably vivid compliments an increasingly refined incorporation of 
 ’90s and early ’00s alt-rock touchstones. Through all of the familiari
 ty\, Hunt has managed to develop a style that feels authentically singular
 \, an honest extension of his tastes\, preferences\, and experiences.\n \n

 \n \n9PM – Show\nPINE BARONS\n \nThe band’s debut LP\, The Acchin Boo
 k (released in 2017)\, possessed a unique quality from the auxiliary inst
 ruments and recording techniques used\; feathered paper dragged across pai
 ntings\, field recordings in the woods at night\, accordion\, string arran
 gements and bowed guitars all contributing to the various moods and textur
 es of the record.\n \nIt was praised by Consequence who noted: “their co
 mplex arrangements echo the type of perplexing subject matter at hand\, an
 d their metaphorical lyricism sees them evoking a world beyond reality in 
 hopes of finding the right answers”.\n \nPine Barons’ follow up effort
 \, 2020’s Mirage on the Meadow\, released during the throes of the pand
 emic\, was a more insular effort\, as all songs were written\, produced an
 d engineered by frontperson & multi-instrumentalist\, KC Abrams\, who expl
 ored themes of human connection while acknowledging impermanence and death
 ’s inevitability. Sonically\, Mirage on the Meadow is a psychedelic am
 algamation of graveyard shifting indie rock – full of the dread we all e
 xperience while retaining a cautious optimism that propels its rich\, colo
 rful sound towards a brighter future.\n \nDuring the mixing process\, Abra
 ms stumbled upon the music of cult favorite Japanese band\, Fishmans (act
 ive throughout the late 80’s and 90’s) and fell in love with their pee
 rless mix of dream pop\, psychedelic rock\, trip-hop and dub/reggae. Unabl
 e to speak the Japanese language himself\, Abrams set out to discover what
  the lyrics actually meant\, and with the help of a Japanese-speaking frie
 nd\, came up with lyrical English interpretations of the late Shinji Sato
 ’s words. After Sato’s copyright successor passed along his blessing t

 tribute album in the truest sense. Also produced and engineered in house\,
  Pine Barons brings its own flavor to the arrangements and compositions th
 at comprise nine Fishmans songs\, including ambitious fan favorite\, the 
 30-minute plus “LONG SEASON”\, a song that has never been attempted as
  a cover before. Abrams recalls hearing Sato’s voice for the first time\

  port of call is cloudy and indistinct. It’s while traveling along these
  nebulous contours that their latest album The Sun Still Seems To Move for
 ms a kind of physicality\, of outstretched giving hands\, that offers a gu
 ide through the fog. Here\, Moser examines the disorien- tating\, challeng

 aze that evokes senses of desolation and chaos that unfurl around him. Tom
 ’s always been fascinated by visual signs of desolation\, observing the 
 abandoned century structures in his Philadelphia neighborhood and dreaming
  up stories of what they must have been. It’s through this narrative pra
 ctice of archiving that Tom explores figures outside of himself after dedi
 cating Swim Camp to autobiography and confession.\n

  world wasn’t built with most people in mind. For those who exist on the
  fringe\, you learn to pave your own way\, foster your own community\, and
  create your own joy. As a queer person and a daughter of migrants\, Lahey
  learned how to adapt to a world that wasn’t made for her\, and her thir
 d album\, The Answer Is Always Yes\, examines how she finds comfort in the
  discomfort\, whether it’s reveling in absurdity or turning towards expl

 come about indirectly\, almost in passing\, a feeling of being in-between 
 things. I was really mobile at that time\, living wherever. Half the songs
  came through in a week. “Jordan” perhaps the most out of the blue… 
 sitting there as I was on my brother’s couch in Austin. But I guess I do
 n’t think that anything comes from nowhere. Everything is writing to me.
  A grad professor once told me that masturbation is writing\, as long as y
 ou’re looking out a window.\nI had just discovered\, late\, Raymond Carv
 er Broadcast\, Sibylle Baier (which “Tonight” is more or less dedicate
 d to)\, Annette Peacock\, Richard & Linda Thompson\, a short story called 
 “Car Crash While Hitchhiking” by Denis Johnson. I had “Heart Needs a

 ugh the world\, hanging in the shadows of the people I wanted to be. Hopin
 g\, looking out\, this is Optimism. I was looking for anything.\nIn 2018\,
  I took these ten songs into a studio in Austin with some members of the b
 and Knife in the Water. I’d been singing with them at the time and it fe
 lt right. My friend Ian\, who I’d been performing with as a duo for a fe
 w years\, was with me on drums. “Friends Again” and “Jordan” were 
 written in the process. “Jordan” was such an outlier\, I thought: I ca
 n’t put this on the album. Then at some point in the recording process\,
  decided to embrace it—the question of whether spiritual themes should b
 e a part of my work—which wouldn’t even be a question now. It’s in e
 verything. But at the time\, you know\, it was the first time\, and so the
  song kind of scared me\, like I was a mule for it instead of its owner.\n

 ’s music is based on evoking mood\; their vivid arrangements utilize tim
 e and space to build soundscapes that invite the listener into their world
 . The quintet’s distinct sound pulls from 70s film scores\, the funkier 
 side of jazz\, and the samples that form the foundation of hip hop. They p
 ush the boundaries of instrumental soul and funk with their own approach h
 oned by countless hours in the studio\, studying the masters\, and perhaps
  most importantly\, the ‘tyranny of distance’ that dictates a unique p
 erspective to their music. Hailing from just outside of Melbourne\, Austra
 lia\, their first two albums\, All News Is Good News and Daylight Savings 
 amassed a die-hard fanbase and brought their sound from their home studio 
 to every corner of the globe. The band is now signed to Big Crown Records\
 , joining a lineage of contemporary and classic sounds that have influence
 d Surprise Chef’s music since their formation in2017. Surprise Chef is L
 achlan Stuckey on guitar\, Jethro Curtin on keys\, Carl Lindeberg on bass\
 , AndrewCongues on drums\, and Hudson Whitlock—the latest member who doe
 s it all from percussion to composing to producing. Their self proclaimed 
 “moody shades of instrumental jazz-funk” have a bit of everything: pun
 chy drums\, infectious keys\, rhythm guitar you might hear on a Studio One
  record\, and flute lines that could be from a Blue Note session. But when
  you step back and take in the entirety of their sound and approach\, you

 8PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nSTUCK\n \nWorking at a mixing bo
 ard one night\, a catchphrase popped into Greg Obis’ head: “freak freq
 uency.” He was ringing out feedback during his job as a sound engineer\,
  and started to picture the parallels between acoustic physics and politic
 al trends. “If you think about a waveform\, as the frequency rises\, the
  space between the sine waves gets less and less\,” Obis explains. “Wi
 th that downward trend comes constant heightening\, stress and tension.”
  He came to see freak frequency as an apt metaphor for the decline of West
 ern empire\, an inverse relationship between the (positive) deterioration 
 of American hegemony and the (negative) worsening of daily life under that
  fall. It was a fitting title for the new material Obis was planning for S
 tuck\, the frenetic and twisted post-punk outfit he formed in 2018. Inspir
 ed by the doomy social economics of Mark Fisher’s Capitalist Realism\, t
 he bleak worldbuilding of horror games Demon’s Souls and Bloodborne\, an
 d the bombastic yet arty satire of Devo\, Obis channeled his audio analogy
  into Freak Frequency\, an album ringing out with explosive sounds and ide
 as. Though its songs tackle the violence of wealth\, the nightmares of tec
 hnocracy\, and the rise of the conspiratorial layman\, Freak Frequency is 
 Stuck’s quirkiest record to date—compositionally challenging and equip
 ped with menace\, yet dotted with vibrant fun. “Being in a brooding post
 -punk band isn’t that appealing to me\,” jokes Obis. “When things ar
 e bad\, all you can really do is laugh.”\n \n \n \nMESH\n \nPhiladelphi

  exists. Previous works have been recorded on a 4- track Tascam Portastudi

 s. On this upcoming release the recording process has changed quite a bit.
  Echo In the Memory was recorded on an Otari Broadcast MX50/50 – a 4 tra

 ks\, drum samples & loops were produced on an all black MPC1000 except\, 
 “Fragmented Pulse” which used the classic DR-55 with an 8/12 bitcrushe

 d along with guitar & bass with various effects pedals. Recorded over a tw

 ltro’s sophomore album crystallizes those dreams and experiences into a 
 post-rock manifesto of dazzling beauty. Its songs combine touches of shoeg

 American folk–the purity of stringed instruments\, supple syncopated per
 cussion and elusive melodies that define the works of Latin American legen
 ds such as Violeta Parra\, Víctor Jara and Atahualpa Yupanqui. From the p
 ropulsive\, chant-like groove of “Guanaco” to the art-pop panache of 
 “All the Time in the World\, ”Underbelly is the kind of record that in
 vites you to quiet down and listen\, savoring every single detail.The albu
 m reaches an emotional pinnacle during its second half\, when the majestic
  lament of “Softy”– seeped in exquisite cushions of reverb–segues 
 into the hypnotic reverie of “Kerosene.” It also signals a new chapter
  in the fusion of Latin roots with mainstream rock\, anchoring its sonic q
 ueston a rare commodity: inspired songwriting.\n

 bums of expertly crafted pop punk\, Remember Sports follows up last year
 ’s epic Like a Stone with the first EP of their decade-long run. Recorde
 d piece meal in their respective homes\, sometimes together\, sometimes ap
 art\, Leap Day trades the live immediacy of their studio classics for some
 thing cozier\, though no less rousing. The core trio of Carmen Perry\, Cat
 herine Dwyer\, and Jack Washburn have always kept up active home recording
  practices for their solo projects–Carmen as Addie Pray\, Catherine as S
 pring Onion\, Jack under his own name–and here we find them gently foldi
 ng sounds sprung from their bedrooms into their signature brand of basemen
 t rock. Absent a dedicated drummer for the first time in their recorded hi
 story\, the band opts for simple drum machine accompaniment\, lending the 
 music a fresh weightlessness even as Carmen’s arresting vocals and sharp
  lyrics bring gravity in all their righteous anger\, scathing self-reproac
 h\, and disarming tenderness. Musically\, all the thrilling guitar riffs a
 nd grooving bass lines we’ve come to expect are here\, but the gradual r
 ecording process offered the band more opportunity to explore and experime
 nt\, adding on subtle layers of instrumentation\, distortion\, and electro
 nics\, and with them a warm sense of depth. In all\, Leap Dayis a short an

 and continuation—a celebration of spiritual survival pulsing with the be
 at of all things tropical. In July of 2022\, faced with the passing of co-
 founder and bandmate\, Sumohair\, Reyna made the decision to continue in s
 olidarity with the band’s founding vision to be a voice and a platform f
 or the joy and injustices living within the spectrum of Queer Love & Afro-
 Mexico. Today Fabiola Reyna is accompanied by what she calls “The Tropic
 al Collective / La Colectiva Tropical.” A relationship between herself a
 nd fans\, friends\, musicians\, DJs\, and producers committed to uplifting
  the culture of the tropical diaspora\, and creating spaces where Black\, 
 Indigenous and Queer joy can thrive.\n

 c at the fringes for over four decades. Flashes of reggae\, bursts of nois
 e\, guitars that rattle\, shake and snake\, born out of a gutter behind CB
 GBs. The band’s first iteration lasted just a few years\, from 1979 thro
 ugh the early ‘80s. But they respawned time and time again\, contorting 
 their sound\, tweaking the vision\, remaining completely singular and indi
 spensable along the way. In the late 2010s the group—Pat Place\, Cynthia
  Sley\, and Dee Pop—reformed again\, releasing an EP\, Take the Fall\, i
 n 2018. It was their first offering of new music in over a decade. A few y
 ears later in\, 2021\, they released a career spanning box set called Rhyt
 hm and Paranoia. The New York Times called the box set an artifact that 
 “proves for decades [that the Bush Tetras] continued to evolve in surpri
 sing yet intuitive directions.” And in Pitchfork’s Best New Reissue\, 
 Rhythm and Paranoia revealed “just how vital [the Bush Tetras] remained 
 each decade.” \n \n \n

 e Scranton\, Pennsylvania-based band Tigers Jaw\, is an ode to living in t
 he present. As this hectic era of distraction whirrs\, ticks\, swipes\, an
 d scrolls by each of us at an alarming speed\, the ability to maintain a s
 ense of priority for the human elements in our lives as well as a reflecti
 ve understanding of self\, remains a lost art. But here\, the group has se
 ized upon it. Tigers Jaw’s sixth album—and first for new label home Ho
 peless Records—finds members Ben Walsh (vocals/guitar)\, Brianna Collins
  (vocals/keyboards)\, Teddy Roberts (drums)\, and Colin Gorman (bass) at t
 he height of their powers\, fusing their collective skills with the synchr
 onicity and energy the band honed over several years of non-stop touring. 
 The result is a back-to-the-basement approach elevated by the unmistakable
  production of their longtime friend and collaborator Will Yip. The band
 ’s most sonically ambitious and lyrically affecting album to date\, I Wo
 n’t Care How You Remember Me sees a newfound freshness and creative free
 dom crystalizing the lush and dynamic world of Tigers Jaw.\n \n \n \nYOWL

  being a part of the loud pop outfit All Dogs as songwriter\, and long-tim

 d-apocalyptic world it can feel like a waste of time to speak about time a
 t all. Why dwell on the past when we could just live in the present becaus
 e the future won’t shut up about how bad it’s going to be? But with T
 his Is The Kit\, the pseudonym of songwriter / banjo strummer / pinhole ca
 mera lover / Winchester UK born Paris dweller Kate Stables\, we’re going
  to have to give time just a modicum of consideration. Because not only is
  Kate still here and making albums of cataclysmic honesty and welcoming to
 nal embraces\, they are continuing to grow\, which is probably the only sm
 art way to move forward through time\, unless you’re one of those shrink
 ers.\n \n  This Is The Kit’s music places companionship at a premium\,
  so being welcomed into its space feels like an obvious privilege\, on rec
 ord and in concert hall with her stellar supporting cast of Rozi Plain (ba
 ss)\, Jamie Whitby-Coles (drums) and Neil Smith (guitar).  And at this cu
 rrent point in our confusing history\, continuing to be here at all\, to s
 tand tall and make music to gather to\, that’s a heroic act. Joyful surv
 ival as an act of time-wasting\,  I’ll take that any day of the week. L
 ook to This Is The Kit to spend at least one day of your week this year\, 
 I guarantee it will be time well wasted.  \n

 ke a kid: experimenting\, having fun\, and trying to discover new things a
 bout this work\,” says Pile’s Rick Maguire about All Fiction. It’s h
 is band’s eighth record\, and one that finds the ambitious group assembl
 ing its most texturally complex material yet—despite the fraught inspira
 tion underscoring its restive lyrics. Alongside the blistering drums and s
 corched-earth riffs that first galvanized Pile’s dedicated fanbase\, the
  band has incorporated elegiac strings\, mystifying vocal corrosions\, and
  haunting synths. From the creeping fear of cinematic opener “It Comes C
 loser” to the euphorically ascending keys on ego-shattering closer “Ne
 on Gray\,” All Fiction is an ornate\, carefully paced study on the subje
 ctivity of perception\, the data-shaping despotism of big tech\, and the c
 onnections between anxiety and death. In its most vital moments\, it’s a
 lso a resolute recommitment to the restorative significance of art and ima
 gination.\n \nFor fifteen years\, Pile’s evolving take on rock has earne
 d the group one oft-repeated superlative: “your favorite band’s favori
 te band.” Ceaseless touring took its members from Boston’s basement ci
 rcuit to international festivals\, hitting loftier technical apexes with e
 ach new record. Maguire—the fastidious composer\, evocative guitarist\, 
 and potent voice behind the solo-turned-punk project—gives musical body 
 to his interior world in scream-along-able lyrics that skew surreal. \n

 open about it.  Founded by guitarist/singer Jon Ginoli and soon joined by
  bassist/singer Chris Freeman\, with the intent of forming a gay rock band
 \, Pansy Division blew the closet doors open. Raised on a diet of 60s pop 
 and 70s punk\, their sound was suitably crunchy and catchy as hell. They w
 rote in-your-face lyrics\, but did it with a sense of humor. Not only did 
 their music and stance defy stereotypic norms of rock musicians being open
 ly gay\, they also broke gay cultural stereotypes that rock wouldn’t int
 erest gay people.\nTHE RITCHIE WHITE ORCHESTRA \nThe Ritchie White Orches
 tra is a hard rocking poppy psychedelic trip to Detention Hall. Music for
