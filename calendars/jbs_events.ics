DESCRIPTION:\n*All events are 21+ valid ID required for entry*\n \n8PM –
  Doors9PM – Show\n \nISLANDSIf Islands’ last record\, (2021’s Isloma
 nia) was a Saturday Night Fever dream\, then the follow up–And That’s 
 Why Dolphins Lost Their Legs–is the Sunday Morning comedown. “[Isloma
 nia] was exuberant and hopeful\, and Dolphins is like the grim rejoinder\,
 ” songwriter Nick Thorburn says. “The songs attempt to tap into some o
 f our darker impulses. The grim\, unshakeable feeling that we live in hell
 \, that there is no future\, that all hope is lost. I wanted to explore th
 ose depths and see where it lead me.” Hopelessness aside\, the collecti
 on of songs represents a big leap forward. With addictive hooks at every p
 ossible turn\, Dolphins (the 9th record in the catalogue)\, stands out as 
 quite likely the strongest and most articulate Islands album yet. Nick Tho
 rburn and band manage to slyly tap into both the pain and the joy of livin
 g\, often simultaneously\, while stripping the music down to its simplest 
 element: a strange sample rubbing up against a bouncing bassline\, a snapp
 y kick and snare firing off against a persistent\, hooky guitar line. The
  music itself is settled on the spaces in between: the silences\, the spar
 eness. There’s an evocative wooziness within each song\; a disorienting 
 disassociation that draws you into its strange world.\nKIWI JR.Refracting 
 the realities of late-capitalist city life and the impossibility of work-a
 rt balance in a high-rent metropolis through satire and sarcasm\, Toronto
 ’s Kiwi Jr. has shaped their own deadpan postmodern indie rock. Their th
 ird album\, Chopper\, overseen by producer Dan Boeckner (Wolf Parade\, Han
 dsome Furs) was release on Sub Pop Records in Summer 2022.\n

 wave cult favorite Exposure EP in 2019 on Avant! Records\, their acclaimed
  full length\, New Earth\, exploded onto the scene with its graceful touch
  of 1980s-influenced club elements\, contagious rhythms and the powerful p

  anticipated second LP\, Love Lines\, Nuovo Testamento continues to explor
 e the light\, the dark and the exultant personal power in what will undoub
 tedly become an instant dance classic.\n \nLove Lines is an album about pr
 oof of life and the joy of survival. Vibrant with Italo disco and Hi-NRG c
 elebration\, and born amidst years of pandemic uncertainty and restriction
 \, the record invokes a sense of motion in an otherwise stagnant time and 
 place. Inside the eight new tracks\, rich synthesizers and driving percuss
 ion testify to the need for movement\, connection and autonomy.\n \nProduc
 ed by sound engineer Maurizio Baggio (Boy Harsher\, The Soft Moon and many

  Doors8PM – Show\n \nRatboysRatboys have been recording and releasing mu
 sic for over a decade\, but their newest album\, The Window\, marks the fi
 rst time they’d ever traveled outside their home base of Chicago to make
  a record\, journeying to the Hall of Justice Recording Studio in Seattle 
 to work with producer Chris Walla. The sessions with Walla (Death Cab for 
 Cutie\, Tegan and Sara\, Foxing) struck the perfect balance between prepar
 ation and experimentation\, injecting new life into the band’s style of 
 soft-hearted Midwestern indie rock with an ever so subtle Americana twist.
  The solidified Ratboys lineup stretched and expanded their vision in the 
 studio\, adding unexpected elements and instruments like rototoms\, talkbo
 xes\, and fiddles. The result is Ratboys’ most sonically diverse record\
 , shifting wildly from track to track. It flexes everything from fuzzy pow
 er pop choruses on “Crossed That Line” and “It’s Alive!” to a wa
 rm country twang on “Morning Zoo” to mournful folk on the titular trac
 k. After more than ten years and four studio albums\, The Window finally c
 aptures Ratboys as they were always meant to be heard—expansive while st
 ill intimate\, audacious while still tender—the sound of four friends op
 erating as a single\, cohesive unit.\nFree RangeFree Range’s music makes
  mature confessionals feel as simple as flicking on a light switch when th
 e sun starts to set. Jensen’s delivery is gentle\, even when their lyric
 s are untangling stormy thoughts. It’s a kind of openness and ease heard
  in Jeff Tweedy’s or Ben Gibbard’s writing\, unveiling comfort in dark
  truths. Here\, Jensen discusses memory loss as a consequence of self-dest
 ruction rather than lack of attentiveness. “I let you think that it was 
 accidental\,” they sing in the first verse. “When I stopped caring abo
 ut being careful.” Loss of time and events indicate a loss of something 
 much more—a sense of self.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:\n*All events are 21+ valid ID required for entry*\n \n7PM –
  Doors8PM – Show\n \nHAND HABITSThere is a moment halfway through Hand H
 abits’ Fun House at which musician Meg Duffy asks the question\, “How 
 many times must I rewind the tape?” It’s a fitting question planted sq
 uarely in the middle of a sonically adventurous record concerned largely w
 ith making sense and taking stock. How much time must we spend examining o
 ur own past in order to fully understand it? How can we safely acknowledge
  pain in order to release it and fully actualize who we are supposed to be
 ? Buffeted by strings\, synths\, and a gently-shook tambourine\, the aptly
 -titled track\, “The Answer\,” highlights the emotional engine at the 
 heart of the record. “I know t… Duffy sings\, “Here’s what I hope 
 to find – it’s always mine.”Fun House is Duffy’s most ambitious Ha
 nd Habits album to date. Produced by Sasami Ashworth (SASAMI) and engineer
 ed by Kyle Thomas (King Tuff)\, the record was not intended as a reaction 
 to the pandemic\, but it was very much the result of taking a difficult\, 
 if much-needed\, moment of pause. “When the pandemic happened\, everythi
 ng stopped\,” recalls Duffy. “I had been touring consistently for five
  years\, both on my own and playing in other people’s bands\, so I wasn
 ’t really writing a lot in between. It had been full pedal to the metal 
 in terms of traveling and scheduling\, which meant I really didn’t have 
 a lot of time to think about how I felt or really check in with myself. Th
 en\, when the world basically stopped\, it turned out to be the longest I
 ’ve been alone in my entire life – without being in a relationship\, w
 ithout being on the road\, without working myself to exhaustion – and th
 e result was really like\, holy shit. I slammed on the brakes and everythi
 ng psychologically that I’d been pushing down and ignoring for the past 
 few years suddenly flew to the foreground.”What started out as a very pe
 rsonal reckoning eventually blossomed into a fruitful and convenient means
  of making new music. Grounded in LA and sharing a house with Ashworth and
  Thomas\, who also runs a studio space in the building\, Duffy began to fl
 esh out the songs that would eventually become Fun House. Emboldened by go
 ing into therapy and coaxed by Ashworth to push the songs into unexpected 
 new shapes\, the resulting music was more acutely personal and stylistical
 ly adventurous than anything they had attempted before. The new songs also
  became a prism through which Duffy could begin to self-actualize in a new
  way.\nALLEGRA KRIEGER“I Keep My Feet on the Fragile Plane” – Allegr
 a Krieger’s fourth record and her first with Double Double Whammy – is
  her most mature and alluring work yet. It contains all the signatures of 
 her best lyricism: delicate and precise phrasings\, moments that flicker b
 etween beauty and banality\, meaning that forms through the accretion of o
 bservations\, memories\, and unexpected adages. This is an album that is a
 t once post-theistic and devoted to a relationship with the divine\, each 
 song blinking in and out of “the fragile plane\,” a place Krieger desc
 ribes as “a middle ground in the universe\,” both abstract and peacefu
 l\, where time\, bodies\, and names don’t exist. \n

 ildhood friends [Judson] Kolk and Ebersole\, the band traversed a variety 
 of monikers\, sounds and members over the years until 2018 when the band r
 e-founded with the arrival of Mcfaul\, [Von] Kolk and Pickard. Fontana\, w
 ho had worked closely with the band in the past\, joined a couple years la

 CER Grocer is a band from Philadelphia. Lead by three distinct vocalists\,
  they pendulate between moments of brash atonality\, saccharine pop sensib
 ility\, and rhythmic acrobatics. Their compositions are both meticulous an
 d volatile\, while their live performances are lauded for explosive chemis
 try with cheeky curiosity. On their most recent full length Number’s Gam
 e the band rearranged the puzzle pieces of 90s-influenced rock and dissona
 nt pop into something utterly their own. Now building on a landscape of po
 lyrhythms and chromaticism that their fans have grown to cherish\, they ex
 plore new sonic structures in their forthcoming EP Scatter Plot. Across it
 s six tracks\, Grocer reiterates they are just as comfortable with glassy 
 earworms as they are with angular dissonance. They remain giddy\, furious

 nd’s first iteration lasted just a few years\, from 1979 through the ear
 ly ‘80s. But they respawned time and time again\, contorting their sound
 \, tweaking the vision\, remaining completely singular and indispensable a
 long the way. In the late 2010s the group—Pat Place\, Cynthia Sley\, and
  Dee Pop—reformed again\, releasing an EP\, Take the Fall\, in 2018. It 
 was their first offering of new music in over a decade. A few years later 
 in\, 2021\, they released a career spanning box set called Rhythm and Para
 noia. The New York Times called the box set an artifact that “proves for
  decades [that the Bush Tetras] continued to evolve in surprising yet intu
 itive directions.” And in Pitchfork’s Best New Reissue\, Rhythm and Pa
 ranoia revealed “just how vital [the Bush Tetras] remained each decade.

  Doors9PM – Show\n \nMAPACHERoscoe is a road dog. The 14-year-old Boston
  Terrier has been there for the whole ride of Mapache\, Clay Finch and Sam
  Blasucci’s band\, which has grown from being the casual project of two 
 longtime buds to one of the most formidable cosmic-folk acts around. “Ro
 scoe’s been through a lot of shit\,” says Blasucci\, the dog’s forma
 l owner. “He’s been all around the country\, come on tour a little bit
 .” With some bemused pride\, Finch points out that\, for a few years\, h
 e and Blasucci bunked together in a room in the Echo Park neighborhood of 
 Los Angeles that was just big enough to fit two twin beds. “It was the t
 wo of us and the dog\,” he laughs.Naturally\, Roscoe has found himself t
 he subject of a good handful of Mapache songs in the past—and on Roscoe
 ’s Dream\, the band’s third LP of originals\, he takes center stage. (
 That’s him in quilt form on the album cover.) “I Love My Dog” opens 
 up the album with a blissed-out stack of acoustic guitars and a lyrical ex
 planation of one of Roscoe’s many talents: “I love my dog / Keepin’ 
 the policeman out.”Just as much an easygoing trip with Gram Parsons into
  the desert as a mad dash with the Grateful Dead away from the law\, Rosco
 e’s Dream is the purest distillation yet of the distinct Mapache sound\,
  which has been brewing for many years now. Finch and Blasucci first met a
 s students at La Cañada High School\, just north of Los Angeles: “There
  wasn’t much supervision or anything\,” remembers Blasucci. “It was 
 really nice. And we got to just play guitars together.”The two stayed fr
 iends through their college years—Finch went to Chico State and Blasucci
  spent two years as a missionary in Mexico—and eventually they ended up 
 back in L.A.\, spending their days playing guitar together once again\, ju
 st like old times. Working with producer/engineer Dan Horne (Cass McCombs\
 , Allah-Lahs)\, they recorded two albums of originals (2017’s Mapache an
 d 2020’s From Liberty Street) as well an album of covers\, 2021’s 3. O
 ften trading solos\, and occasionally switching from English to Spanish\, 
 Finch and Blasucci are now a well-oiled machine.\nJOHNNY PAYNEJohnny Payne
  is in it for the music. He’d much rather be in the public ear than the 
 public eye. So we’ll just introduce him to you and let his new album spe
 ak for itself. Johnny spent much of his 20’s in The Shilohs. He wrote a
 nd produced more than half of the band’s material that contributed to 3 
 full length albums and an assortment of other releases. Since leaving the
  group a few years ago\, he has been producing\, recording for film and qu
 ietly releasing his own music. One such release was the much loved “John
 ny” EP\, which was recorded and co-produced by Alaina Moore and Patrick 
 Riley of Tennis. Johnny has always had a keen ear for melody\, harmony an
 d production but he has also always been a performer. He can play just abo
 ut any instrument you hand him and he usually takes care of all the vocal 
 parts too. Johnny has been laying low the past couple of years but his la
 test album\, “King of Cups” is all Johnny Payne. He wrote it\, arrange
 d it and produced it\, and we can tell you\, it’s his best work to date.

  Doors8PM – Show\n \nCIVICOne of the most exhilarating bands to emerge i
 n recent years\, CIVIC have reimagined the reckless intensity of proto-pun
 k for an era of endless uncertainty. On their 2021 debut album Future Fore
 cast\, the Melbourne-based five-piece offered up a barrage of songs matchi
 ng their frenetic sound with both self-aware outpouring and incisive obser
 vation of the world around them—a dynamic that’s earned massive critic
 al acclaim as well as admiration from the likes of punk legend Henry Rolli
 ns. As further shown on their upcoming sophomore full-length Taken By Forc
 e—an album the band aptly sums up as “1984 meets Endless Summer”—C
 IVIC joyfully obliterate the line between furious catharsis and unbridled 
 fun\, introducing a vital new energy into today’s musical landscape.  H
 ailed by Stereogum as “an unholy lo-fi pile-up of garage rock\, punk\, a
 nd ’90s-style noise-rock\,” CIVIC inject every song with a visceral ur
 gency hinting at their shared history in the local hardcore scene. As fron
 tman Jim McCullough recalls\, the band first took shape back in 2017\, whe
 n he and a friend dreamed up a musical project inspired by iconic Australi
 an punk acts like Radio Birdman and The Saints. “We were in a bowling al
 ley in Japan and came up with a very strong focus for what the band could 
 do\, which was take that three-chord ’70s punk sound but get a little mo
 re thoughtful with the melodies and songwriting\,” says McCullough. Upon
  returning from Japan\, McCullough soon recruited a full lineup featuring 
 Lewis Hodgson and bassist Roland Hlavka. Within six months\, CIVIC had ban
 ged out their debut EP New Vietnam—a powerhouse 2018 release that prompt
 ed Vice to crown the band “Melbourne’s New Kings of Wild Rock And Roll
 .”\nDION LUNADONBorn in Auckland\, New Zealand and now residing in New Y
 ork City\, Dion has played in various bands\, most notably The D4\, who re
 leased two albums on legendary New Zealand label Flying Nun Records and A 
 Place To Bury Strangers\, appearing and writing on their studio albums Wor
 ship (2012) Transfixiation (2015) and Pinned (2018) as well as numerous si
 ngles and EPs. He also played in the formidable Flowers Of Evil beside mem
 bers of Crocodiles. While taking a break from touring wit h A Place To Bu
 ry Strangers\, Lunadon recorded a self – titled solo album encompassing 
 all that he loves about rock ’ n ‘ roll. Previewed by the single ” C
 om/Broke\,” Lunadon’s LP arrived in 2017 on Agitated Records. Just as
  the pandemic hit early 2020\, Lunadon decided to leave A Place To Bury St
 rangers and focus on his own music. In June 2020\, he released the song 
 “ When Will I Hold You Again ”\, a duet with Kate Clover\, and Septemb
 er 2020 saw the release of the “Schreien” EP. In 2021 he put a band t
 ogether to give his songs life and in 2022 Henry Rollins got him in touch 
 with In The Red Records who released his sophomore album Beyond Everything

 was standing on a stage in Philadelphia in early 2023 when the latest bit 
 of bad news arrived: His grandfather\, a native of that very city\, was de
 ad. It wasn’t entirely unexpected. For years\, Tommy Burt had struggled 
 with early-onset dementia\, slipping away a bit more each time Burt saw hi
 m. Burt even began recording his grandfather\, letting his tape recorder r
 oll as they had some of their final conversations. He wanted to preserve t
 hose moments\, however repetitious or fragmented they might be\, before th
 e opportunity vanished forever. In fact\, Traffic Fiction—Burt’s third
  album on Oh Boy Records and an unexpected musical reinvention rooted in h
 is new and idiosyncratic version of classic soul—also preserves their re
 lationship by committing another key piece of it to tape. The soul that an
 imates so many of these 14 tracks? That was the music shared by grandfathe
 r and grandson.Burt’s California childhood was not easy. His parents spl
 it when he was young\, so he would often shuttle between their houses in S
 acramento and the Bay Area. He was a bit of a wild child\, too. From time 
 to time\, though\, he would accompany his father to work at a plant nurser
 y\, riding shotgun in a 1975 Cadillac Seville as they listened to The Delf
 onics and Otis Redding\, Marvin Gaye and The Temptations. Those drives wer
 e his sanctuary\, that music their blessed score. But as Burt became a mu
 sician himself\, he was a peripatetic troubadour\, tapping into American f
 olk and blues partly as a matter of necessity—it’s not sensible to bus
 k\, after all\, with some sophisticated band at your back. Bits of those o
 ther roots and compositional ambitions finally emerged on 2021’s You\, Y
 eah\, You\, the vivid result of Burt’s first proper studio sessions. On 
 Traffic Fiction\, they are in full bloom\, from the sweet country-soul sur
 realism of the title track to the skywriting rock of “2 For Tha Show\,
 ” Burt as urgent and commanding as he’s ever been. Traffic Fiction is 
 the sound of Burt confidently bending a sentimental past to his present wi
 ll.\nSKYWAY MANOn his third voyage as Skyway Man\, artist + producer James
  Wallace is still seeking answers beyond the stars and still coming back w
 ith more questions in the form of ten brilliant songs. On its surface\, Fl
 ight of the Long Distance Healer registers as another concept album replet
 e with aliens and alternative philosophy\, but this time around\, Wallace 
 coats the glass with a vital layer of self-reflection.Like a West Coast Dr
 . John—but more preoccupied with flying saucers than voodoo dolls—Skyw
 ay Man is in the business of opening new aural worlds\, cracking open real
 ity just enough to get the message through. Flight of the Long Distance He
 aler sparkles and blinks\, whispers and moans—hugely enjoyable music ren
 dered in imaginative and gleaming style. There are hints of the polyrhythm
 ic cinematic sensibility from Wallace’s contributions to the Joe Pera te
 levision series\, rhythms of the Stax-inspired Spacebomb house band\, and 
 ripples of the current East Bay scene outside San Francisco. In a real sho
 wcase for the extended Skyway Man family\, Wallace has coaxed personal and
  masterful performances from the likes of Erin Rae\, Vetiver’s Andy Cabi
 c\, Molly Sarlé\, pedal steel wizard Spencer Cullum\, Kelly McFarling\, a
 nd more. Cooking up genres in such a way as to keep their nutrients intact
 \, he packs prog\, blues\, glam rock\, acid folk\, swamp boogie and future

 HOLYLIGHTEmpty surrounds all of me . It’s a poignant line from the third
  album by Blackwater Holylight that encapsulates the search for self when 
 suddenly everything has changed. There’s a theme of processing vast pers
 onal trauma throughout Silence/Motion that eloquently — both lyrically a
 nd musically — and simultaneously embodies the crushing emptiness\, sorr
 ow\, strength and rebuilding of recovering from personal devastation. “T
 here was so much grief both in the world and interpersonally during the pr
 ocess of creating Silence/Motion \,” says vocalist/bassist Allison “Su
 nny” Faris. “The four of us gave one another more space to be ourselve
 s\, to experiment with each other’s ideas and to be gentle with one anot
 her more than we ever have before. So\, we knew this tenderness would mani
 fest in extremely honest arrangements\, and I think that you can hear that
  throughout the record.” Curiously\, considering the dark times in which
  it was created\, this is the band’s most melodic and catchy music so fa
 r. Blackwater Holylight\, as the name suggests\, is all about contrasts: I
 t’s a fluid convergence of sound that’s heavy\, psychedelic\, melodic\
 , terrifying and beautiful all at once. And\, Silence/Motion finds the ban
 d honing those contrasts\, letting ideas and moods fully develop from song
  to song\, rather than filling every song with a full range of their capab
 ilities. It allows the band to go fully prog-rock here\, and simply stay h
 ushed and intimate there. There’s a new confidence to the band in how se
 amlessly they wield their stylistic amalgam.\nSONJASounding like a heady m

 bout this work\,” says Pile’s Rick Maguire about All Fiction. It’s h
 is band’s eighth record\, and one that finds the ambitious group assembl
 ing its most texturally complex material yet—despite the fraught inspira
 tion underscoring its restive lyrics. Alongside the blistering drums and s
 corched-earth riffs that first galvanized Pile’s dedicated fanbase\, the
  band has incorporated elegiac strings\, mystifying vocal corrosions\, and
  haunting synths. From the creeping fear of cinematic opener “It Comes C
 loser” to the euphorically ascending keys on ego-shattering closer “Ne
 on Gray\,” All Fiction is an ornate\, carefully paced study on the subje
 ctivity of perception\, the data-shaping despotism of big tech\, and the c
 onnections between anxiety and death. In its most vital moments\, it’s a
 lso a resolute recommitment to the restorative significance of art and ima
 gination.\n \nFor fifteen years\, Pile’s evolving take on rock has earne
 d the group one oft-repeated superlative: “your favorite band’s favori
 te band.” Ceaseless touring took its members from Boston’s basement ci
 rcuit to international festivals\, hitting loftier technical apexes with e
 ach new record. Maguire—the fastidious composer\, evocative guitarist\, 
 and potent voice behind the solo-turned-punk project—gives musical body 
 to his interior world in scream-along-able lyrics that skew surreal. \nCO
 R DE LUX\nCOR DE LUX grew out of the music scene of North Carolina’s Out

 about a love of music between its two founding members (guitarist Tim Lusk

  something that wasn’t as widespread in the international\, and even les

  album “Indhentet af døden” during the winter of 2008/2009\, supporte
 d by having played a variety of local shows in the Danish capital region. 
 The debut album eventually got released in January 2010 by the UK based ne
 wly founded label Me Saco Un Ojo Records and a little later the Spanish la

 k celebrates ten years of their beloved record\, Limits of Desire\, with a

  companion Real People EP. The band is also headed out on tour in the US i
 n October to play the record in full\, along with other favorites from the
  catalog. After starting off in their Long Island attic\, Small Black lef
 t the Brooklyn warehouse scene & toured the world extensively. Written\, r
 ecorded\, and mixed by Small Black at their home studio in Brooklyn over t
 he whole of 2012\, Limits of Desire is a more widescreen shot of the intim
 ate synth-pop of Small Black’s first few releases. “We went on a real 
 vision quest for this LP\, making double-digit versions of some tracks\, a
  few you’ll hear on the reissue\,” adds singer Josh Kolenik. Limits o
 f Desire has become the quintessential Small Black LP over the decade sinc
 e its release\, accruing 100m+ streams and fueling hundreds of concert dat
 es across the world. The iconic cover art of a couple on a ladder above an
  alligator\, taken by artist Scarlet Hooft Graafland\, has become the sour
 ce material for many fan tattoos. Bolstered by the success of singles “N
 o Stranger” and “Breathless”\, Limits of Desire laid the road map fo
 r celestial\, sophisticated pop: for Small Black\, for their contemporarie

 n extended family of musicians from Fishtown\, Philadelphia. Founded in la
 te 2019 by lead singer\, James Everhart\, after 6 years on the road as Low
  Cut Connie’s lead guitar player\, The Guilt have merely existed as a re
 cording project during the long quarantine of 2020 with only two sold out 
 shows under their belts. As venues began to open in 2021\, The Guilt hit t
 he ground running with a string of sold out “debut” shows.\nIn May 202
 2\, The Guilt released their first\, self-titled album to great reception.
  The band spent their first year out of the pandemic performing with great
 s like White Denim\, Father John Misty\, Sharon Von Etten\, Charlie Crocke
 t\, and Jenny Lewis. By the end of the year\, “Cosmic Guilt” was named
  top 25 albums of 2022 by WXPN. Lead singles\, “Cautious Lovers” and 
 “Sun In Your Eyes” are lush folk orchestrations with Spaghetti Western
  and British influence – think Lee Hazelwood meets Fairport Convention.\
 n“Queen of the Dream”\, a folky electric jangler\, is The Guilt’s la
 test single to promote their new record\, “Palace of Depression”\, set
  to be released in late 2023/ early 2024.\n \nNo one is doing it like Cosm
 ic Guilt. Anywhere. Wrap yourself in it and let it give your zeal – guil

 2023\, 31-year-old Brittany Ann Tranbaugh (pronounced TRAN-baw) finally qu
 it her office job to pursue a full-time music career. Though she began wri
 ting songs and playing gigs as a teenager\, multiple bouts of creative and
  mental health struggles—culminating in a several years-long hiatus from
  music altogether in her mid-to-late 20s—prevented her from ever taking 
 the full leap. Everything changed in 2021 when her longtime friend Jackson
  Emmer called her up and implored her to come out to Colorado and record h
 er backlog of original songs with him. Tranbaugh hit the road and spent a 
 week with Emmer in his home studio\, resulting in Quarter Life Crisis Hai
 rcut\, her comeback EP released in April 2022. Bouncing between witty sarc
 asm and heartbreaking vulnerability\, the songs tackled a wide range of to
 pics including her sixth grade queer awakening\, an awkward run-in with an
  old acquaintance\, and the impossibility of true folk music authenticity 
 in our modern age. Listening back to the finished product\, she began to f
 eel the flickers of confidence again. \n \nIn July 2022\, Tranbaugh’s q
 ueer Americana heartbreaker “Kiss You” was awarded Song of the Year in
  the John Lennon Songwriting Contest\, which came with a $20\,000 cash pri
 ze. She used the money to fly her band out to Los Angeles to record five s
 ongs with Grammy-winning producer Tyler Chester (Madison Cunningham\, Marg
 aret Glaspy\, Watkins Family Hour)\, which proved to be a life-affirming t
 rip. In March 2023\, Tranbaugh released the first song from this new batch
 \, the exuberant long-distance-relationship anthem “Can’t Wait No Rush
 .” Listeners can expect three more singles this summer and a self-titled
  EP in the fall. The new songs showcase Tranbaugh in her new era: energeti
 c\, self-assured\, surrounded by her beloved musical community\, and more 
 commanding as a vocalist and writer than ever before.\n\n\n\n\n

  acclaimed 2019 release Tainted Lunch\, and injects it with a slightly mor
 e polished\, ‘80s funk sound\, kind of like stumbling home to your squat
 ted loft after a drunken night at the local disco. It’s crunchy on the o

 e music Warmduscher have ever graced us with.“There was a lot of partyin
 g\,” says Clams\, laughing about the gestation of the album. “We were 
 like\, Aaarrggghh. We were just happy to be doing something and seeing eac
 h other. It was that weird energy\, where you’re fed up and you’re kin
 d of angry\, but in a good way. We would spend like two nights a week writ
 ing\, maybe once or twice a month\, sometimes less.” This went on for ab
 out a year\, with all the members bringing in their contributions\, until 
 it came time to record—which\, in typical punk rock fashion\, had its ow
 n set of obstacles to overcome.The bulk of Warmduscher’s discography –
  the aforementioned Tainted Lunch\, as well as 2018’s Whale City and 201
 6’s Khaki Tears – were produced by London stalwart Dan Carey\, who was
  instrumental in helping the band hone their fuzzed out sound. Unfortunate
 ly\, at the beginning of At the Hotspot’s recording process\, Dan caught
  COVID\, and the band found themselves having to leave their comfort zone 
 and find a new producer fast. Luckily\, they found two\, under serendipito
 us circumstances. “I was in the studio with Joe and Al of Hot Chip\, doi
 ng an electronic project with Igor Cavallera of Sepultura and his wife\, a
 rtist/musician Laima\,” explains Clams. “When I got the message saying
  Dan couldn’t do the album\, I was like\, ‘Aw\, fuck!’ Then Joe and 
 Al were simply like\, ‘We’ll do it!’ It was this really weird\, happ
 y accident.”While At the Hotspot is still very much a Warmduscher album\
 , with all its cracks and crevices oozing garage rock bravado\, the produc
 tion values buff out those jagged edges in a way only these two virtuoso p
 roducers could have pulled off. “We’re just really psyched to play thi
 s whole thing live now\,” states Clams matter-of-factly. “And it’s a
  whole revamp—new label\, new producers\, new logo—new everything.”\

 n gay musicians hidden throughout rock music history\, but Pansy Division 
 when began in 1991 in San Francisco\, they were the first to be so boldly 
 open about it.  Founded by guitarist/singer Jon Ginoli and soon joined by
  bassist/singer Chris Freeman\, with the intent of forming a gay rock band
 \, Pansy Division blew the closet doors open. Raised on a diet of 60s pop 
 and 70s punk\, their sound was suitably crunchy and catchy as hell. They w
 rote in-your-face lyrics\, but did it with a sense of humor. Not only did 
 their music and stance defy stereotypic norms of rock musicians being open
 ly gay\, they also broke gay cultural stereotypes that rock wouldn’t int
 erest gay people.\nTHE RITCHIE WHITE ORCHESTRA \nThe Ritchie White Orches
 tra is a hard rocking poppy psychedelic trip to Detention Hall. Music for 
 bad boys and girls and those in between.\n

 PM – Doors8PM – Show\n \nLEAGUE NIGHTA special night of music curated 
 by Stereo League with opening performances by League members Zavetis\, Gus
 ten Rudolph\, and Keaton Thandi. \n \nSTEREO LEAGUE (10:00 PM)\n\n \n \nF
 ormed in 2016\, Stereo League is driven by the songwriting of childhood fr
 iends Alex Savoth and Dan King. Initially a studio project formed with the
  help of Engineer and Producer Eric Bogacz\, the three began crafting song
 s and recruiting a cast of friends to fill in the gaps. Pretty soon\, The 
 League had grown to a dozen members and the result was their debut album 
 “A Light on Each Side”. Often appearing live as a six-piece band\, the
  group has incorporated influences from a plethora of genres\, both modern
  and classic\, refusing to be boxed in by conventional labels. The outcome
  is an ever-changing musical landscape that continues to evolve along with
  their line-up.\nOn their last EP Endless Mirage\, Savoth and King collabo
 rated with the Synth & Soul record label and production crew Eraserhood So
 und. The result is a timeless\, shimmering collection of songs that tell e
 vocative tales of loneliness and longing\, set against the backdrop of Era
 serhood Sound’s signature analog production. Stereo League\, who was pre
 viously named Artist to Watch by Philadelphia’s WXPN\, believes this rel
 ease to be the clearest and best representation of their vision to date—
  delivering the soulful sound they have been searching for.\n \n \n \nThe
  collaboration with Eraserhood Sound continued in the fall of 2022 with tw
 o additional singles. “Seasons of Trouble” and “Operator\, Please”
  were released on their second 45 and feature vocal performances by Turquo
 ise Cobb who joined the band’s line-up late in 2021. The League is now p
 reparing for the release of their next LP Perfect Paradise. \nZAVETIS (9:

 me of the songs feel pretty rock and roll. There’s a looseness and an en
 ergy to the 11-song batch\, with electric guitars and barroom piano and a 
 good groove on the kit. It has some nice harmonies\, too\, the tight kind 
 you’d expect from four friends who’ve been singing together for a deca
 de. The songs are really good ones. You’ll want to keep singing them lou
 d in the car and in your head while you walk around the supermarket. They 
 may stick with you for a while. \nPALMYRAEstablished in the Shenandoah Va

 , three part harmonies and foot percussion. In 2022\, Palmyra made their N

 ner\, and performed over 200 tour dates on acclaimed stages up and down th
 e East Coast. The trio captures the collective spirit of three Virginia na
 tives\, Teddy (he/him)\, Manoa (he/him)\, and Sasha (they/them). Palmyra
 ’s songs are intimate and contemplative\, with arrangements that allow t
 hem to create the illusion of a full\, larger-than-three ensemble. The tri
 o’s sound is a nod to Appalachia and Midwestern Americana\, apparent thr
 ough their stirring craftsmanship and dedication to a folk-driven\, innova

 e is messy. Change is messy. Perhaps\, change is the messiest of them all.
  Especially when eyes are on you\; when you blast out of adolescence onto 
 stages across the country\, then into your twenties\, onto more stages and
 \, finally\, into your thirties—all on those same stages. The stages tha
 t Lydia Loveless has sung her heart out on\, has collapsed on\, and laughe
 d on\, all mirror the stages of her life thus far for the world to see. Wh
 en Loveless released her first album over a decade ago\, she was still a t
 eenager whose songs of debauchery\, guzzling alcohol and doing cocaine wer
 e an audio wet dream for a certain type of listener who not only wear thei
 r music tastes on their (tattooed) sleeve\, but in the lifestyle that they
  emulate: “outlaw” music with brains – akin to Steve Earle\, Drive-B
 y Truckers and Lucinda Williams\, vintage country heart with a heartland r
 ock soul.In the end\, the music industry is still sadly a man’s world an
 d\, as such\, Loveless grew up in the spotlight (or perhaps\, more accurat
 ely\, the bar lights) while she was placed on a pedestal. Her voicemail gr
 eeting is a tongue-in-cheek ode to this: “Hi\, this is Lydia Loveless\, 
 savior of cowpunk. Please leave a message and I will get back to you.” T
 he time between their late adolescence to now is defined by a shelf full o
 f records\, hundreds of thousands of miles on the road\, and a ribbon of h
 eartbreaks pockmarking their trail. Loveless is a fiercely brave writer wh
 o bluntly assesses their life in song: their struggles with alcohol and de
 pression\, and the uncertainty of not only the future\, but what piecing t
 ogether the past will mean for the present. \n

 ayed on last year’s re-recorded retrospective EP\, Pictures Of The Sun

 ’s history that that’s happened. This goes even deeper. It’s the fir
 st time that Ayotte has written a love song that’s not about love going 
 or having gone wrong. Quite the opposite\, in fact.\n \n“It’s written 
 not from the perspective of having lost love but having gained love\,” h
 e explains. “Before\, I didn’t write about any relationships until the
 y were over\, and it wasn’t usually in the most positive way. But this i
 s a positive song I wrote for and about my girlfriend. Even though it says
  the nice things about her\, I decided to keep in the not so nice things a
 bout me – because she’s also signing up for those. Luckily\, she’s l
 oving of both.” \n \nTHE VAUGHNS\n \nEqual Vision Records and NJ/NYC-ba

 y In Heaven is about conquering grief would be oversimplifying everything 
 Tim Showalter has achieved on the eighth studio album from Strand of Oaks.
  A stunning\, hopeful reflection on love\, loss\, and enlightenment\, In H
 eaven is a triumph in music making\, and a preeminent addition to the Stra
 nd of Oaks discography.In late 2018\, Showalter’s wife\, Sue\, lost her 
 mother in a car accident. Soon after\, Stan\, the cat they both adored\, w
 as diagnosed with terminal cancer. Showalter quit drinking so he could tak
 e better care of his wife and help rebuild the life they shared. And withi
 n months\, they decided to pack up and move across the country from Philad
 elphia to Austin\, Texas. It was an irrational decision made at the height
  of a terrible time\, but it’s one that shaped so much of what In Heaven
  is about.In Heaven was recorded in October 2020 with Kevin Ratterman at I
 nvisible Creature in Los Angeles. Carl Broemel (My Morning Jacket) is feat
 ured on guitar throughout the record\, while James Iha (The Smashing Pumpk
 ins) contributed vocals and guitar for “Easter.” Bo Koster (MMJ\, Roge
 r Waters) provided keyboards\, Cedric LeMoyne (Alanis Morrissette\, Remy Z
 ero) bass\, Scott Moore violin\, and Ratterman monstrous drums. Showalter 
 also played a lot of synth on this record\, which he hasn’t done since 2
 014’s HEAL. With clean sounds\, Jeff Lynne-esque acoustics\, and sophist
 icated songwriting\, he approached In Heaven in a more poised and pop-lean
 ing way than his past releases.\n

 – Doors8 PM – Show\n \nzzzaharaPlenty of people come to Los Angeles lo
 oking to make their California dreams a reality. But zzzahara has always b
 een here\, turning reality into a dream. Born and raised in Highland Park\
 , where they still reside\, zzzahara (the solo moniker of Eyedress/Simps g
 uitarist Zahara Jaime) has witnessed both gang-blighted and gentrified L.A
 . along the same geographical blocks. Like the transforming city itself\, 
 zzzahara has undergone massive personal changes\, their characteristic sto
 icism giving way to a newfound sense of purpose. Liminal Spaces\, their de
 but LP from Lex Records\, explores a life hanging in the balance between m
 emory and possibility over frenetic Johnny Marr-esque guitar jangle.Music 
 has always been an escape for zzzahara\, who struggled to feel seen as the
  sibling of a terminally ill brother. Z found solace in bands like My Chem
 ical Romance\, the Cure\, the Ramones\, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs\, and in recor
 ding “corny acoustic parodies” about girls they had crushes on in midd
 le school. That same absurdist humor followed them into early projects lik
 e bombastic hip-hop persona Lil Boba and post-punk quartet Zahara & the He
 rd\, though as a queer person of color\, zzzahara still felt out of place 
 in SoCal’s bro-ish garage rock scene.But over time\, zzzahara’s inner 
 circle crystalized around talented\, prolific friends. They became touring
  guitarist for Eyedress after meeting Idris Vicuña in 2018. That partners
 hip spawned collaborative duo The Simps\, whose first single “On Fye” 
 has already racked up more than five million streams. Stones Throw enginee
 r Collin Davis helped zzzahara expand their production techniques\, and th
 e pair recently formed electronic post-punk project U.S. Velvet\, releasin
 g their first single in October 2021. All the while\, zzzahara demoed song
 s like others might keep a diary. Some\, like “Sugar Gay” and “Xxxst
 asy\,” became stand-alone singles\, while others were collected for Simp
 .Wav\, the four-song debut EP zzzahara released in 2020.Signing to Lex Rec
 ords\, zzzahara bumped up production values for Liminal Spaces\, enlisting
  industry vets Dave Cooley for mastering and Steve Kaye for mixing. Some o
 f the songs have been with Z for a while\, like “Julia\,” written when
  zzzahara was just sixteen about their experiences with manipulative girlf
 riends. Others are inspired by queer culture\, absurdism\, love\, lust\, a
 nd feeling lost. Evolving stylistically\, maturing emotionally\, and yet s
 till attached to a past scorched by trauma and old flames\, zzzahara bring
 s pop sensibility and hi-fi quality to Liminal Spaces that makes their wor
 k appealing to anyone and everyone: young and old\; straight and queer\; i
 ntroverts and extroverts\; the hardened L.A. locals and the daydreaming tr
 ansplants.\n
