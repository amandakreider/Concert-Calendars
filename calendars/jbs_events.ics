 arists Tom Malach and Danny Arakaki\, the band took a few years to find th
 eir flying shape\, solidifying into a lineup with Danny’s brother Cesar 
 on drums and Derek Spaldo on bass by mid-2016. Ramping up their accelerati
 on around the time of their 2018 Cosmic Cash debut on Beyond Beyond Is Bey
 ond Records\, they’ve blasted through residencies and new songs and sess
 ions and collaborations\, relocating to New York\, picking up two new memb
 ers in keyboardist/multi-instrumentalist Pat Gubler and bassist Andy Cush\
 , and leaving a trail of live tapes in their wake. This year\, they’ve d
 elivered not one but two new albums for BBiB: the sleek and song-oriented 
 Natural Facts and the sprawling improvisatory opus of One Step Behind. 201

 9PM – Show\n \nKATE BOLLINGER\n \nKate Bollinger’s songs tend to linge
 r well beyond their run times\, filling the negative space of ordinary day
 s with charming melodies and smart phrasings. She writes them at home in R
 ichmond\, Virginia\, letting her subconscious lead\, an open-ended process
  she likens to dreaming. From a chord progression appears a line\, maybe a
  syllable will start to stick\, enough to pursue\, but she says sometimes 
 the words don’t feel like her own\, more like shapes that form in the mi
 nd’s sky. While many are personal and dealwith the emotions that surface
  with finding her place in the world\, she’d prefer they be whatever you
 ’d like them to be\, to connect with listeners in their own way. Bolling
 er’s musical universe is relaxed\, tender\, and unassuming\; within live
 s a timeless sensibility\, a songwriter’s knack for noticing the little 
 things and their counterpoints. Darkness and light\, pain and pleasure\, r
 eality and escape. These all have space to be seen on her new EP\, Look at
  it in the Light\, her first project on Ghostly International\, arriving i
 n spring 2022.\n \nLAEL NEALE\n \n \n \n \n

 l launch their very first tour dates in the United States this upcoming Ju
 ne\, beginning in Los Angeles on June 11th and concluding in Boston on Jun
 e 21. The tour follows critical acclaim for their third album Nature of Th
 ings\, released in January 2021 on Middle-Class Cigars.    The band’s 
 latest full-length record was named by NME as the best Asian release of 20
 21\, who wrote that Nature Of Things “takes big swings… but it does so
  with a decided unshowiness\, and scatters small pearls to savour along th
 e way.” Further international acclaim followed from Bandcamp – who nam
 ed Nature Of Things as their Album of the Day\, praising its “gleaming h
 ooks that hit exuberant heights\, doled out in compact\, pulse-escalating 
 bursts” – and acclaimed director Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz\, Baby Driver)
 \, who placed key album cut “Fruitcake” on his end-of-year favourite t
 racks list\, alongside tracks by indie staples Unknown Mortal Orchestra\, 
 Big Thief and Turnstile. The album’s rousing reception further earned Su
 bsonic Eye video performances on international platforms\, including KEXP

 ND GRADE\n2nd Grade began as a passion project\, inspired by the childlike
  openness and excitement of early power pop singles. Over two weekends\, G
 ill recorded every instrument of Wish You Were Here Tour to garageband i
 n a friend’s carpeted bathroom\, starting with drums. In 2020\, 2nd Grad
 e released the 24-track LP Hit to Hit on Double Double Whammy with a ban
 d of Philly all-stars including members of Remember Sports\, Friendship\, 
 and 22 degree halo. Now\, the five-piece band has re-recorded eight songs 
 from Wish You Were Here Tour. Along with remastered versions of the orig
 inal fourteen and one outtake\, they will make up Wish You Were Here Tour
  Revisited\, a document of the band’s past\, present\, and future. 2nd G
 rade’s past is Pete Gill on a friend’s futon\, layering guitars with a
  zoom recorder on his day off. Lo-fi guitar riffs and snarky jokes are bro
 ken up by sincerity and tenderness. The future is a nonstop rush of guitar
 \, harmony\, and gratification. Both versions of the Wish You Were Here T
 oursongs develop the 2nd Grade ethos: childhood wonder\, experimentation\,
  guitar hooks\, and having as much fun as possible before you die.\n

 8PM – Show\n \nSHEER MAG\n \nSheer Mag’s dizzying rise initiated in 20
 14\, when the Philadelphia band self-released the first of three 7-inches 
 and started playing the Northeastern DIY circuit. Ironically\, the music s
 tood apart because it sounded so familiar. Indebted to ‘70s arena rock\,
  power-pop\, and proto-metal\, Sheer Mag’s songs reminded a lot of us of
  the music we grew up with\, but maybe couldn’t relate to because it was
  big\, brash\, and unapologetically macho. Sheer Mag reclaimed some of tha
 t energy without perpetuating the toxicity. On their debut album\, Need to
  Feel Your Love (2017)\, the band surveyed their contemporary political la
 ndscape through the lens of history. Singer Tina Halladay transported hers
 elf back to the 1969 Stonewall Riots\, denounced redlining practices that 
 undermine the popular vote\, and paid homage to White Rose activist Sophie
  Scholl. On paper\, it’s a mouthful\, but accompanied by guitarist/lyric
 ist Matt Palmer\, guitarist Kyle Seely\, and bassist/producer Hart Seely\,
  those songs became hook-laden rallying cries.\nDRAAG ME\nPhiladelphia\, P

  – Show\nBOBBY OROZA\n \nAfter years of grinding as a sideman in the Fin
 nish music scene\, Bobby Oroza has stepped up to make his voice heard. Alw
 ays with an air of crude romanticism\, Bobby pushes towards an expression 
 transcending the borders of soul and rock balladry. His dark and intimate 
 debut single ”This Love” didn’t take long to reach the ears and hear
 ts of a worldwide soul music community and is already a proper classic amo
 ngst the lowrider and soul collector scenes.Bobby was born in Helsinki\, F
 inland into a family of musicians and artists. During frequent family part
 ies Bobby´s Bolivian grandfather would pick up a guitar and sing Latin ca
 nciones and Cuban classics. Bobby´s mother is a singer and his father a g
 ypsy-style jazz guitarist. All his siblings work in show business and musi
 c. As a kid\, Bobby was lucky to grow up surrounded by his parents’ reco
 rd collection which included early jazz and blues\, Motown hits\, gospel e
 nsembles\, and doo-wop groups like The Drifters and The Clovers. The Soul 
 records were balanced out by Brazilian ones\, African ones\, his mother’
 s collection of North and South American folk songs\, and Nuyorican Salsa 
 albums. All of these influences show up in Bobby’s music.\nBobby started
  working professionally as a musician in his early teens. His main instrum
 ents are guitar and percussion. Before finishing high school Bobby decided
  he needed to experience the rhythmic source that had inspired him the mos
 t\, and travelled to Santiago\, Cuba. There he studied percussion and sing
 ing intensively for months. Since his return he’s been producing\, recor
 ding and performing music to make a living for his family.Teaming up with 
 the Timmion Records house band Cold Diamond & Mink\, led by Jukka Sarapä
 ä\, Sami Kantelinen\, and guitarist/composer Seppo Salmi\, he has a tight
  quartet of musicians to support his vision. With his instant classic\, de
 but album “This Love” Oroza has shared his strange and unique shade of
  Soul with the world\, creating a cult-like following for his sound from F
 inland to sunny Southern California and beyond.\n \nKOLUMBO\n \nSince he w
 as a landlocked Dallas\, Texas kid\, beach culture has held a tropical mys
 tique for pianist/composer Frank LoCrasto. Family trips documented by camc
 order videos\, featuring slinky jazz-fusion soundtracks are etched in the 
 Brooklyn-based artist’s memory. In his mind\, there will always be a fan
 tasyland replete with wicker furniture\, pristine beaches\, swaying palm t
 rees\, the smell of vanilla-scented suntan lotion\, and breathtaking aqua 
 water expanses. \n \nThese days\, LoCrasto uses his imagination\, evocati
 ve musicality\, prodigious chops\, and eclectic sonic palette to create dr
 eamy musical locales. His transporting compositions are genre-defying\, bu
 t loosely informed by the feel of jazz\, ambient music\, Latin\, vibey 196
 0s and 1970s B-movie film scores\, and exotica. LoCrasto has just released
  his soundtrack to the 2012 comedy-drama\, Sandbar\, and\, in 2022\, he wi
 ll issue his first album with his band\, Kolumbo.\n

 9PM – Show\n \nELISON JACKSON\n \nElison Jackson is 5-piece psychedelic-
 folk band led by singer-songwriter Sam Perduta. Based in Philadelphia sinc
 e 2016\, they spent their formative years in the New Haven\, CT undergroun
 d scene. The band has released four albums and several ephemeral bedroom d
 emo mix-tapes and EPs since their 2011 start. In 2020\, they released two 
 singles\, ‘Caught One in the Jaw’ and ‘Home’. Their musical formul
 a is crooned lyrics\, distorted upright bass\, & primitive guitar jams.The
 ir latest record\, ‘Good Deeds’\, was recorded in 2019 by Jeff Zeigler
  at Uniform Recording\, in Philadelphia. It was released digitally in Fall
  of 2021\, and is out on 12″ record in the summer of 2022. The heaviest
  Elison Jackson record to date\, ‘Good Deeds’ expands on their past 
 material and brings their sound to new and exciting heights.\n \nTHE OUT-
 SECT\n \nThe members of The Out-Sect all met while living in a Philadelphi
 a junkyard. On weekends they would gather to drink beers inside a broken d
 own 1982 GMC Caballero with a copy of Back From The Grave stuck in the car
 ’s cassette player. Instantly being drawn to the trashy sounds of those 
 pimple-faced mid-60s punks\, they figured they could write a song half as 
 good as any of them. And that’s just what they did! Using instruments th
 ey\, quite literally\, found in the trash\, the band has managed to write 
 a handful of deranged “songs” that will leave you asking yourself “W
 hat is that smell?” and “Dear god\, can they just stop playing!?”\n 
 \nCESCHI\n \n Ceschi Ramos’ music was born out of the worlds of undergr
 ound Hip Hop\, Hardcore Punk & Folk. His version of songwriting may includ
 e machine-gun-speed-raps or emotive ballads inspired by Latin American tro
 ubadours. Over the last decade he has toured North America\, Europe\, Asia
  & Australia. In 2008 he started his own independent label called Fake Fou
 r & has amassed a cult following worldwide. Although it’s difficult to d
 escribe the type of music that Ceschi makes\, it is not difficult to feel 
 the ferocious heart that is behind it all.\n

 8PM – Show\n \nSTEVE VON TILL (OF NEUROSIS)\n \nSteve Von Till has made 
 a life’s work out of seeking the elemental. With a solo discography that
  stretches back more than two decades\, he has toiled in a shadow realm\, 
 peeling back layers of reality in a never-ending search for true meaning a
 nd raw emotion. A Deep Voiceless Wilderness strips back the veil even furt
 her. An achingly beautiful ambient work with neo-classical leanings\, the 
 album is a hallucinatory and elegant rumination on our disconnect from the
  natural world\, each other\, and ultimately ourselves.\n \nFor some liste
 ners\, the album may recall the work of modern composers like Jóhann Jóh
 annsson\, Brian Eno or Gavin Bryars. For Von Till\, it’s about surrender
 ing to the spirit of place—and to the original intent behind his 2020 so
 lo album\, No Wilderness Deep Enough. That album marked a significant firs
 t for Von Till: It was his first solo record without a guitar in hand. Ins
 tead\, Von Till intoned powerful and thought-provoking lyrics over piano\,
  cello\, mellotron and analog synthesizers. A Deep Voiceless Wilderness is
  that same album without Von Till’s words.\n \n“This is how I original
 ly heard this piece of music\,” he says. “Without the voice as an anch
 or or earthbound narrative\, these pieces have a broader wingspan. They be
 come something else entirely and unfold in a more expansive way. The depth
  of the synths\, juxtaposed with the strings and French horn\, have space 
 to develop and allow the listener to imagine their own story.”\nHELEN MO
 NEY\n \nCellist and composer Alison Chesley has been busy since the 2016 r

 8PM – Show\n \nKEVIN DEVINE (9:00 PM)\n \nIn the very first line of her 
 1959 novel The Haunting Of Hill House\, the late author Shirley Jackson wr
 ites\, “No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under con
 ditions of absolute reality.” That conviction is shared by musician Kevi
 n Devine on his upcoming 10th LP Nothing’s Real\, So Nothing’s Wrong\,
  a beautiful\, surreal\, cinematic bedroom-rock fever dream. Its title\, h
 ewn from the chant-sung chorus of lead single “Albatross\,” nods to th
 is. In the face of incomprehensibly desperate struggles\, a new spiritual 
 paradigm is a necessity: “If you’re sinking\, sing along/Nothing’s r
 eal\, so nothing’s wrong\,” sings Devine.\n \nLike Jackson’s observa
 tion\, it’s not an encouragement of retreat\; it’s an inward solution 
 in the name of preservation\, a personal reorientation toward struggle in 
 a collapsing landscape riddled with failed systems and vacant coping mecha
 nisms that breed malignant internalizations.\n \n“Part of what’s so sc
 ary about all of this stuff happening outside of us is so much of it feels
  so surreal and cynical\,” says Devine. “We’ve invested in a version
  of reality that is almost so perverse that it can’t be real. Trying to 
 find a solution to that almost involved seeing the thing as it is and inva
 lidating it to yourself: it’s not that I’m poor\, it’s that capitali
 sm is fucking broken and rapacious. It’s not that I’m not a real man\,
  it’s that masculinity is broken. It’s not that I’m not strong becau
 se I’m not violent\, it’s that militarism has infected everything we l
 ook at.”\n \nThis is the central thesis linking the record’s 11 tracks
 \, which drift between orchestral acoustic indie\, lo-fi psych-folk\, and 
 melodic guitar pop. “They’re all excavating a particular brand of how 
 to operate in a crisis\, spiritual and familial and cultural\,” explains
  Devine. “Rather than a spiritual bypass that tells me I’m being taken
  care of by some invisible architect\, it’s like\, ‘Everything is exac
 tly as it is and a lot of what I invest in actually isn’t real and doesn
 ’t need to be invested in.’ Nothing’s Real\, So Nothing’s Wrong mi
 ght be a little pithy\, but how do I get through today? Sometimes that’s
  the best answer.\nANIKA PYLE (8:00 PM)\nA Queer dreamer born in the Color
 ado prairie to working class parents\, I learned the world with an impossi
 bly tender heart\, a kinship with nature’s splendor\, and a keen grasp o
 f class politics. \nMany know me as the front person in the short-lived b
 ut well-loved Chumped or the feminine exploration power pop project katie 
 ellen. In February of 2021\, I released my first solo record – Wild Rive
 r  - a mix of song and spoken word poetry paying homage to my late father
  who died suddenly in 2019. The record explores failure\, shame resilience
 \, intergenerational trauma\, and how to find hope after grief.  \nI have
  performed on three continents and in 43 of the 50 United States\, recorde

 the first new music we’ve heard from Katie since Free Cake disbanded in

 with her past\, present\, and future. And with the release of her debut al

 ie and her guitar—but with a musical evolution cultivated from years of 
 self-inquiry during which her confidence\, direction\, and self-possession
  bloomed. Whereas Free Cake buoyantly focused on the ecstatic wonders and 
 wounds of youth in real time\, Katie Bejsiuk pans out with wisdom and retr
 ospection that comes with age. The Woman on the Moon is composed of 12 exq

 8PM – Show\n \nTHE AVENGERS\nIn 1977\, The Avengers established themselv
 es as one of the US’s preeminent punk bands. Fusing incisive guitar hook
 s\, explosive rhythms\, and adolescent venom\, the group forged some of th
 e most in-your-face songs of the era. Classics like “We Are the One” a
 nd “The American in Me” earned them a spot opening for the Sex Pistols
  at their final performance at Winterland\, as well as a dedicated followi
 ng that has only swelled during the subsequent years. The number of musici
 ans that count themselves indebted to the sneering indictments of vocalist
  Penelope Houston and the eviscerating chords of guitarist Greg Ingraham c
 annot be overstated. The current line up includes rock-solid bassist Joel 
 Reader (MTX) and the exhilarating drumming of Luis Illades (Pansy Division
 ).\nWhile much has been written about The Avengers in the past four decade

 artin\, 17 or 18\, loaded into a car with friends\, stoned and aimless. Th
 ey’re navigating the suburban sprawl of New Jersey with no destination i

 here’s so many towns you can drive for 15 minutes and have no clue where
  you are\,” he says\, sitting in his home studio in Beacon\, New York\, 
 where he wrote the songs that make up Magic Sign\, the second solo album f
 rom the Real Estate songwriter. \n \nThe result is a set of songs that ba
 lance joyful abandon with late night wistfulness. “Sailboat” hums with
  Yo La Tengo buzziness\; “Merlin” rolls with a gentle strut\; the afor
 ementioned “Corncob” ambles with a golden hued pop elegance. “It was
  a lot of first thought\, best thought\,” he says\, noting the album’s
  improvised guitar solos\, which sounds celebratory and striking. “I wan
 ted to make music I wanted to hear\, in a world that wasn’t so dark and 
 shitty\,” he explains.  \n \nThat hopefulness blooms on the love song 
 “Exit Music\,” which closes the record. “Though we’re not as young
  as we once were/we both know we’ve still got time for sure\,”he sings
  over chiming Feelies electric and acoustic guitars. And that’s the natu

 ” Wide awake\, vulnerable\, and gimmickless\, Friendship won’t hesitat

  grape jelly residue (“Ramekin”) to the site of a demolished cathedral
  (“St. Bonaventure”) to King of the Hill quotations (“Smooth Pursuit
 ”)\, the record’s images craft a symbolic language of high and low Ame

  filtered through a very different lens. One could use Flanafi as a requir
 ed text in the economics of bombast with no reservations. It’s Sly Stone
  drowning in a liquor ocean – it’s Dntel style IDM made with washboard
 s and spoons instead of computers – it’s Colin Blunstone run through a
  chipmunk filter in a hell based on planet IKEA. This shit is weird and it
 ’s beautiful and it’s one of a kind. In an era where regurgitation and
  veneer hold sway\, this young freak is following his oddly sober muse. He
 ’s got the muse cornered and it’s not clear if he’s gonna set it on 
 fire or serenade it. He could do either\, really\, as Simon’s talent is 
 absolutely unparalleled in this new epoch. Rumour has it that each of his 
 fingers is individually sentient. He knows exactly what he’s doing. Soak

 elf-titled debut album unfurled like hazy memories of late night revelries
  in the city center creeping back in on a hungover Sunday morning. Guitari
 st/vocalist Sade Sanchez purred and crooned over jangling guitar chords\, 
 painting pictures of urban exploits\, old American haunts\, and private es
 capades with a master’s austerity. Bassist Irita Pai and drummer Ellie E
 nglish polished the patina of the band’s vintage sound\, adding a full-b
 odied thump and intoxicating swing to the album’s dusty ballads\, ominou
 s invitations\, and sultry rock songs. The album had an air of effortlessn
 ess\, like these songs were written into the fabric of the Western landsca
 pe by some past generation and conjured into our modern world by three pow
 erful conduits. The band readily admits that L.A. Witch was a casual affai
 r and that the songs came together over the course of several years. That 
 natural flow hit a snag when the band’s popularity grew and they began t
 ouring regularly\, so a new strategy became necessary for their sophomore 
 album\, the swaggering and beguiling Play With Fire.\n \nWhere L.A. Witch 
 oozed with vibe and atmosphere\, with the whole mix draped in reverb\, son
 ically placing the band in some distant realm\, broadcast across some unkn
 own chasm of time\, Play With Fire comes crashing out of the gate with a b
 old\, brash\, in-your-face rocker “Fire Starter.” The authoritative op
 ener is a deliberate mission statement. “Play With Fire is a suggestion 
 to make things happen\,” says Sanchez. “Don’t fear mistakes or the f
 uture. Take a chance. Say and do what you really feel\, even if nobody agr
 ees with your ideas. These are feelings that have stopped me in the past. 
 I want to inspire others to be freethinkers even if it causes a little bur
 n.” And by that line of reasoning\, “Fire Starter” becomes a call to
  action\, an anthem against apathy. From there the album segues into the s
 imilarly bodacious rocker “Motorcycle Boy”—a feisty love song inspir
 ed by classic cinema outlaws like Mickey Rourke\, Marlon Brando\, and Stev
 e McQueen. At track three we hear L.A. Witch expand into new territories a
 s “Dark Horse” unfurls a mixture of dustbowl folk\, psychedelic breakd
 owns\, and fire-and-brimstone organ lines. And from there the band only ge
 ts more adventurous.\n \n \n

 slow down. After releasing two cassette EP’s in 2020 (on Popwig and Born
  Yesterday respectively)\, Dummy’s debut full-length album arrives via C
 hicago’s Trouble in Mind Records. Employing pummeling guitars and celest
 ial ambience within the same breath\, the band folds a myriad of reference
  points into their drone-pop style. Influence from ‘60s melodicism and 
 ‘90s UK noise pop can be found woven in with inspiration from spiritual 
 jazz\, Japanese new age\, and Italian minimalism.\n \nDummy dodges the bro
 oding\, dark\, dramatic tropes of contemporary “artistic” music often 
 found in punk\, experimental\, and electronic\, instead insisting on joyou
 s and euphoric sonic palettes. They refuse to be artistically stagnant\, c
 ontinuously shifting their approach to writing across 12 tracks. Shaped by
  performances around Los Angeles in 2019\, songs like “Daffodils” and 
 “Fissured Ceramics” feature relentless driving energy and ample psyche
 delic noise. Elsewhere\, Dummy counterbalances the aggression with meditat
 ive synthscapes focused on sound design and studio experimentation\, like 
 on the motorik “X-Static Blanket”. Finally\, centerpiece “H.V.A.C.
 ” and the album’s final track\, “Atonal Poem”\, seek to synthesize
  these two poles\, offering multi-part journeys through uncharted sonic te
 rritory.\n \nIn contrast to blissed-out instrumentation\, Dummy’s sardon
 ic lyricism examines “the burden of modern life\, consumerism\, environm
 ental collapse\, alienation\, and other anxieties born out of living in th
 is absurd moment in history”. Interior design\, marine pollution\, the p
 sychology of commercial architecture\, and nuclear testing are all feature
 d subjects. Dummy’s restless creativity keeps them moving ever-forward\,
  continuously challenging themselves and pushing their sound into exciting
  and exhilarating places. This is – as the album title suggests – “M
 andatory Enjoyment”.\nLIFEGUARD (10:00 PM)\n \nChicago\, IL\nKNIFEPLAY (

 \, Policy\, was a book of short stories\,” Butler says. “Generations i
 s more of a novel—despairing\, funny\, a little bit epic… A big chunk 
 of this record is asking: What’s my place in American history? What’s 
 my place in America’s present? Both in general—as a participant\, as w

 parent\, musician of some sort\, I guess. What do I do? What can I do? The
  record asks that question over and over\, even if it’s not much for ans
 wers.”\n \nWhile the songs on Generations contain their fair share of dr
 ead and regret\, there is ultimately a lightness that shines through Butle
 r’s music. That brightness is at its most intense when he and his solo b
 and—Miles Francis\, Sara Dobbs\, and Julie and Jenny Shore—perform on 
 stage. Their electricity is palpable throughout Generations\, with the bul

 ol\, Brisbane band The Goon Sax—the trio of Riley Jones\, Louis Forster\
 , and James Harrison\, best friends who take turns writing\, singing\, and
  playing each instrument—have been celebrated for their unpretentious\, 
 kinetic homemade pop. Mirror ll\, The Goon Sax’s third album and first f
 or Matador\, is something else entirely: a new beginning\, a multi-dimensi
 onal eclectic journey of musical craftsmanship that moves from disco to fo
 lk to no wave skronk with staggering cohesion. Gone are the first-person i
 nsecurities of their school days—they’ve been made expansive\, more un
 iversal\, more weird.\n \nOn their debut album\, 2016’s Up to Anything\,
  it was their candid affection and scrappy instrumentation that drew prais
 e\; 2018’s We’re Not Talking was exalted for the same—their massive 
 choruses\, a sharpening of their craft\, then with an addition of horns\, 
 strings\, piano\, and castanets to their guitar/bass/drums.\n \nMirror ll 
 is the result of three years of writing\, and some considerable time spent
  apart: Louis relocated to Berlin and worked at a cinema (he sings in Germ
 an on the track “Bathwater”)\, Riley and James formed an angular post-
 punk band called Soot. All three experimented with abstract\, atonal sound
 s before recapturing the essence of The Goon Sax: “pop melody\,” Louis
  explains. “The first two albums are inherently linked. They had three-w
 ord titles\; they went together. This one definitely felt like going back 
 to square one and starting again\, and that was really freeing.”\n\n\n\n

  – Show\nDave Kiss Presents\nD.R.I.  (10:00 PM)\n \nWe are a punk/metal
  crossover band with our roots set in hardcore. Established way back in 19
 82\, we have about 10 CD’s & 2 DVD’s out on various labels and are con
 sidered to be one of the forefathers of speed metal and thrash punk music.
  We started out in Texas and moved to the Bay Area cause we heard the SF a
 rea had free food at the soup kitchens (from which the classic tune was wr
 itten!!!!!)\nWhen we started our influences were bands like Black Flag and
  the Dead Kennedys. In 1982\, our first release\, which was really a demo\
 , the 22-song 7″ EP\, kickstarted our career as a formidable hardcore ba
 nd. 22 songs in 17 minutes. Blistering fast\, with on-the-dime cuts\, and 
 vocals to match. Said to contain the first grindcore blast ever recorded (
 No Sense). This record was later pressed into an LP\, and was considered t
 o be our first official release even though it was only 17 minutes. The 22
 -song debut eventually was combined with our second release\, 1984’s Vio
 lent Pacification EP\, and came out on CD in the mid-eighties\, when that 
 technology reached indie labels.\nIn 1985 we started to listen to bands li
 ke Metallica & Slayer. Our second full length release Dealing with It\, sh
 owed a progression to the metal side of the music genre. This album also w
 as said to make an impact\, and helped start the crossover movement. “We
  fused together our influences\, and shoved into the DRI mold\, Dealing Wi
 th It is what came out”. DRI went on mixing its own brand of punk metal 
 releasing: Crossover\, Four of a Kind\, Thrash Zone\, Definition\, a live 
 album recorded in 1992\, before releasing Full Speed Ahead in 1996 \; our 
 last full length release. We have been re-issuing our old catalog with bon
 us tracks for the new millennium. We also got a bunch of Live DVD’s in t
 he works\, starting with the 1984 CBGB’s live DVD that came out in 2005.
  Summer of 2016 saw the release of the first new material in years. But Wa
 it..THERE’s MORE came out as a 7″/12″ and CD.\nThe band currently co
 nsists of original core members and song writing team\, Spike Cassidy (gui
 tar) and Kurt Brecht (vocals)\, along with Gregg Orr (bass) and Rob Rampy 
 (drums).We are that band with the skanker in the circle. You know\, the ru
 nning man. The mosher. We appeared on a Beavis & Butthead episode. We also
  held the Guinness Book record for fastest band in the world\, back in the
  day. We played with just about every major band you can name\, and most f
 estivals in our travels around the world for over three decades. We now ha
 ve over 120 DRI songs under our belt\, and still play about 35 or so when 
 we play live.\nHONEY (9:00 PM)Originally\, Honey wasn’t conceived as a f
 ull band project. It was more of a solo projectto serve as “therapy” f
 or singer / guitarist\, Jay Laughlin (Turning Point\, Godspeed). AsJay put
 s it\, “I’ve been playing in bands non-stop since the 8th grade (1986)
 . In 2017\, Ihad a couple of back-to-back shitty situations which put me i
 nto a seriously darkdepression. I thought maybe it was time to take a step
  back from playing in a band andbook some studio time to make a record for
  myself… by myself.” These sessions wouldtake Laughlin back to his roo
 ts — the heavy metal and hardcore music that first caughthis ear and pos
 sessed him to pick up a guitar and write songs in the first place.\n

  – Show\nR5 Productions Presents\nAN EVENING WITH WAND AND GUESTSwith vi
 suals by Mad Alchemist\nWAND Wand formed in late 2013 in Los Angeles\, CA
  and got right to work playing\, writing\, and conceptualizing a contraria
 n path forward–the only viable trail to follow for a rock band that form
 ed in the twenty-teens (and audaciously named itself Wand). The original c
 onfiguration of the band was Cory Hanson (guitar\, vocals)\, Lee Landey (b
 ass)\, Evan Burrows (drums) and Daniel Martens (guitar). This was the grou
 p that recorded the neuroplastic\, dusk-colored Ganglion Reef. Upon heari
 ng it\, the suits at GOD? Records demanded the opportunity to release it\,
  and the rest became irrevocable historical fact in 2014. That debut relea
 se launched a year of furious activity and near-constant touring\, and inc
 luded the recording and release of both their second and third albums: the
  strobing sledgehammer Golem (on In the Red)\, and the psilocybe flicker
  show 1000 Days (on Drag City). During this time\, Daniel left to focus 
 on raising his son\, and the remaining three members of Wand regrouped as 
 a trio\, with an auxiliary fourth piece for tours.\n \nFollowing a dizzyin
 g 100+ dates played in North America and Europe in support of 1000 Days\,
  Wand took a six-month deep breath at the beginning of 2016. Cory put toge
 ther a string laden solo album\, The Unknown Capitalist From Limbo (rele
 ased later that year)\, and Evan focused on writing and touring with his b
 and Behavior. Meanwhile\, Wand’s barely-perceptible pause had a deeper a
 genda—Evan\, Lee and Cory had sensed the need for a new alignment\, a fa
 bulous new mutation of the body Wand. Sofia Arreguin and Robbie Cody were 
 recruited to play keyboards and guitar respectively\, with the intention o
 f reimagining the band’s approach to writing and performance. A period o
 f intense woodshedding ensued\, both in the practice space and on stages a
 round the world\, out of which the records Plum and “Perfume” emer
 ged.\n \nThe writing process that evolved during the tumultuous seasons of
  Plum and “Perfume” incorporated a new emphasis on econo-jamming a
 nd democratic decision-making\; another new method of invention\, another 
 new mode of digestion. Plum dropped in the fall of 2017\, “Perfume”
  in the spring of 2018. With the success of this music\, the band forged 
 on with confidence\, stockpiling dozens of pieces and working them togethe
 r as a unit. They made the most of their 2018\, taking in deep bubbles of 
 time to tinker and experiment with their sound\, using several different s
 paces as well as their own home studio\, and patiently uncovering the exci
 ting alchemical balance that would bring all this work together as a whole
 . By the turn of autumn\, Wand had arrived at the width and breadth\, the 
 breathless wit of their new album—Laughing Matter.\n \nMAD ALCHEMIST LIQ

 9PM – Show\nWXPN Welcomes\n \nS.G. GOODMAN\n“No one escapes the marks 
 left behind when it comes to love or the absence of it\,” says singer-so
 ngwriter S.G. Goodman\, describing the inspiration behind her sophomore al
 bum Teeth Marks. “Not only are we the ones who bear its indentations\, b
 ut we’re also the ones responsible for placing them on ourselves and oth
 ers.”   When the Kentucky native released her debut album\, Old Time F
 eeling\, she was rightly coined an “untamed rock n roll truth-teller” 
 by Rolling Stone. The roots-inflected rock n’ roll record saw Goodman le
 nding her gritty\, haunting vocals to narrate the dual perspectives of her
  upbringing as the daughter of a crop farmer\, and a queer woman coming ou
 t in a rural town.  Now with Teeth Marks\, co-produced by Drew Vandenber
 g (Faye Webster\, Drive-By Truckers\, Of Montreal) in Athens\, Georgia\, s
 he picks up the threads of Old Time Feeling. But where her critically accl
 aimed\, Jim James-produced debut zeroed in on the South\, reframing miscon
 ceptions in slough water-soaked tones\, her latest album pulses with downt
 own Velvet Underground electricity\, shifting its focus inward – though 
 never losing Goodman’s searing and universal point of view. Teeth Marks 
 is what you might get if Flannery O’Connor and Lou Reed went on a road t
 rip.  Drawing influences from the aforementioned Velvets\, as well as Pa
 vement\, Karen Dalton\, and Chad VanGaalen\, Goodman brings 11 powerful vi
 gnettes to life\, with a sound that ventures deeper into indie rock and pu
 nk territory than she ever has before. Though Teeth Marks is a love album\
 , Goodman doesn’t aim her focus on romantic relationships alone. Instead
 \, she analyzes the way love between communities\, families\, and even one
 ’s self can be influenced by trauma that lingers in the body. Teeth Mark
 s is about what love actually is\, love’s psychological and physical imp
 rint\, its light\, and its darkness. It’s a record about the love we hav
 e or don’t have for each other\, and perhaps\, more significantly\, the 
 love we have or don’t have for ourselves. \n \nLE REN \n\n

 the seaside town of Brighton and formed Porridge Radio in 2014 – global 
 recognition has been a long time coming\, after years of self-releasing an
 d music booking their own tours. In those eight years\, Dana has gained a 
 reputation as one of the most magnetic band leaders around with an ability
  to “devastate you with an emotional hurricane\, then blindside you with
  a moment of bittersweet humour” (NME). \n \nBut if Every Bad establish
 ed Dana’s lemon-sharp\, heart-on-sleeve honesty\, Porridge Radio’s thi
 rd album takes that to anthemic new heights. Waterslide\, Diving Board\, L
 adder To The Sky is the sound of someone in their late twenties facing dow
 n the disappointment of love\, and life\, and figuring out how to exist in
  the world\, without claiming any answers. It’s also catchy as hell.\n

 Formed in New Brunswick\, NJ in 2005\, Screaming Females is Marissa Patern
 oster (guitar\, vox)\, Mike Abbate (bass)\, and Jarrett Dougherty (drums).
  Over six albums and more than a decade of music making\, the band has rem
 ained deeply individual and steadfastly DIY. They have also grown into one
  of the most dynamic and devastating touring bands going today.\nOut Febru
 ary 23rd\, All At Once is the trio’s most expansive and imaginative work
 s to date–a double LP that swings between surreal miniatures and solo-he
 avy sprawl. Concision takes a backseat to experimentation\, with arrangeme
 nts meant to evoke the energy and spontaneity of their live shows. It’s 
 music built across a timeline that’s longer than our internet-enhanced m

 erseverance.\nGHÖSH\n \nGhösh is a disco cabal\, a “political party”
  if you dig what we’re saying\, a band– they’re a wild sonic collage
 \, a quasi post-grunge\, post-industrial mash-up\, all wrapped up in the c
 haos and entropic funk of a warped and screwed Public Enemy demo tape and 
 a fax machine shredded in a Cuisinart. Their songs are an iridescent kind 
 of noisy digital alchemy layered in dense charging breakbeats and splatter
 ed in raucous dayglo\, laser-beamed transmissions from the future at the l
 ast protest march of the revolution. \nSymphony Spell (vocals/lyrics) and
  Zachary Fairbrother (various instruments/samplers)\, the two cyborgs that
  form Ghösh\, bonded over their love for jungle\, techno\, rap and nu met
 al to create songs that bang in tantric visions of sight and sound. Their 
 aesthetic is ripped from the screenshots of Republican nightmares and proj
 ected wide in shimmering hologram\, scored by the last dancefloor clearing
  sound blasts from a party on Cybertron\, all couched in the lyrical inten
 sity of a 2008 myspace page co-owned by Audre Lorde and Missy Elliot.\nTHE
  IREThe Ire is a post-punk group originating in Philadelphia\, started by
  guitarist Florence Lin in late 2017. Joined by Ashley Tini (drums)\, Maya
  Brooks (vocals)\, and Daniel Cox (bass)\, The Ire released their demo in
  early 2019\, and have since impressed audiences across the country with t
 heir romantic mixture of rage and passion\; packaged in the nostalgia of a
 n 80s goth and anarcho-punk sound. \n \n \n \nThe release of their debut 
 LP “What Dreams May Come” (June 6th on Play Alone Records) provides a 
 bridge from the early demos into a clear maturation of style and content\,
  as themes such as racial struggle\, societal collapse are echoed from ear
 ly recordings as well as more personal responses to the weight of our curr

  be able to release the album or tour until the world returned to some kin
 d of normality\, the band found their energies quickly spilled over into o
 ther projects. Laura-Mary started a podcast\, Never Meet Your Idols\, with
  her best friend in LA\, interviewing everyone from Zack Snyder to Mark La
 negan to CHVRCHES. It is now about to start its third season. Steven start

 9PM – Show\n \nTROPICAL FUCK STORM\n \nAustralian post-apocalyptic acid 
 punk disco scuzzheads TFS are coming to the US and Canada for the first ti
 me since 2019.  For the last two years they’ve been holed up in a bush 
 bunker pursuing their sonic experiments which have produced 2021’s Deep 
 States album\, and feature film Goody Goody Gumdrops. Tropical Fuck Storm 
 members Gareth Liddiard\, Fiona Kitschin Erica Dunn and Lauren Hammel will
  be bringing their wild\, destructive and unstoppable chaos to the Norther
 n Hemisphere stages performing songs from A Laughing Death In Meatspace (2
 018)\, Braindrops (2019) and Deep States (2021).\n \n“Everyone I could s
 ee\, myself included\, had a smile on their face I’m not even sure was v
 oluntary. The looks on the faces of the crowd after the band had left the 
 stage were ones of awe—multiple mouths were left agape and eyes were wid
 e open\, almost in disbelief. It was a remarkable performance. One that an
 yone in the audience would attest to it being phenomenal. Throughout the e
 ntirety of the set\, down to how the band dealt with their technical issue
 s\, it felt like witnessing the best guitar band in the world” Spectrum

 olland their music has been constantly changing\, always challenging and o

 YMOX are something special. A band fired by electronic music but determine
 d\, always\, to make something that is very much their own. They are uniqu

 ). While the studio recordings are made by William and Sarah alone\, the l
 ive lineup includes Paul Sin (bass) and Philly Peroxide (keyboards/percuss

  of prescribed genre lines\, endeavoring to push past the boundaries of st
