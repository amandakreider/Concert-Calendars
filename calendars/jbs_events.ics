  – Show\nKISSISSIPPI (9:45 PM) \nZoe Reynolds\, who performs as Kississi
 ppi\, can turn a sweet song sour with a sudden\, razor-sharp line turn. Ha
 rnessing self-empowerment to overcome hardship\, Reynolds imbues her songs
  with hope in the face of grief and heartbreak.\n \nOriginally a home reco
 rded solo project for Reynolds to explore her folk songwriting on acoustic
  guitar\, Kississippi cut its teeth touring on Fest-friendly pop punk\, an
 d the project solidified its emo cred supporting third wave genre progenit
 ors Dashboard Confessional. But like her earliest songwriting heroes Cat P
 ower and Liz Phair (who Reynolds describes as “vulnerable and weird girl
  rock stars\, which was something I saw in myself”)\, Kississippi songs 
 transcend genre\, and lend themselves just as well to slick arena-ready pr
 oduction as they do rock instrumentation. After working closely with Phila
 delphia studio mainstay and mentor Kyle Pulley on 2018 debut Sunset Blush\
 , Reynolds felt encouraged to explore the sonic possibilities in electroni
 c-focused pop\, taking inspiration from favorite bands like Beach House\, 
 CHVRCHES and Purity Ring. She learned to produce with studio software Reas
 on\, delving deep into its “fun synth sounds and weird tools” to devel
 op the lushly-layered demos that would inform ‘Mood Ring’.\n \nHIGHNOO

 gan as the solo indie-rock project of songwriter\, Kennedy Freeman. Drawin
 g inspiration from dream pop and alternative rock\, the band effortlessly 
 conjures a soft summer dreamscape out of bitter cold internal winters. Fre

 lyrics that are relatable and heartfelt. \nJULIAN (8:00 PM)\ndc -> phl ind

  is made up of Zach Thomas\, Justin Di Pinto\, Pat Daly\, Shane Trimble\, 
 and Tyler Yoder. Originally started as just a studio band\, it rapidly bec
 ame apparent that these songs were meant to be heard live and loud.  The 
 band made their debut in the Philly metal scene in early 2017 with success
  which was followed up by the recording of their self-titled debut in May.
  With a sound deeply rooted in modern doom metal while still giving a nod 
 to the earliest Sabbath records\, High Reeper’s first offering is driven
  by pounding rhythms\, thick guitars and soaring\, screeching vocals.  Re
 lentless touring of Europe and the US has helped the band focus their soun
 d in a more powerful direction\, driven towards a live audience. The resul
 t is a blend of classic heavy metal with riffs that are even heavier than 
 before. \nDIRTY DEALER – EP Release (10:00 PM)\n \nFormed in 2022\, Dir

 o a more familiar time of psychedelic debauchery and pure rock ‘n’ rol
 l freedom.\n \n\nFLATWAVES (9:00 PM)\n \nFlatwaves is a 4-piece garagegaze
  band based in Philadelphia. Forming back in 2018\, they hung together eve
 n when the world stopped\, and came out of the pandemic with a debut LP.\n
  \n \n \nHaunting\, dreamy and dissonant\, Flatwaves have developed a wal
 l of sound that is equal parts shoegaze\, garage rock\, weird Americana\, 
 dark psychedelia\, and hazy doomgaze. Their music is a nod to David Lynch-
 ian dreamscapes with reverb-drenched guitars\, driving bass lines\, heavy 
 half-time breakdowns\, and cavernous vocals that fade into the abyss.\n \n
  \n \nThis is music that aims for disorientation\, just skirting the coll
 ective unconscious\, and will make you feel like you woke up in a desert m
 otel with no idea how you got there.\n\n\n

 ors8PM – Show\nCROOKS & NANNIES (EP RELEASE)\n \nCrooks & Nannies is a c
 ollaboration between multi-instrumentalists and friends since high school.
  Their signature blend of brash\, confessional indie rock functions on ext
 remes. Alternating between painfully tender and jarringly obtuse\, the chi
 ldhood friends fashion themes of growth\, loss\, and transformation into o
 ff-kilter pop songs that whirr with the unpredictability of a failing engi
 ne. Thematically\, their songs tackle experiences with gender dysphoria\, 
 transitioning\, anxiety\, and finding a place as a 20-something in a world
  that feels utterly hostile. That search spills over into the music\, too\
 , a playground where each song’s center of gravity seems unpredictable a
 nd fluid. Musically the duo slams against the contours of modern emo & 90s
  college rock\, toying with tropes of country songwriting while threading 
 through elements of electronic music & avant-pop. In less capable hands\, 
 the amalgam could be dizzying. Here\, Rafter & Huntington are in complete 
 control.\nEMPATH\n \nEmpath goes far beyond the sound of birds faintly ch
 irping. They’re a band that writes songs like communing with nature\, br
 inging all their fuzzed and tripped out idiosyncrasies into harmony. Empat
 h began in 2016 when Garrett Koloski\, Emily “Jem” Shanahan\, and C
 atherine Elicson moved into a house in West Philadelphia together. Even 
 with the simple vision to shred\, there’s a natural sensitivity in the w
 ay Empath communicates. Between the contrast of Elicson’s lush\, almost 
 delicate vocals\, Koloski’s boisterous drumming\, and the half-harmoniou
 s wash of guitar and Shanahan’s synths\, Empath equips us with a healthy
  dose of emotional repose.\n \n \n \nANOTHER MICHAEL\n \nFor Another Mich
 ael\, it all boils down to trust. In mid-2017\, the critically acclaimed i
 ndie three-piece packed their bags and collectively relocated from Albany\
 , NY to a shared house in West Philadelphia. This move signaled not only t
 he start of a new chapter for the trio\, but also a deepening of the bonds
  that would come to define their captivating debut LP\, ‘New Music and B
 ig Pop.’\n

 of a shapeshifter when it comes to songwriting\, and Hullabaloo finds him 
 drifting in and out of various eras while still retaining the melodic\, ho
 ok-driven sound his fans have come to expect. From the frantic title track
  to the lush and thoughtful psych rock of “Into The Void\,” you can he
 ar traces of 60s folk\, early Bowie\, grunge and even unabashed pop (“Pr
 otein”). His music has been featured on playlists such as Spotify’s

 eo League is driven by the songwriting of childhood friends Alex Savoth an
 d Dan King. Initially a studio project formed with the help of Engineer an
 d Producer Eric Bogacz\, the three began crafting songs and recruiting a c
 ast of friends to fill in the gaps. Pretty soon\, The League had grown to 
 a dozen members and the result was their debut album “A Light on Each Si
 de”. Often appearing live as a six-piece band\, the group has incorporat
 ed influences from a plethora of genres\, both modern and classic\, refusi
 ng to be boxed in by conventional labels. The outcome is an ever-changing 
 musical landscape that continues to evolve along with their line-up.\nOn t

 he incredible\, indelible Jon Spencer (Blues Explosion\, Boss Hog\, Pussy 
 Galore\, Heavy Trash\, etc) is back with the incendiary HITmakers  - a
 nd with his HOTTEST record yet!  Spencer Gets It Lit is classic Jon Spen
 cer taken to the extremis – electro-boogie\, constructivist art pop\, a 
 psychedelic swamp of industrial sleaze and futurist elegance. It is an epi
 c master work of freak beat from the world’s weirdest garage. Across bra
 in-boggling layers of fury\, fuzz guitar\, and a crashbang battery of phas
 er blasts\, photon torpedoes\, and otherworldly zounds\, he frantically sp
 its\, croons\, rhapsodizes\, and seduces. Spencer Gets It Lit is his most 
 complex and groovy record in years\, a dark\, danceable odyssey – both a
  studied take-down of the early 21st century\, and a celebration of the pl
 ace were electricity meets the mind.\nKILYNN LUNSFORD\n‘Custodians Of Hu
 man Succession’ is Kilynn Lunsford’s first work since the dissolution 
 of her former project\, noise-punk outfit Taiwan Housing Project in 2021. 
 Being now uninhibited by the democratic needs of a band writing and jammin
 g in the practise-room\, choosing to ‘go solo’ liberated her songbuild
 ing process. While some arrangements would be hammered out for weeks\, som
 etimes it was a loose\, “off-the-cuff” take that could make the final 
 cut: “Wanting to combine irreconcilable elements”\, Lunsford explains\
 , “we would set up for hours and then do one take\, always allowing for 
 the aleatoric to come through”.\nLunsford and chief collaborator Don Bru
 no developed a DIY recording style the two jokingly referred to as “Flui
 d Fidelity”: We would record things very flatly”\, explains Lunsford\,
  “ with cheap broken gear and off-time rhythms\, sounds with no reverb o
 r sense of space – almost like an auditory hallucination – and combine
  that with high-end preamps and high-end mics\, so that my voice is out fr
 ont almost to the point of being disembodied from the music.”.\n Kilynn
  performs the music with a full live band.\n

  – Show\nR5 Productions Presents\nMJ LENDERMAN\nJake Lenderman lives in 
 Asheville\, North Carolina. He plays guitar in the indie band Wednesday\, 
 sometimes fishes on the Pigeon River\, and creates his own music as MJ Len
 derman. His latest solo release with Dear Life Records is titled Boat Song
 s. Lenderman describes the album as his most “polished” sound to date\
 , built around songs that “chase fulfillment and happiness”—whether 
 that means buying a boat\, drinking too much\, or watching seeds fall from
  the bird feeder.\n \nBoat Songs is the followup to Lenderman’s 2021 lab
 el debut\, Ghost of Your Guitar Solo\, and subsequent release\, Knockin’
 \, with Dear Life Records\, both of which were critically acclaimed for th
 eir off-the-cuff alternative country sound. But with Boat Songs\, Lenderma
 n emerges confident as ever\, an innovative yet unassuming artist\, straig
 htforward and true.\n \nRecorded at Asheville’s Drop of Sun with Alex Fa
 rrar and Colin Miller\, Boat Songs is the first album Lenderman made in a 
 professional studio. WWE matches and basketball games were silently projec
 ted on the studio walls during recording sessions. And you can hear their 
 power in these ten unapologetically lo-fi tracks\, each brimming with pent
 -up energy and the element of surprise.\n \nA clavichord honks throughout 
 ‘You Have Bought Yourself A Boat’ with the playfulness of a live Dylan
 /Band set. ‘SUV’ screams with My Bloody Valentine distortion. When Xan
 dy Chelmis beautifully bends his steel guitar on ‘TLC Cage Match’ you 
 can’t help but think of Gram Parsons. And ‘Tastes Just Like It Costs
 ’ howls with the intensity of Crazy Horse era Neil Young. Boat Songs is 
 fearless and it’s exciting. It challenges the perception of what modern 
 day country music is supposed to be and where it can go.\n-Ashleigh Bryant
  Phillips\n \nFLORRY\nGram Parsons coined the phrase “Cosmic American Mu
 sic” to describe the synthesis of country\, blues\, rock and soul that h
 e traded in. Sheridan Frances ‘Francie’ Medosch wouldn’t be born for
  another 28 years after Parsons’ 1973 death\, but that Cosmic American s
 ound was waiting for her all the same. On ‘Big Fall’\, she embraces it
  like an old friend.\nSecond Show Added Due To Popular Demand!\nTwo Nights

 8PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nKATH BLOOM\n \nBorn to a musical
  family\, Kath Bloom moved through an early life absorbed and in love with
  the 60s sea change of musical expression\, into a development of her own 
 singular voice that would age to cast a wide net of influence. Her prolifi
 c relationship with Loren Mazzacane Connors in the 80s produced a body of 
 work held sacrosanct by generations of avant-folk luminaries. In 2007 Chap
 ter Music released a tribute album to her songs from that time recorded by
  Bill Callahan\, Meg Baird\, and others\, and her song “Come Here” was
  featured memorably in Richard Linklater’s 1995 film “Before Sunrise
 ”\, in a scene which Ethan Hawke claims was “my favorite scene I ever 
 filmed”. Two lovers listen hanging on the edge of a kiss\, tense and pre
 sent for a moment just out of reach.\n \nAlthough performing this strange 
 and yearning body of work at the time made her nervous and withdrawn\, she
  continued to write and perform quietly all the while. She developed happy
  careers in music therapy for children and horse training\, learning new f
 orms of connection that channeled back into her music and healed her relat
 ionship with performing.\n \nIn recent years she has toured regionally fro
 m her home in Connecticut and has been invited several times to tour inter
 nationally\, honing her current musical partnerships with David Shapiro (g
 uitar\, vocals) and Flow Ness (percussion\, vocals). While she has been en
 couraged to release new music for her new generation of fans\, “Bye Bye 
 These Days” is the first to document her current band’s sound\, which 
 harkens back to the avant leanings of her work with Mazzacane\, but the te
 nsion now is joyful and expert. This is the sound of a practiced life\, le
 arned in all stages of love and loss\, and resolute to keep going\, like a
  locomotive deep into the night.\n \n \n \nSHANNEN MOSER\n \nShannen Mose
 r wants to have a conversation: with their past selves\, their present sel
 f\, their undesignated\, unfurling future selves\; with the trees that ado
 rn their old street\, and the door they used to call home\; with the shado
 ws of lovers-turned-to-friends and the overwhelming cacophony of abrupt ch
 ange. They’re drawing a map but the port of call is cloudy and indistinc
 t. It’s while traveling along these nebulous contours that their latest 
 album The Sun Still Seems To Move forms a kind of physicality\, of outstre
 tched giving hands\, that offers a guide through the fog. Here\, Moser exa
 mines the disorientating\, challenging task of trying to hold onto ourselv
 es––and everything else––all at once. But this isn’t a fatalisti
 c journey of melancholy or apprehension. Instead\, Moser celebrates the sm
 all steps and the unwavering perseverance that makes it all worthwhile.\nA

 T HAS BEEN CANCELLED*\n8PM – Doors9PM – Show\nKIDS RETURN\nKids Return
  is first and foremost a great story of friendship between Adrien Rozé an
 d Clément Savoye. It was in Paris\, at the age of 13\, that the two music
 ians met. Like Japanese director Takeshi Kitano’s film from which it tak
 es its name\, the French duo’s project explores the depth within the fal
 se naivety of childhood\, and the evocative power of nostalgia when it blu
 rs the line between joy and sadness.\n \nKids Return’s sound sits somewh
 ere between the Mamas and the Papas’ Californian pop\, Vladimir Cosma’
 s orchestrations and the modesty of Joe Hisaishi’s soundtracks. It draws
  on Blur’s energy and MGMT’s vocal harmonies\, while revisiting these 
 Anglo-Saxon influences with the precision and delicacy of bands like Air. 
 The result is a romantic and melancholic melody\, a laboratory of emotions
  that can be thought of in pictures.\n \nKids Return is also\, at a time w
 hen music is essentially produced on computer\, the choice of an organic\,
  ample and living sound. With their analogical gears\, which they like to 
 see as children’s toys\, in the manner of François de Roubaix\, Clémen
 t and Adrien compose\, produce and write together. It is between their sma
 ll Parisian studio and a house suspended between the mountains of the Pyre
 nees that their pieces are born\, then orchestrated by a string quartet in
  the countryside. From this journey emerged a dreamlike and sensory music\
 , a call to dream\, an invitation to extract oneself from time.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nKORINE (10:30 PM)Korine is a Phil
 adelphia based electronic pop duo comprised of members Morgy Ramone and Tr
 ey Frye. The pair blends new wave nostalgia with a modern pop sensibility\
 , contrasting upbeat rhythms against sullen\, emotionally evocative lyrics
 . Following a self-released EP “Corsage” in 2017\, Korine debuted thei
 r first full-length record “New Arrangements” in 2018 on Philadelphia 
 label Born Losers Records which helped land the band multiple nationwide t
 ours and two sold out vinyl pressings. Following this release were two acc
 laimed singles “Uncrossed” and “To You” which were specially relea
 sed on a limited 7” vinyl in the Fall of 2019\, and marked a stylistic e
 volution for the band – a departure from the familiar 80s era influence 
 to incorporate a more contemporary pop awareness. Korine’s forthcoming S
 eptember 2020 release “The Night We Raise” shows the band growing even
  further into their own\, both the songwriting and musicality more assured
  than ever\, and will be released jointly by Born Losers Records (US) and

 on On Film is a Modern Rock Outfit from Philadelphia. Their music draws fr
 om a variety of influences including electro-pop\, funk\, chillwave and da
 nce music with an Alternative Rock core and their sound has been compared 
 to A Flock Of Seagulls\, Duran Duran\, and Glass Animals. Formed in 2014 b
 y Jeff Familetti (vocals\, keys\, guitar) and Ryan Bayler (keys\, guitar) 
 as a synth pop duo\, the band recently went through some dramatic changes 
 with the addition of two new members\, Joe Tockett (Drums) and Cameron Kyn
 ett (Bass).  As a result\, the group’s sound has blossomed\, a shift th
 at has garnered local attention and resulted in a feature as one of WXPN
 ’s Local Picks\, as well as a prime spot on the lineup for 2nd Street Fe
 stival. The group is currently in the process of recording their third EP\
 , “Repercussions.”  Their first two EPs\, “Repetitions”  and “
 Reflections\,” were recorded at Headroom Studios by Mark Watter and are 
 currently available for streaming online.  \n \nSTATIC SHAPES (9:00 PM)\n
 Long-time fixtures of the Philadelphia indie rock scene\, singer/guitarist
  Steve Yutzy-Burkey (The Swimmers)\, drummer Mike Kennedy (Audible\, Lefty
 ’s Deceiver)\, bassist Rick Sieber (The Swimmers)\, and keyboard player 
 Alex Yaker (Roomtone) formed Static Shapes in 2019 around a loose collecti
 on of songs that envisioned their Philadelphia riverside neighborhood grad
 ually drifting out to sea. The band dug deep into the limitations of 2020 
 to painstakingly record the sprawling lockdown sounds of the self-produced
  Give Me The Bad News\, which featured on numerous year-end best-of lists\
 , including the San Diego Union-Tribune’s.  Facing another blurring and
  uncertain year\, Kennedy became immersed in William Basinski’s classic 
 The Disintegration Loops as inspiration for a series of glitchy\, 4-track 
 cassette loops that evoked this heavy sense of disruption and loss.  Yutz
 y-Burkey layered melodies over the loops\, drawing from the constant echoe
 s of history encountered in his work restoring pipe organs and renovating 
 Philadelphia’s crumbling buildings.  Merging this backdrop with dreams 
 of an eerily altered future\, the 5-song Blursday EP continues Static Shap
 es’ probing of the limits of home studio production. Dream-pop synths an
 d warbling guitar hooks float over skittering bass and drums\, while shimm
 ers of those original tape loops occasionally rise to the surface.\nSOLD (
 8:00 PM)\n \nFour dudes playing post-punk or indie or whatever you call gu
 itar rock these days. Been there\, done that—in spades. But for those un
 yielding music lovers who like a little chill in their punk or a little go
 th in their indie\, there’s SOLD.  SOLD is a four-piece from Philly. Fo
 r the past 5 years they’ve been crafting a simple and ownable style of r
 ock music that’s centered around heavy rhythms\, spooky synths\, simple 
 guitar\, and melodic vocals.  Their debut LP\, “A New Wind\,” is out 
 now\, recorded at Philadelphia’s renowned Headroom Studios by Kyle Pulle
 y and Mark Watter. \n \n \n

 ing vocals paired with frontman Dara Kiely’s witty\, mundane and often s
 urrealist lyrics create ‘as perfect an expression of rock’n’roll’s
  essential auto-destructive impulse as this writers ever heard.’(The Gua
 rdian). Trailblazers for modern Irish alternative music and known for thei
 r ferocious live shows which have been described as chaotic\, electrifying
  and ‘genuinely dangerous\, like one last rave before the apocalypse’\
 , Gilla Band are not just a band\, but a force. In 2015 they signed to Rou
 gh Trade Records and let loose their debut album Holding Hands With Jamie 
 to rampant critical acclaim\, and topping this was to be no easy feat\, bu
 t following a 4 year hiatus\, they returned in September with their second
  studio album\, The Talkies\, heralded as ‘one of the biggest comebacks 
 of the year ‘ (Mary Anne Hobbs\, 6Music). The Press landscape hailed it 
 as ‘more abstract and more focused than their debut’ with outstanding 
 reviews from the likes of Crack Magazine (9/10)\,The Irish Times (5*) and 
 Record Collector(5/5). The Talkies was Recorded in November 2018 at Ballin
 tubbert House\, Ireland–the alien construction of the house and its corr
 idors help to navigate their cataclysmic sound within a world of its own. 
 And this enigmatic manor became Gilla Band’s sonic playground. It is an 
 album which is living and breathing\, in a continual state of metamorphosi
 s\, and it encompasses everything there is to love about the Dublin 4-piec
 e while simultaneously instilling an exciting level of discomfort. Their t

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nORIONS BELTE\n \nThere are some p
 laces and moments that tie people together forever\, whether it be a place
 \, a song or something you can’t quite define through words. The origins
  of Orions Belte stemmed from one of those mystical moments in time\, whic
 h spawned a lasting creative connection. Øyvind Blomstrøm (guitar) and C
 hris Holm (bass) first met while playing in a touring band for another Nor
 wegian artist. During that time\, they bonded over their love for instrume
 ntal music and began talking about trying their hand at it themselves. Aft
 er their work as touring band ended\, they recruited drummer Kim Åge Furu
 haug\, one of Holm’s longtime friend and collaborators\, to join their n
 ew project.\n \nThe three met in Bergen\, located along the west coast of 
 Norway\, to start working on ideas and demos. Instead\, within just a few 
 days\, they ended up recording their entire first album\, Mint. From the
 re\, the universe propelled them forward\, resulting in a record deal\, th
 eir live debut as a band at Norway’s biggest pop festival Øyafestivalen
  and the release of their debut record all happening within the following 
 year. Mint drew international interest and praise from outlets including
  Atwood Magazine\, who called the record “an eclectic fusion of disparat
 e styles and exciting sounds that says what it wants to say through memora
 ble melodies\, ambient drones\, and a stockpile of wicked guitar riffs.”

 oneers of the Belfast Punk Movement. Signed to the now legendary Good Vibr
 ations label\, their debut release Don’t Ring Me Up received excellent r
 eviews and enjoyed widespread airplay on Radio 1. They quickly came to the
  attention of Rough Trade Records\, who re-released the track to wide accl
 aim. This in turn led to the band signing for Polydor Records\, who releas
 ed the single I Can’t Cope\, followed by I Can Only Dream.\n1979 saw the
  band take to the road with the Boomtown Rats before embarking on two exte
 nsive tours of their own throughout the US and Canada in the early ‘80s.
  An album was recorded with legendary producer Chas Chandler\, who’d wor
 ked with\, among others\, Hendrix\, The Animals and Slade. However\, the b
 and weren’t happy with the result and after a final release\, A Place in
  Your Heart\, the band and label parted ways\, Protex splitting soon after
 .\nFast Forward to 2010\, when New York’s Sing Sing Records located the 
 Polydor recordings and released the album Strange Obsessions on vinyl\, ig
 niting renewed interest in the band.\nFounders Aidan Murtagh and Dave McMa
 ster reformed the band and shows followed across Europe before the band we
 re invited to tour Japan. Protex continued to tour intensively and in 2014
  were invited to play the prestigious South by Southwest festival in Austi
 n\, Texas. They returned the following year and have become regulars at th
 e festival\, often playing there as part of larger US tours. In 2016 Prote
 x concentrated on completing the album Tightrope and signed to Bachelor Re
 cords. Tightrope was released in early 2017\, before the band returned to 
 the USA with a tour that began with a sold-out New York show and finished 
 with a festival appearance in San Antonio.\nWith touring on hold during th
 e pandemic\, the band concentrated on recording a new album Wicked Ways\, 
 released on Bachelor Records in August this year. And with tours already c
 oming together for Europe and the US\, 2023 is already looking like anothe
 r busy year for Protex.\n \n \n

 is Quasi’s tenth record\, landing ten years after their last record\, on
  February tenth. Three tens\, which aligns with the thirty years they’ve
  played together. Sam Coomes and Janet Weiss have become Pacific Northwest
  icons\, and Quasi has always felt so steadfast— their enduring friendsh
 ip so generative\, their energy infinite\, each album more raucous and cat
 chy and ferocious and funny than the last. But we were wrong to ever take 
 Quasi for granted. For a while\, they thought 2013’s intricate Mole City
  might be their last record. They’d go out on a great one and move on. T
 hen in August 2019 a car smashed into Janet’s and broke both legs and he
 r collarbone. Then a deadly virus collided with all of us\, and no one kne
 w when or if live music as we knew it—the touring\, the communal crowds\
 , the sonic church of the dark club—would ever happen again. “There’
 s no investing in the future anymore\,” Janet realized. “The future is
  now. Do it now if you want to do it. Don’t put it off. All those things
  you only realize when it’s almost too late. It could be gone in a secon
 d.”Under lockdown\, Portland’s streets fell still\, airplanes vanished
 \, wildlife emerged. And with the obliterated normal came an unexpected gi
 ft: uninterrupted time\, hours every day\, to make art. Quasi couldn’t g
 o on the road\, so they got an idea: they would act as if they were on tou
 r and play together every single day. Each afternoon\, Sam and Janet bunke
 red down in their tinypractice space and channeled the bewilderment and ab
 surdity of this alien new world into songs. Janet’s strength returned an
 d rose to athlete-level stamina. “When you’re younger and in a band\, 
 you make records because that’s what you do\,” Sam said. “But this t
 ime\, the whole thing felt purposeful in a way that was unique to the circ
 umstances.” They knew they would keep it to just the two of them playing
  together in a room. They knew they’d record the songs live and together
 \, to capture a moment.The incredible result of those sessions is Breaking
  the Balls of History\, recorded in five days and produced by John Goodman
 son at the legendary Robert Lang Studios in Shoreline\, WA. Here are two a
 rtists at their prime\, each a human library of musical knowledge and expe
 rience\, entirely distinctive in their songcraft and sound. In Quasi-form\
 , the band becomes alchemically even greater than the sum of its parts: Ja
 net’s galloping drums and Sam’s punk-symphonic Rocksichord and their i
 ntertwining vocals make something gigantic\, anthemic.\nBAT FANGS\n\n \nBo
 rn of a shared love of hair metal\, partying\, and the reckless spirit of 
 rock and roll\, Washington D.C./ Carborro\, NC duo Bat Fangs brings a fier
 y combination of shredderistic guitars and heavily harmonized hooks.  Gui
 tarist/vocalist Betsy Wright (Ex Hex) and drummer Laura King (Mac McCaugha
 n\, Speed Stick) united after playing a show together in their respective 
 projects\, with the goal of pushing Wright’s pop focused songwriting in 
 a bolder\, brasher direction. Taking up the primary songwriting role and s
 hifting to guitar\, Wright steps outside of the typical Ex Hex sound with 
 Bat Fangs’ rowdy rock.\n

 sist Joe Lally were in a band together\, they were the rhythmic architects
  for Fugazi\, an organization whose decade and a half of disciplined progr
 essivism provided a necessary bridge between the zenith of late-punk expre
 ssion and everything alternative in rock that followed. In 2016\, the two 
 were enlisted by guitarist Anthony Pirog in a conspiracy to subvert and re
 imagine the power trio\, bringing fully into the 21st Century a form that 
 may have reached near perfection with Hendrix’s Band of Gypsys on the ve
 ry first day of the 1970s.\nWith a self-titled recording scheduled for rel
 ease in the Spring of 2018 on Dischord\, the Messthetics will widen the re
 ach of a decisive instrumental music that so far\, they have only shared w
 ith a privileged handful of east coast and southern audiences. Across its 
 eight original compositions and one cover\, Anthony guides the sound throu
 gh complex changes and harmonic densities that might compound\, but never 
 confound or muddy its connection with the listener’s body. Recorded by B
 rendan in their practice space\, the group’s debut gives Anthony ample o
 pportunities to swap guitar textures and styles as freely as an octopus ch
 anges patterns.\n \n— Dr. Thomas Stanley (aka Bushmeat Sound)\nJAMES BRA
 NDON LEWIS TRIO\nI would think James would have a personal reference for s
 uch a title as Eye of I\, the poetic ululation of the trio of words\, not 
 unlike the sound of this particular human trio of music messengers. To my 
 mind\, Eye of I is in reference to a focus\, and a focus which is not enti
 rely disciplinarian but one infused with the spiritual. Having played a ti
 ny bit with James at a loose session some years back\, I felt the sound of
  meditation\, prayer\, and thoughtfulness in both a search and an acceptan
 ce of vibratory creative impulse. We just went into an elemental wave of s
 onics as a free thought recognition of peace and bliss in concordance with
  all the wild conflict this universe has in both its real world and dreams
 cape. The music went outside of any physical construct of time\, space and
  judgment\, feeling perfectly imperfect as a cosmologic unification of ope
 n-hearted love.\nJames’ compositions are at once the sole realizations o
 f his own “living music” concepts\, the aura of actually “seeing” 
 the music as it is conjured and gifted from the composer’s mind\, spirit
 \, and body\, as well as being defined to a profound degree by the interac
 tion of players James finds himself compatriot to. The JBL Trio on Eye Of 
 I is James on tenor\, cellist Christopher Hoffman and percussionist Max Ja
 ffe—augmented on two tracks by the guest appearance of cornetist Kirk Kn
 uffke\, and joined on a third by Anthony Pirog\, Brendan Canty. and Joe La
 lly of The Messthetics—players who have been on the scene\, and who are 
 obviously in the mix for JBL as these serious soul serenaders are not afra
 id to dig in hard to the dynamics being proffered\, always allowing a soph
 istication to present a sentient\, sometimes placid (with youngblood rambu
 nction\, underlying and playful) groove\, a groove dealing with intellect 
 as natural guidance—music reflecting the masters and finding its own com
 munitarian grace.\n— Thurston Moore\, 2022 London\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nKING TUFF\n \nThere are times in 
 our life when we feel magic in the air. When new love arrives\, or we find
 ourselves lost in a moment of creation with others who share our vision. A
  sense that: this iswho I want to be. This is what I want to share.It’s 
 a fleeting feeling and one that Kyle Thomas\, the singer-songwriter who re
 cords andperforms as King Tuff\, found himself longing for in the spring o
 f 2020.But knowing he couldn’t simply recreate this time in his life at 
 will\, Thomas—who hails fromBrattleboro\, Vermont—set out to write a l
 ove letter to those cherished moments of inspirationand to the small town 
 that formed him. The one where he first nurtured his songwritingimpulses\,
  bouncing ideas off other like-minded artists. The kind of place where the
  changing ofthe seasons always delivered a sense of perspective and fresh 
 artistic inspiration. Where he felta deeper connection with nature and sen
 se of community that had once been so close at hand.\n \n“I wanted to ma
 ke an album to remind myselfthat life is magical\,” he reflects.And so\,
  Thomas seized upon his memories\, creating what he calls “an album abou
 t love andnature and youth.”The result isSmalltown Stardust\, a spiritua
 l\, tender and ultimately joyous record that mightcome as a shock to those
  with only a passing knowledge of the artist’s back catalog. OnSmalltown
  Stardust\, Thomas takes us on his journey to a place where past and prese
 nt collide\,where he can be a dreamer in love with all that he sees. Image
 s of his youth abound: fromRoute 91 which runs through his hometown (in 
 “Smalltown Stardust”)\; to Redtooth\, a spectrewho used to roam the st
 reets (“Bandits Of Blue Sky”)\; to old friends\, old haunts and old dr
 eams(“Always Find Me”)\; to Vermont’s Rock River\, which gave its na
 me toa song of a torch stillburning for past love: “Those days are gone 
 and we can’t rewind/ Cuz people grow and placeschange/ But my love for y
 ou will never fade away.\nTCHOTCHKE\nNew York-based trio\, Tchotchke relea
 ses the ‘50s-inspired music video for their single “Wish You Were a Gi
 rl” following the release of their self-titled debut album. The video\, 
 which stars band members Anastasia\, Eva\, and Emily as distraught runaway
 -brides and housewives\, is a statement on rejecting traditional feminine 
 ideologies. “The entire video plays with this fictitious smokey dollhous
 e world where the band runs away from all feminine responsibilities and fo
 rced ideologies\,” director Ambar Navarro shares.  Throughout “Wish Y
 ou Were a Girl\,” we see the trio trapped within the confines of heteron
 ormativity\, and as it progresses\, we see them grow increasingly frustrat
 ed\, leading to their eventual escape from these age-old ideologies. \n

  – Show\nCharlotte Adigéry & Bolis Pupul\nCultural appropriation and ra
 cism. Social media vanity. Post-colonialism and political correctness. The
 se are not talking points that you’d ordinarily hear on the dancefloor b
 ut Charlotte Adigéry and Bolis Pupul are ripping up the rulebook with the
 ir debut album Topical Dancer. The Ghent-based duo\, who broke out with th
 eir 2019 Zandoli EP on Soulwax’s record label DEEWEE\, are rare storytel
 lers in electronic music: they take the temperature of the time and funnel
  them into their playful synth concoctions – never didactic and always w
 ith a knowing wink.\nTheir new studio record – which cements them as a d
 uo under both their names for the first time and is co-written and co-prod
 uced by Soulwax – is both a triumph of kaleidoscopic electro-pop and “
 a snapshot of how we think about pop culture in the 2020s.” It captures 
 Charlotte and Bolis’s essence as musical collaborators and the conversat
 ions they’ve had over the past two years on tour\, as well as their pers
 pectives as Belgians with an immigrant background\, Charlotte with Guadelo
 upean and French-Martinique ancestry and Bolis being of Chinese descent.\n
 Conceptually\, the pair wanted to put these observations and ideas about c
 ulture today and the zeitgeist into a “time capsule shaped like an egg
 ”\, with the idea that you could “bury the album somewhere”\, says B
 olis\, for future generations to find and figure out what the 2020s were a
 ll about through their eyes. The egg is “a visual shorthand\,” they sa
 y\, “for new life and unhatched potential.”\nZandoli was partly an exp
 loration of what it means to be a woman of Caribbean heritage growing up i
 n Belgium – Pitchfork called it “striking\, playful electro pop with a
  sly sense of humour”. Topical Dancer\, however\, expands their worldvie
 w outwards. Songs like “Hey” question the shallowness of ‘wokeness
 ’ and searches for a utopia of “equality\, harmony and integrity”\, 
 while ‘Reappropriate’ is a fluttery R&B-ish song about liberating ones
 elf from sexual trauma. Charlotte sings across English\, Dutch\, Creole an
 d French\, her signature deadpan delivery at times recalling a vogue house
  vocalist or a Black Mirror-style virtual assistant\, giving the album a h
 ypnotic\, fourth-world quality.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nRON GALLO\n \nHi\, my name is Ron
  Gallo\, I live on the line between two mindsets:\n1. The world is complet
 ely fucked2. The universe is inside you\nThis is my artist bio. Who has ti
 me to read this in 2022? With all that’s happening? With these attention
  spans? I know I am not cool or important — no one is — I think it’s
  a good thing. Listen to the music\, come to a show\, think for yourself. 
 The best compliment I ever received was when someone told me they can neve
 r tell when I am serious. My two biggest fears are opposites — having a 
 child or killing someone. You’re probably a little confused or annoyed\,
  but at least you’re not asleep. That’s kind of my thing. I bet you ma
 de it this far. Success!!!\nWe have all been through a lot. Especially the
  last few years but also all the years before that. There was never time t
 o collectively stop and question what has been considered “normal” for
  so long and it turns out nothing really is. These ways of thinking and do
 ing in America were never serving everyone but now they’re not serving a
 nyone (except maybe 5 guys that all look identical and own everything). So
 \, I spent an entire record trying to understand what is happening\, what
 ’s wrong with this place and what’s wrong with myself\, it’s called 
 “FOREGROUND MUSIC” and it’s going to come out on legendary label\, K
 ill Rock Stars\, on 3/3/23.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nFAKE NAMES\n \nIf credibility wer
 e currency\, Fake Names’ wealth would be off the charts. Composed ofBria
 n Baker (Minor Threat\, Bad Religion\, Dag Nasty)\, Michael Hampton (S.O.A
 .\,Embrace)\, Dennis Lyxzén (Refused\, INVSN\, The [International] Noise 
 Conspiracy)\,Johnny Temple (Girls Against Boys\, Soulside) and the newest 
 member Brendan Canty(Fugazi\, Rites of Spring)\, the band is a veritable p
 ost-hardcore dream team. Howeverinstead of rehashing the past\,Expendables
 is a reinvention that sees the band dialingback the distortion and leaning
  into the melodies. The result pairs their unparalleledpedigree with a pop
  sensibility that’s slightly unexpected and wholly satisfying. “On our
 last record [2019’sFake Names] the general influences were 70’s U.K. p
 unk and power-pop\; butit wound up with a little classic rock vibe as well
 \, like the Vibrators meetsAerosmith. We never saw that coming!” Baker e
 xplains. “The pop influences are a littlemore out front on this one and 
 the production really helps it shine. It sounds more direct\,more urgent.
 ”While the band’s debut album was actually a demo that Epitaph founder
  and Baker’s BadReligion bandmate Brett Gurewitz wanted to release as is
 \, forExpendablesthe bandenlisted producer Adam “Atom” Greenspan (IDLE
 S\, Yeah Yeah Yeahs). “On the newrecord the guitar tones are pretty clea
 n\, which is not what we normally do\, but we’re oldenough to know to gi
 ve Atom’s ideas a shot because that’s the whole point of bringingsomeo
 ne in\,” Baker explains. “Atom had me play through amps and pedals way
  out ofmy comfort zone\, but the sounds he built were perfect for the song
 s.” That sense ofcuriosity is a major thematic component ofExpendables\,
 from the chiming harmonies of“Go” to the moody melodicism of “Madtow
 n” (the latter of which could have just as easilybeen written in 1982 as
  it could in 2022). There’s also an economy to these songs that’sroote
 d in the fact that they were recorded in the span of a week\, which elimin
 ated theoption to add superfluous instrumentation or arrangements. The res
 ult is an album thatretains the members’ purity of vision in a strikingl
 y refreshing way.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nWILLIAM ELLIOTT WHITMORE\n \n \nA
  man armed only with a banjo and a bass drum can be a formidable force\, e
 specially if his name is William Elliott Whitmore.  With his powerful vo
 ice and honest approach\, Whitmore comes from the land\, growing up on a 
 family farm in Lee County\, Iowa.  Still living on the same farm today\,
  Whitmore has truly taken the time to discover where his center lies\, and
  from that he will not be moved.\n \nWhitmore has repeatedly carved his ow
 n path\, honoring the longstanding tradition of folk music throughout his 
 nearly 20 year career\, while always allowing his blues\, soul and punk ro
 ck influences to shine through.  Getting his first break opening for his 
 friend’s hardcore band with just a banjo in hand\, he would discover ban
 ds like The Jesus Lizard\, Bad Brains\, Lungfish and Minutemen and soon le
 arn to play his own brand of rural\, roots music with that same DIY ethic.
 \n \nWilliam Elliott Whitmore has been back and forth across the United St
 ates and to cities around the world.  He’s toured with such diverse act
 s as Frank Turner\, Trampled By Turtles\, Clutch and Chris Cornell to name
  a few.  He’s appeared on some of the biggest stages around the world i
 ncluding Stagecoach Fest\, Byron Bluesfest (Australia) and End of the Road
  Fest (UK).  His willingness to take his show to any playing field has pr
 oved invaluable as he turned strangers to diehards with every performance.

 8PM – Doors\n \n9PM – Show\n \n \n \nFUCKED UP\n \nI was sent an unfi
 nished version of Dose Your Dreams so that I might contribute string par
 ts. I couldn’t stop listening to the rough mixes I received. A friend as
 ked me how the record was. I replied\, “My God\, Fucked Up have made the
 ir Screamadelica.”\n \nAnd psych-rock-groove it is. The drums mixed wid
 e\, propensity for drones\, for delay pedal\, for repetition\, groove. The
  politics and aesthetics of hardcore married to an “open format” appro
 ach to genre. Elements of doo-wop\, krautrock\, groove\, digital hardcore.
 \n \n“None of Your Business Man” opens the album in familiar enough te
 rritory\, a sax-assisted exit from an office space. But things get psyched
 elic very quickly. By the time the title track arrives\, Mike Haliechuk is
  whispering\, wah pedals are in full effect\, and we’re wearing oversize
 d t-shirts and pinwheeling. “Accelerate\,” the lyrical centerpiece of 
 the album\, storms in like Boredoms on a bullet train and dissolves into a
  digital nightmare. The album closer\, “Joy Stops Time\,” finds Fucked
  Up at their most Düsseldorfian\, nearly eight minutes of blissful motori
 k.\n \nAt the center of it all is Damian Abraham’s scream—a man chaine
 d\, a man tortured\, a true protagonist. The effect is one of an epic\, ev
 ery chapter attempting its own narrative devices\, its own genre hybridiza
 tion—and it works\, it works so insanely well. The drama unfolds like a 
 miniature world of many parts being explored\, a map being illuminated\, l
 ocation by location.\n \nAs with David Comes to Life\, there is a story h
 ere. David—who once came to life—is now indentured to a desk job. Davi
 d meets the elderly Joyce who closes his eyes\, opens his mind\, and sends
  him on a spiritual journey. David embarks on his own metaphysical odyssey
 . He sees a stage adaptation of his own life. He speaks to an angel in a l
 ightbulb. He sees an infinite series of universes as simulations within si
 mulations.\n \nMeanwhile\, Lloyd—Joyce’s lover—was sent\, decades ag
 o\, by Joyce on the same odyssey\, but was lost in the void. Lloyd seeks t
 o be found and reunited with his lover. Where will David end up? Will Joyc
 e and Lloyd be reunited?\n \nDose Your Dreams—meaning: treat your dreams
  as you would a dream\, allow yourself to be lost within them\, allow them
  to open your heart and your mind\, enjoy them as you would a drug. Reach 
 out for my hand and pull me close.\n \n—Owen Pallett\n \nJune 2018\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nTANUKICHAN\n \nTanukichan is the 
 solo project of classically-trained Bay Area native Hannah van Loon\, whos
 e music screeched to a halt when she discovered what she affectionately ca
 lls “dad rock” in her tween years. Throughout her self described “sh
 eltered” adolescence\, van Loon taught herself guitar by spending hours 
 in front of the radio\, replicating riffs and chords from omnipresent band
 s like The Beatles and Incubus. Although van Loon is the creator and leade
 r of Tanukichan\, the project can be considered a collaboration between he
 r and the Grammy-nominated chillwave pioneer Chaz Bear of Toro y Moi. Afte
 r seeing an early Tanukichan show in 2016\, Bear expressed an interest in 
 working with van Loon\; Radio love\,Tanukichan’s first headbanger of an 
 EP\, arrived on Bear’s own Company Records that same year.The promising 
 four-song project was followed in 2018 by van Loon’s breakout debut LP\,
  Sundays\, which prompted her first solo headlining tour and dates opening
  for artists like Kero Kero Bonito and The Drums. Sundays earned Tanukicha
 n enthusiastic critical acclaim\, with Pitchfork writing that it “captur
 es the spirit of a day whose wide-open nature fosters anxieties as well as
  ambitions” and Rolling Stone lauding its “bruising riffs\, taut groov
 es\, and open-road-ready guitar anthems.” Tanukichan’s sophomore album
  GIZMO is out on March 3rd\, 2023. While still rooted in the eerie shoegaz
 e she’s become known and loved for\, it also sees her go beyond her comf
 ort zone\, incorporating elements of grunge\, industrial synths\, nu metal
  basslines\, and electric guitars that culminate into a captivating wall-o
 f-sound. The result is her most fun-sounding work yet.\nWINTERWhat Kind of
  Blue Are You?\, Winter’s sophomore release with Bar/None Records\, is a
 n emotional excavation of Samira Winter’s purest self.\nMusically\, the 
 LP’s 10 songs reconnect with the earliest incarnation of Winter\, once a
 gain painting with brushstrokes of distorted guitar\, but using them to fu
 el a wiser\, more mature form of sonic liberation. Whereas 2020’s Endle
 ss Space (Between You and I) was steeped in fairytale surrealism and spri
 nglike grace\, her latest offering is crystalline and spartan\, songs stri
 pped to their inner blue core\, Winter’s smoldering shadow self.\nIt’s
  another stunning work in a canon that’s established her as one of Los A
 ngeles’ most enduring\, consistently-head-turning dream poppers\, the me
 lancholy and bittersweet beauty that’s been with her throughout Winter
 ’s existence now pushed to center stage. Strengthened by her ever-increa
 sing powers as a songwriter\, she confronts painful wounds of trauma and d
 espair for the first time on record\, and achieves some semblance of peace
  and healing in the process.\n

 PM – Doors\n \n8PM – Show\n \n \n \nWESTERMAN\n \nUK artist Westerman
  returns with his first offering in two years with the song “Idol\; RE-r
 un” out via Partisan Records. The new track\,produced by James Krivcheni
 a and Westerman\,juxtaposes gentle and celestial sonics with an aggrieved 
 disposition and features artwork by renownedNew York via Portugal Graphic 
 Designer and Illustrator Bráulio Amado. The song was written after Wester
 man emergedfrom a period of disenchantment with making music\, and with th
 e future of his career feeling abstract\, it seemed unclear to Westerman w
 hether the material he was recording would ever be heard. Creatively\, thi
 s offered a strange kind of freedom\, and accommodated some of the most ad
 venturous and unselfconscious songwriting of his career. Finding textures 
 became a central concern taking programming and looping into his own hands
  in a way he never had before\, creating polyrhythmic grooves to lend urge
 ncy to his inner dialogue.”Idol\; RE-run” is the first taste of songs 
 written in this period and provides a hint for what’s to come from Weste
 rman in the coming year. The track featuresJames Krivchenia\, Mikel Patric
 k Avery and Booker Stardrum on drums\, Ben Reed on bass\, Luke Temple on s
 ynth\, Mat Davidson on piano\, Robin Eubanks on the trombone and of course
  Westerman on vocals\, guitar and synth.Speaking about the new song\, West
 erman shares:”The lyrics to the song were written around the same time a
 s the storming of the Capitol. The compulsion towards the pedestal is stro
 ng. The need to scapegoat and revere without logic. Our populists actively
  celebrate their being people who don’t know anything other or better th
 an anyone else\, yet these spectres with their failings conduct our anger 
 and resentment as if they were gods. They are nothing more than the shadow
  of something else\, the face fronting a need to be loved or revered prese
 nt in everyone. And there will always be another face to front.”\n
