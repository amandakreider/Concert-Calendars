 1968 by Jon Anderson and the late\, and much-missed\, Chris Squire\, YES h
 ave been one of the most innovative\, influential and best-loved bands in 
 rock music history. Their 1970s albums The Yes Album\, Fragile\, Close To 
 The Edge\, Yessongs (a triple live album set)\, Tales From Topographic Oce
 ans\, Relayer and Going For The One were ground-breaking in musical style 
 and content. Their music also became synonymous with artist Roger Dean who
 se distinctive YES logo design and artwork adorned the lavish gatefold pre
 sentation sleeves of many YES albums.\nWith sales of over 50 million recor
 ds\, the Grammy-award winning YES were inducted into The Rock And Roll Hal
 l Of Fame in 2017 where they performed Roundabout from the album Fragile a
 nd the FM radio-friendly Owner Of A Lonely Heart from the 1985 album 90125
 .\nYES released their 22nd studio album in 2021\, The Quest\, produced by 
 Steve Howe and which went to No. 1 in the UK Rock Albums Chart and entered
  the Official UK Album Chart at No. 20. In 2022 came the sad news that dru
 mmer Alan White\, ever-present in the YES line-up for 50 years\, had passe
 d away. The news came shortly before the band embarked on their classic\, 
 genre-defining album Close To The Edge 50th Anniversary Tour which they de
 dicated to Alan.\nIn February 2023\, ahead of the news of the new studio a
 lbum Mirror To The Sky\, YES confirmed Jay Schellen as the new permanent d
 rummer with YES\,hand-picked to step into his mentor and friend Alan White
 ’s role. “I had done the 2016 tour on my own for Alan\,” says Jay. 
 “From late 2017 onwards\, we had a beautiful partnership. I learned and 
 discovered so much about Alan’s style.His passion and creativity was phe
 nomenal. The new album has Alan’s presence all over it. It is inside of 
 us. So\, this is still\, in my heart\, Alan just being present and with us
 \, and with me\, in a big way.”\n

 \nIt took Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats less than five years to be
 come one of the most recognizable new forces in contemporary rock ’n’ 
 roll. Since 2015\, Rateliff has led his denim-clad\, horn-flanked Night Sw
 eats\, supplying the zeal of a whiskey-chugging Pentecostal preacher to so
 ngs about this world’s shared woes. They’ve had hits\, sure\, but thei
 r combustible mix of soul and rock quickly cemented them as the rare gener
 ational band who balanced ecstatic live shows with engrossing and rich rec
 ords. To wit\, is there any other modern act capable of revving up stadium
  crowds for The Rolling Stones while also appearing on Saturday Night Live
  and CMT Crossroads and at NPR’s Tiny Desk in short order? When Rateliff
  returned from his pandemic-truncated solo tour in March 2020\, he struggl
 ed with the same question that vexed so many of us then—what now? Fortun
 ately\, he returned to his Colorado homestead and penned a set of songs th
 at synthesized his introspection with his anthemic inclinations. The resul
 t is The Future\, the third Night Sweats album but the first to capture th
 is octet’s true depth and breadth. An instant classic of 11 songs\, the 
 album presents something more sustainable\, interesting\, and indeed open
 —a songwriter and band growing into bigger questions and sounds\, into a
  future that allows them to remain recognizable but be so much more compel
 ling than some denim-clad caricature.\n

 _______________________________________________\nIt could only be called a
 lchemy\, the transformative magic that happens during the Yeah Yeah Yeahs
 ’ most tuned-in moments in the studio\, when their unique chemistry spar
 ks open a portal\, and out comes a song like “Maps” or “Zero” or t
 he latest addition to their canon\, “Spitting Off the Edge of the World
 ” — an epic shot-to-the-heart of pure YYYs beauty and power. “It’s
  really awe-inspiring to watch the process of Karen’s melodies and lyric
 s just coming to her\, right there\,” says guitarist Nick Zinner. “Lik
 e\, ‘what the fuck\, where did that come from?’ When it strikes her\, 
 it’s the most incredible thing.”\n“The look on Nick’s face when th
 at happens\,” Karen O says\, with a laugh\, “it’s primo\, man. I kno
 w I’m onto something because I can tell it’s hitting him somewhere in 
 his soul. We’ve been doing this together so long\, and there are moments
  when the song comes from God-knows-where\, and it feels like there’s a 
 change in the air quality\, in the atmosphere\, like when it’s about to 
 thunderstorm.”\nA thunderstorm of a return is what the legendary trio ha
 s in store for us on Cool It Down\, their fifth studio album and their fir
 st since 2013’s Mosquito. The eight-track collection\, bound to be a lan
 dmark in their catalog\, is an expert distillation of their best gifts tha
 t impels you to move\, and cry\, and listen closely.\nThey never expected 
 it to be so long between albums\, and they certainly had stayed busy: Ther
 e was a tour for their 2003 debut album\, Fever to Tell that was re-issued
  in 2017\; Karen released an album with Danger Mouse (Lux Prima\, 2019) an
 d co-composed the score for the animated film Where Is Anne Frank?\; Nick 
 made an album with his hardcore side-project Head Wound City\, scored film
 s\, and collaborated with artists including Phoebe Bridgers\, Amen Dunes a
 nd Songhoy Blues\; drummer Brian Chase started his own label Chaiken Recor
 ds. Karen and Brian both became parents in recent years.\nThe band had eve
 n begun talking about new music back in early 2020\, but then the world st
 opped. “I was having dreams\, as I’m sure many people were during the 
 early part of the pandemic and lockdown\, of places I’d been\,” Karen 
 says. “Dreams of cities we’ve toured in the last twenty years together
 \, whether it’s Byron Bay or Paris morphed with Mexico — my brain was 
 taking me to all these places. And I felt\, for the first time\, ‘what i
 f we don’t get to do it again?’ That thought had never crossed my mind
  before and I really felt it profoundly during the pandemic: I realized I
 ’d taken for granted that we’ll always be able to go out on the road a
 nd play shows\, that we’ll always be able to make more music when we wan
 t to. And having gone through the collective trauma of what we experienced
 \, I really wanted to get in a room together and jam\, and see what our su
 bconscious was going to unleash after all that time.”\nShe and Nick got 
 together in spring of 2021 to give it a try. “We started playing music a
 nd it just came flooding out of us\,” Karen remembers. They began in Apr
 il and were basically done by August – “the quickest a record has ever
  come to us.”\n“Flooding is a very apt word\,” says Nick. “I think
  all of us needed this release. For me\, in 2020\, I could not do anything
 . I tried working every day\, and nothing came. It was completely frozen. 
 I spent the month of March 2021 trying to get back into creating and makin
 g what I thought could be little starter ideas\, just to define some of th
 e elements.” They made demos at Nick’s place in Los Angeles and carved
  out time with producers they knew would elevate the tracks\, including Ju
 stin Raisen\, Andrew Wyatt and longtime collaborator Dave Sitek. who has c
 ontributed to every Yeah Yeah Yeahs album since Fever To Tell and whom the
  band consider “basically a fourth member of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs\, at th
 is point.”\nEarly on\, Sitek shared a folder of song-beginnings that inc
 luded the framework for “Spitting Off the Edge of the World\,” and Kar
 en connected with it right away. “When I heard the opening line\, it fel
 t like a waterfall\,” she says. “[David] Bowie came to mind immediatel
 y. Sitek was actually friends with Bowie\, and it felt like he was tuning 
 into that frequency of artistry. And so when I was writing the lyrics and 
 the melody\, that’s who I was trying to tune into\, as well. Because I
 ’ve never tried to evoke Bowie before. But he’s gone now\, and there
 ’s a big\, gaping hole.” And when she imagined another voice joining h
 ers on the tune\, the idea to invite Perfume Genius’s Mike Hadreas felt 
 obvious. “Mike really has a bit of Bowie in him\,” she says. “He was
  literally the first and only person that came to mind for it.”\nKaren e
 xplains that the lyrics for “Spitting…” (as well as other songs on C
 ool It Down) reflect on the state of the environment\, and the need for ho
 nesty about the damage we’re doing to the Earth. “We’re all experien
 cing this climate crisis through a system which is broken and not really a
 ddressing it\,” she says. On “Spitting…\,” she reframes the topic 
 as a personal conversation with her son about the world he’s inheriting.
  “I see the younger generations staring down this threat\, and they’re
  standing on the edge of a precipice\, confronting what’s coming with an
 ger and defiance\,” she says. “It’s galvanizing\, and there’s hope
  there.”\nNick had sent Karen the initial idea for “Burning\,” and w
 hen they got into the studio\, he says\, “she had zoomed in on this one 
 15-second part and was like\, ‘what if we speed this up?’ That became 
 the piano loop in the song\, but it was just the beginning.” As they con
 tinued working in Nick’s basement studio\, they had another of those oth
 erworldly moments when the words and melody thunderstormed in. “The firs
 t verse just came\,” says Nick. “I watched it enter her\, like she was
  downloading it from somewhere. I get shivers just thinking about it. It w
 as absolutely incredible and the first part of that song came together in 
 like half an hour.”\n“I didn’t want to hit the nail directly on the 
 head\, but it feels like at this point\, we should just be screaming certa
 in things\,” says Karen. “In LA\, 2020 was one of the worst years for 
 wildfires. And that hook — ‘into the sea\, out of the fire’ — just
  came right through me.” Melodically\, she says they were inspired enoug
 h by the Four Seasons’ classic “Beggin’” that its writers are cred
 ited on the track. “Nick and I have loved that song forever\, and played
  it at every house party DJ set we’ve ever done together\,” Karen says
 \, “so it’s in our bones\, to a certain degree.”\nAnd that’s not t
 he only track where they embraced the opportunity to honor their influence
 s. The Justin Raisen-produced “Fleez” references the pioneering New Yo
 rk City art-funk band ESG\, whose early 80s singles are among the most fre
 quently sampled tracks in modern music history\, period. “Fleez” incor
 porates elements from the 1981 ESG song “Moody (Spaced Out)”\, and inc
 ludes writing credit for the band’s Renee Scroggins. Karen says ESG have
  been a massive inspiration to her\, ever since discovering their music vi
 a the 2000 compilation A South Bronx Story. “Hearing that changed my lif
 e when I was 22\,” Karen says. “The style and attitude and power and s
 exuality — all of it. So we didn’t shy away from leaning into that. Ju
 st like with ‘Burning”\, at this point in our career\, we want to pay 
 homage to the music that left a deep impression on us.”\nWhereas anthemi
 c\, dancefloor-bound tracks like “Burning” and “Wolf” and “Spitt
 ing Off the Edge of the World” could be seen as big\, bold rallying crie
 s to a new collective consciousness\, there are also songs like “Blackto
 p” and “Mars” whose delivery is so intimate\, it’s as though Karen
  O is whispering them to you alone. “After a time of being apart so much
 \, I wanted a kind of radical closeness\, like feeling someone’s breath 
 on my face\,” she says. “Mars” is also one of a few instances where 
 Karen’s vocals are spoken rather than sung\, which she’d never before 
 attempted. “I did an interview with Michelle Zauner from Japanese Breakf
 ast and she asked\, ‘Have you ever thought about writing poetry?’ It w
 as like\, ‘Yeah\, I’ve thought about it this whole time.’ So I start
 ed writing\, and ‘Mars’ was probably the first poem I had written sinc
 e high school. It was scary at first to read it as a poem\, but it really 
 resonated with the soul of the record. And it’s an amazing thing to feel
  vulnerable this late in your career\, and to try things that make you fee
 l totally like a beginner again.”\nThough the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were only 
 able to be physically together in the studio for four glorious days at Son
 ic Ranch in Tornillo\, Texas\, that just highlighted the preciousness of t
 ime\, and reaffirmed their resolve not to take anything for granted. “Mu
 sic has been a lifeline for me and Nick and Brian over the last 21 years\,
  as it is for so many people.” says Karen O. “It’s a safe haven for 
 big emotions. For a lot of the songs on this record\, we’re giving voice
  to the feelings I want to hear reflected back to me in music. It’s conf
 rontational\, and it’s emotional\, and it’s addressing things that nob
 ody wants to look at. As an artist\, there’s a responsibility to do that
 . I know when I feel that reflected back to me\, I’m so grateful\, becau
 se it makes me feel less crazy and less alone in the world. That’s where
  music reigns. This record was a chance for us to use that superpower. Thi
 s record feels like it has a different kind of urgency.”\n

 _______________________\n\nMyke Towers worships a good rhyme. Over the pas
 t decade\, the acclaimed rapper and singer hasgrown into one of Puerto Ric
 o’s top lyricists\, melding streetwise storytelling and massive pophooks
  into a career filled with chart–topping anthems. Towers is one of the O
 Gs of Latin trap\,breaking out in 2013 alongside rookie visionaries such a
 s Álvaro Díaz and Fuete Billete\, whochanneled the irreverence and visce
 ral songwriting of classic reggaetón with fresh flows echoingAtlanta trap
 . Hits like “La Curiosidad” and “Bandido” cemented Towers as one o
 f the all–stars ofmúsica urbana\, even earning him the nickname of Youn
 g King. Yet despite multiple LatinGrammy nominations and blockbuster cross
 overs with some of the industry’s biggest names\,Myke Towers still feels
  like his story is just beginning.\n“I’m a regular kid from Puerto Ric
 o who always dreamed of making music\,” says Towers\, whowas born in 199
 4 by the name of Michael Torres. Hailing from the neighborhood of Caimito\
 , inSan Juan\, the young Towers was raised in a family where music was a s
 afe and nourishingconstant. “We always listened to salsa\, boleros\, and
  Puerto Rican folk music\, so I’ve held a deeprespect for music all my l
 ife. If I wasn’t a singer I don’t know what I would be doing.”\nAt 1
 8 years old\, Myke Towers began uploading his first freestyles and experim
 ents toSoundCloud\, where word quickly spread about the new Boricua rap ta
 lent to watch. He releasedhis first mixtape El Final del Principio in 2016
 \; an impressively mature record ofautobiographical lyrics and boom–bap 
 beats that invoked classic rap. Three years later\, his effortsled him to 
 collaborate with Farruko on the hit single “Si Se Da\,” reuniting the 
 following year forthe viral remix of “La Playa\,” which also featured 
 a verse from Maluma. These songs were aturning point in Towers’ career\,
  as he reached broader audiences and embraced a morecommercial sound that 
 launched him into the stratosphere.\n“Those songs made people look at me
  not only as a rapper but as an artist\,” he remembers.“[Working with 
 Farruko] was like receiving an invitation to a really important party\, an
 d ofcourse I accepted.”\nIn 2020 Towers released Easy Money Baby\, an LP
  that expanded his sonic palette even furtherwith blasts of reggaetón\, d
 ancehall\, and baile funk on hits like “Diosa” and “Girl.” That sa
 meyear\, collaborations with Bad Bunny\, Nicky Jam\, Camila Cabello\, Beck
 y G and Anitta cementedhim as one of the leading names in mainstream regga
 etón\, though his heart yearned for a returnto his rap roots. Lyke Mike a
 rrived in 2021\, loaded with introspective bars and throbbing trap anddril
 l beats. Cuts like “Mírenme Ahora” and “Pin Pin” showcased Towers
  at the top of hissongwriting game\, remaining true to his artistic vision
  and complex narratives without relying oncatchy pop choruses.“Collabora
 tions are important to help you grow\, but I also need to make personal mu
 sic tounburden myself. The type of music you don’t care if it’s a hit 
 or not\,” he says. “[Lyke Mike] is aguide for rappers on the come–up
 \, or anyone out there chasing a dream. That type of music is a part of me
  and when I go too long without releasing anything in that style\, even my
  fans start\n\n\nasking for it.”\nHaving satisfied his MC’s calling\, 
 Myke Towers returns to euphoric pop on his upcoming album.The first single
 \, “Ande Con Quien Ande” with Jhay Cortez is a hard–grinding reggaet
 ón bangerdesigned for dance floor throwdowns. The new record also sources
  fresh global sounds includingAfrobeats and electropop\, perfected in the 
 studio with the help of elite producers such as Tainyand Russivn.\n“This
  is the kind of album you play from start to finish and don’t skip a sin
 gle song\,” saysTowers excitedly. “I’m in the studio every single da
 y and I like to challenge myself and play withnew rhythms. I’m at my pea
 k and working with people bringing new colors and flavors to thetable. The
  record is inspired by those times we feel like we’re wasting our time c
 hasing what wewant. But you get one life and we have to enjoy every second
  of it.\n\n

 n NYC–born 21–year–old – became an internet heartthrob with stream
 s in the multi–millions\, he was just a kid from the Bronx. A closer lis
 ten offers the biography of a kid who survived adult sins and consequences
  before he was old enough to drive. Raised in an NYC neighborhood saturate
 d with gang culture and deficient of positivity\, Lil Tjay eventually earn
 ed himself a year of incarceration. Upon release\, he committed himself to
  finding legal routes toward his music dreams. The studio would be his sav
 ing grace and destiny. His first recording birthed the heartless yet catch
 y “Resume.” Soon after\, the flammable “Brothers” would earn him h
 is first Internet smash. He’s since had collaborations with a handful of
  prominent musicians such as YG\, Pop Smoke\, Tory Lanez & 6LACK. In fact\
 , Lil Tjay released his ground–breaking single “Calling My Phone” wh
 ich topped multiple streaming charts with 6Lack. He then followed up the v
 iral track with his highly anticipated sophomore album Destined 2 Win in A
