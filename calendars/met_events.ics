 ) has garnered a loyal following from his widely popular digital sketches 
 and hilarious standup\, generating an extraordinary amount of buzz among h
 is peers within the entertainment industry as one of comedy’s most notab
 le rising stars.\n \nSince his first Facebook post in October 2014 went v
 iral\, the charismatic comic has amassed millions of followers across Face
 book and Instagram\, where fans tune in daily to his viral sketches featur
 ing original characters such as Drip and Buddy\, with cameos from notable 
 celebrities including Ludacris\, Mike Epps\, Charlamagne tha God and Lamar
  Odom\, to name a few.\n\nKeeping it real\, mining comic gold from the eve
 ryday and applying his genius for freestyling\, Wayne is a master comic s
 toryteller. In 2017 Wayne embarked on the 150-date national “Child Suppo
 rt Tour\,” selling out clubs and theaters across America. That wasn’t 
 just a clever moniker – he’s the dad of ten kids and even as he build
 s his own entertainment legacy\, he’s all about securing the future for 
 them. \n\n“My hashtag\, my mantra\, is ‘Help is On The Way!’ – th
 at’s my slogan\, I own it\, because I believe God’s got my back and yo
 ur back and whatever is stressing you out today\, it won’t last because 
 help is truly on the way\,” says Wayne\, whose endearingly funny way wit
 h English comes from growing up “Kountry” in Millen\, GA (pop. 3500)\,
  between Statesboro and Augusta. He was given what became his stage name d
 uring a stint living and going to school in Savannah in the mid-2000s. \n
 \nIn January 2020\, Wayne began his “The People’s Champ” North Ameri
 can tour\, travelling to cities across the U.S. and Canada including Miami
 \, Pittsburgh\, West Palm Beach\, Phoenix and more. In the spring of 2021\
 , Wayne performed in arenas alongside comedy heavyweight\, Mike Epps\, on 
 the “In Real Life Comedy Tour\,” ranked #1 on Pollstar’s Top Global 
 Concert Tour list. Wayne was featured on MTV’s “Wild ‘N Out” with 
 Nick Cannon\, starred in the BET original Christmas rom-com film\, “Holi
 day Heartbreak\,” and debut at #10 of The Hollywood Reporter’s Top Com
 edians List\, which includes Ricky Gervais\, D.L Hughley\, and Kevin Hart.
  Most recently\, Wayne wrapped his “Straight Out The Mud” tour present
 ed by Live Nation. \n\nWayne\, along with Kym Whitley\, currently co-hosts
  “I Love Us\,” a new comedy clip show on BET+. Additionally\, Wayne is
  set to release his first book “Help Is On The Way” in April 2023 – 
 a memoir covering everything from his childhood\, past struggles and path 
 to success. Up next\, he will be starring alongside Chloe Bailey\, Quavo\,
  Mack Wilds\, Druski\, and more\, in Universal Pictures’ “Praise This\
 ,” produced by Will Packer and directed by Tina Gordon.\n\nWith his humb
 le roots and unbridled energy\, Wayne continues to build his audience with
  cutting edge yet clean\, curse free material whose appeal transcends all 
 cultural lines and is fit for (and often draws) the whole family. All whil
