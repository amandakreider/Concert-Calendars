 ors at 6:00 pm\nShow starts at 7:00 pm\n\n\nSupport: Walk off the Earth\nD
 oors at 6:00p.m.\nFew artists embody boundless creativity quite like Linds
 ey Stirling. Not only a multi-award-= winning musician known for her genre
 -bending virtuosity on electronic violin\, she’s endlessly dazzled audie
 nces with her extraordinary talents as a dancer—an element she brings to
  the stage as part of her spectacular live show\, touring with a stunning 
 frequency and continually selling out iconic venues all around the world. 
 Also a New York Times bestselling author (and creator of her own comic boo
 k)\, the platinum-selling star felt compelled to push her boundaries even 
 further for her seventh full-length effort\, ultimately embracing a whole 
 new level of freedom in her songwriting. A visionary meditation on inner w
 isdom\, personal strength\, and the ever-shifting nature of identity\, Dua
 lity arrives as Stirling’s most sonically daring and emotionally complex
  album date.\nMade with producers/co-writers like Graham Muron (Thirty Sec
 onds to Mars\, Skrillex) and Lucky West (Walk the Moon\, Dreamers)\, Duali
 ty encompasses a dozen songs showcasing Stirling’s refined musicality an
 d gift for sculpting deeply expressive melodies. But while the album’s f
 irst half centers on a grandiose and elaborately composed sound informed b
 y Celtic music and other global influences\, its latter half leans toward 
 a boldly original form of left-of center pop. To that end\, side A include
 s such tracks as “Eye Of The Untold Her\,” a gloriously epic piece pro
 duced by Mako (a musician/songwriter/producer whose credits include co pro
 ducing top-selling releases from video-game giant Riot Games) and co-writt
 en with Steve Mazzaro (a composer who’s worked with the legendary Hans Z
 immer to arrange and produce the music for the Oscar winner’s world tour
 s). Meanwhile\, side B spotlights Stirling’s pop sensibilities on songs 
 like the luminous “Inner Gold” (featuring alt-pop artist Royal & the S
 erpent) and “Survive” (on which Walk off the Earth vocalist Sarah Blac
 kwood joins in for an interpolation of Gloria Gaynor’s disco classic “
 I Will Survive”).\nA profoundly imaginative songwriter whose past work i
 ncludes such high-concept albums as 2019’s Artemis—a No. 1 on Billboar
 d’s Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart—Stirling makes brilliant use of 
 Duality’s extravagant soundscape by exploring intricate questions of int
 uition and truth. “I’ve always felt that we’re all magical beings wi
 th so much spirit and potential\, but we live in a world of expectations a
 nd rules that often makes us feel so constrained\,” Stirling says. “I 
 hope that in some way these songs help people to feel free and empowered a
 nd more connected to their truest selves. I’d love to remind everyone th
 at even though the world tries to tame us\, that magic is always there wit
 hin you.”\n

 \nShow starts at 8:00 pm\n\n\nWhat eventually became Buzz\, the third stud
 io album by singer-songwriter and globally- renowned star NIKI\, started w
 ith an urgent quake from the innermost core of her being. What surfaced in
  its wake was a collection of warm\, stirring folk-rock songs\, which crac
 kle and flare like a bonfire between close confidantes. “I went through 
 an identity crisis\,” says the 25-year-old of Buzz. “It took a lot of 
 trial and error\, and I just stumbled upon pieces of myself along the way.
  I named it Buzz because it feels like I’m on the precipice of something
  about to happen.” For NIKI\, things have been happening progressively s
 ince she was a high schooler in Jakarta\, Indonesia. As a student at an in
 ternational academy\, she cut her teeth scribbling lovesick poems in Engli
 sh class and performed acoustic guitar covers of American pop songs on You
 Tube. With a six-string in hand\, and her family and classmates cheering h
 er on from the audience\, Nicole Zefanya then staked her claim to global s
 tardom as NIKI. And claim it she has – with over three billion streams w
 orldwide\, sold out shows on multiple continents\, massive sets at festiva
 ls across the globe\, front row seats at Paris Fashion Week\, four songs o
 n a Marvel film’s soundtrack\, and some of the most phenomenal\, confess
 ional songs being released in 2024\, NIKI has already established a vetera
 n’s resume before the age of 25.\nOn Buzz\, her songwriting remains as i
 ntimate as ever. In her initial sketches of songs for Buzz\, NIKI took cue
 s from other lane-paving women with confessional\, honest lyricism soundtr
 acked by guitars. “Joni Mitchell is my songwriting north star\,” she s
 ays — and uncompromising feminist luminaries like Stevie Nicks\, Carly S
 imon and Liz Phair. To match the wandering spirit of Buzz\, NIKI cultivate
 d her own elastic approach to guitar. To further harness this creative and
  personal sea change\, NIKI began enlisting producers who had worked with 
 her favorite contemporary singer-songwriters. She tapped Tyler Chester\, w
 ho’d captured tracks with Madison Cunningham and Sara Bareilles\; she al
 so recruited Ethan Gruska\, who counts Fiona Apple and Phoebe Bridgers as 
 collaborators. Buzz reverberates with the hard-earned wisdom of a young wo
 man who charges dauntlessly towards her dreams — but can still spare a l
 augh if she stumbles.\n

 ________________________________________\nAs NPR writes\, “siblings Clyd
 e and Gracie Lawrence are not your typical pair.” Clyde Lawrence and Gra
 cie Lawrence have been writing songs and listening to countless Stevie Won
 der\, Randy Newman\, and Aretha Franklin records in their family’s New Y
 ork City apartment since they were little kids. After years of playing tog
 ether\, they officially created Lawrence\, an eight-piece soul-pop band co
 mprised of musician friends from childhood and college. The band has since
  gained a devoted following for its high-energy\, keyboard-driven sound\, 
 which features tight\, energetic horns and explosive lead vocals.\nIn July
  2021\, Lawrence released their new album\, Hotel TV\, and became the firs
 t band to release music under Beautiful Mind Records\, the label of Grammy
 -winning producer/songwriter/artist Jon Bellion\, who co-produced and co-w
 rote the songs on the album. The tracks on Hotel TV have garnered tens of 
 millions of streams across all platforms and have had multiple viral momen
 ts on Tik Tok and Instagram. The album’s lead single\, “Don’t Lose S
 ight\,” was featured in an international Microsoft commercial\, which pr
 opelled it into the Top 20 on the USA Shazam Pop Charts\, and also hit #33
  on Top 40. The band performed “Don’t Lose Sight” on Jimmy Kimmel Li
 ve\, did a performance of it for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\, and 
 closed both of their sets at Coachella with it (with the entire audience s
 inging along)! The band is working on a new album\, and their most recent 
 single\, “23” came out in November 2023. They played “23” and othe
 r new music live during their set at Jingle Ball in 2023.\nTouring has bee
 n a key component of the group’s rise to success\; In 2023\, the band jo
 ined Jonas Brothers on their four month\, sixty-five show tour across Nort
 h America. The release of Hotel TV was also supported by the Hotel TV Tour
 \, a 53-city tour across major cities in North America\, including sold ou
 t shows at Terminal 5 in New York City\, House of Blues in Chicago\, and t
 wo nights at the Royale in Boston\, among others. The band is releasing a 
 docuseries from their adventures on the road of their Hotel TV Tour\, airi
 ng throughout the summer and fall of 2023 on YouTube. The band followed th
 eir Hotel TV Tour with a co-headline tour with MisterWives\, and then ende
 d 2022 with their first ever Lawrence festival entitled “Staycation\,”
  which featured three nights of sold out headlines shows at Brooklyn Steel
 \, which they curated with numerous special guests and non-repeating sets.
  Lawrence also completed a headline tour across Europe in March with sold 
 out shows in London\, Paris and Amsterdam. In addition to directly support
 ing the Jonas Brothers on their 2023 North America tour\, they’ve also t
 oured with acts such as Lake Street Dive\, Vulfpeck\, Jon Bellion\, Jacob 
 Collier\, Soulive\, O.A.R.\, and Bernhoft\, and has appeared at major fest
 ivals including Coachella\, Bonnaroo\, Outside Lands\, Firefly\, Okeechobe
 e\, Hangout\, and Summerfest. They have performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live\, T
 he Late Show with Stephen Colbert\, The Today Show & NBC’s Last Call wit
 h Carson Daly.\nIn addition to creating music\, in December 2022\, Clyde L
 awrence (lead vocals\, keyboards) wrote an article published by the New Yo
 rk Times regarding the unfair dynamics that artists face in the live music
  industry as a result of the merging of Ticketmaster and Live Nation. In J
 anuary 2023\, Clyde Lawrence and Jordan Cohen (saxophone\, tour manager) w
 ere invited to testify at a U.S. Senate Judiciary hearing in Washington\, 
 D.C.\, on the topic of live event ticketing. They sat alongside other indu
 stry professionals\, as well as antitrust experts\, to deliver a testimony
  about their experiences as a touring band playing in Live Nation-owned ve
 nues across the U.S. Lawrence and Cohen continue to spread the word about 
 the challenges in the live event promotion and ticketing space in conversa
 tions with outlets like NBC News\, Vice News\, Politico\, and more. In 202
 4\, the band will enter a new era – Family Business. In January\, Lawren
 ce announces their upcoming fourth studio album\, Family Business\, releas
 ing mid 2024\, along with their biggest headline tour yet across Europe (S
 ummer 2024) and North America (Fall 2024).\n

 .\nBrittany Howard:\nThere’s a double meaning to the title of What Now\,
  the revelatory new album from singer/songwriter Brittany Howard. “With 
 the world we’re living in now\, it feels like we’re all just trying to
  hang onto our souls\,” says the Nashville-based musician and frontwoman
  for four-time Grammy Award-winning Alabama Shakes. “Everything seems to
  be getting more extreme and everyone keeps wondering\, ‘What now? What
 ’s next?’ By the same coin\, the only constant on this record is you n
 ever know what’s going to happen next: every song is its own aquarium\, 
 its own little miniature world built around whatever I was feeling and thi
 nking at the time.”\nWith five Grammy® wins and sixteen nominations\, H
 oward follows up her massively acclaimed solo debut Jaime—a 2019 LP that
  landed on best-of-the-year lists from the likes of Pitchfork\, the New Yo
 rk Times\, and Rolling Stone – with What Now\, drawing an immense and in
 delible power from endless unpredictability. Over the course of its 12 tra
 cks\, Howard brings her singular musicality to a shapeshifting sound encom
 passing everything from psychedelia and dance music to dream-pop and avant
 -jazz—a fitting backdrop for an album whose lyrics shift from unbridled 
 outpouring to incisive yet radically idealistic commentary on the state of
  the human condition. At turns galvanizing\, cathartic\, and wildly soul-e
 xpanding\, the result is a monumental step forward for one of the most ess
 ential artists of our time. Like Jaime (whose celebratory single “Stay H
 igh” earned a Grammy for Best Rock Song)\, What Now finds Howard taking 
 the helm as producer and working closely with engineer/co-producer/co-mixe
 r Shawn Everett (Beck\, The War on Drugs). Recorded at the legendary Sound
  Emporium and the historic RCA Studio B in Nashville\, the album emerged t
 hrough a deliberately free-flowing process\, with Howard doubling down on 
 the unfettered creativity that’s long defined her work. “I don’t eve
 r plan too deeply\, but usually I show up with the songs almost fully form
 ed\,” she says. “With this record there was a lot of exploring sounds 
 on the spot\, and trusting that the right thing would come to us.” Despi
 te that highly exploratory approach\, many of the songs on What Now unfold
  in intricate and hyper-inventive arrangements rooted in complex rhythm pa
 tterns\, achieved with the help of musicians like Paul Horton (keys)\, Llo
 yd Buchanan (keys)\, Brad Allen Williams (Guitar)\, drummer Nate Smith (Fe
 arless Flyers\, Vulfpeck\, Paul Simon)\, and Alabama Shakes bassist Zac Co
 ckrell. “\nAll the sounds on this album are analog\, all the drums are r
 eal drums\,” Howard points out. “There’s so many different structure
 s and tones happening within the songs that it ended up being a real monst
 er to mix\, but we figured it out. In a way it’s shocking to me how it a
 ll came together.” Anchored in Howard’s inimitable and infinitely comm
 anding voice—a supreme vessel for channeling raw emotional truth—What 
 Now opens on a slow-building and rapturous track called “Earth Sign.” 
 An intimate meditation on the limitless nature of love\, “Earth Sign” 
 immediately envelops the listener in its quietly symphonic convergence of 
 musical elements: Howard’s frenetic piano work\, barbershop-quartet-insp
 ired harmonies\, otherworldly textures formed through an ingenious bit of 
 in-studio experimentation. “We were playing keyboard sounds through a sp
 eaker\, and on top of the speaker was a trash can with different metal obj
 ects attached\, and we recorded the resonance of those objects to bring in
 to the song\,” Howard reveals. A departure from the dreamy languor of 
 “Earth Sign\,” What Now’s title track takes on a potent urgency fuel
 ed by its syncopated grooves\, blistering guitar riffs\, and fiercely hone
 st lyrics (e.g.\, “I’ve been making plans that don’t include you any
 more/My heart wants to stay but I don’t know what for”). “‘What No
 w’ is maybe the truest and bluest of all the songs\,” says Howard. “
 It’s never my design to hurt anyone’s feelings\, but I needed to say w
 hat was on my mind without editing myself. I like how it’s a song that m
 akes you want to dance\, but at the same time the lyrics are brutal.”\nN
 ext\, on “Red Flags\,” Howard offers up a gloriously brooding reflecti
 on on love’s darker dimensions\, echoing the stormy intensity of her emo
 tional state by continually pulling the track into strange new directions.
  “In my past relationships\, I’ve had a tendency to see red flags as p
 art of some parade just for me—something for me to run right through wit
 hout paying any attention\,” she says. “To me ‘Red Flags’ sounds v
 ery dystopian\, which makes sense for a song that feels like end-of-times 
 as far as me emotionally maturing. It’s like a big tower fell and now I 
 have to create something new.”\nLater\, on “Prove It To You\,” What 
 Now bursts into a more euphoric mood as Howard delivers a four-on- the-flo
 or dance track spiked with her explosive guitar work. “I wanted to write
  something fun that captured the joy of a new relationship\, but also tell
  the truth about how I always feel like I don’t know what I’m doing wh
 en it comes to love.” An album deeply informed by the chaotic climate of
  modern life\, What Now looks outward on songs like “Another Day”: a s
 oulful and sublimely uplifting track preceded by an interlude in which How
 ard samples Maya Angelou’s reading of her poem “A Brave and Startling 
 Truth.” “The poem talks about how as humans we’re all powerful being
 s with the capacity to do so many wonderful things for the world and for e
 ach other\, even if that’s not what we usually focus our attention on\,
 ” says Howard. “‘Another Day’ is my way of agreeing with Maya Ange
 lou and trying to see the good in others\, trying to change my outlook des
 pite what’s shown on the news\, trying to stay strong in how I live my l
 ife.” And on “Every Color In Blue\,” What Now closes out with a gorg
 eously sprawling reverie graced with a spellbinding performance from trump
 et player Rod McGaha. “That song has to do with depression and how it ca
 n be such a horrible\, heartbreaking thing but also bittersweet\,” says 
 Howard. “Within that depth of feeling\, when you’re as low as you can 
 go\, that’s also where you find your capacity for love and for empathy. 
 It’s a heavy subject for me\, but I’ve gotten to the age where I reali
 ze that it’s a part of life and something that a lot of people deal with
 . So why not talk about it\, and why not encase it in a beautiful frame?
 ”\nIn putting the finishing touches on What Now\, Howard reached out to 
 two friends from the Nashville Center For Alternative Therapy and recorded
  their performance on crystal singing bowls\, then used those hypnotic ton
 es as a transition between each song. “This record’s definitely meant 
 to be listened to alone so you can really meditate with it\,” she says. 
 “At the end of the day I hope people use the album however they need to\
 , but I do think the gift I bring is to help people to be more introspecti
 ve and ask themselves questions. And I think with a little self-examinatio
 n\, we can learn to be kinder\, more compassionate\, more understanding of
  each other. We can see that a lot of us are going through the same shit\,
  and we all just want to be seen for who we really are.”\nMichael Kiwanu
 ka: \nBritish musician Michael Kiwanuka introduced and ingratiated himself
  with his acclaimed debut album\, Home Again. A talented\, unassuming youn
 g man of Ugandan heritage and honeyed voice\, Michael was busy making some
  of the sweetest contemporary soul music of recent years.\nWith a BRIT Awa
 rd to his name before arguably finding his own distinct space\, Michael to
 ok a decidedly left turn for the Love & Hate LP. Produced alongside Danger
  Mouse\, the record flew to number 1 in the UK\, with its otherworldly sou
 ndscapes sounding utterly both singular and sprawling\, an opus by anyone
 ’s definition. Notably\, the haunting “Cold Little Heart” featured a
 s the title music to HBO’s Big Little Lies\, introducing Michael’s mus
 ic to a whole new and appreciative audience (counting the likes of Barack 
 Obama\, Adele\, and Tyler The Creator amongst them).\nWith the benefit of 
 hindsight\, Love & Hate almost acted as a blueprint for 2019’s KIWANUKA\
 , Michael’s third and most definitive release to date\, with Danger Mous
 e and British producer Inflo back behind the glass. A complex but deeply l
 istenable and expansive expression of self-worth\, KIWANUKA reaped Michael
  the distinguished Mercury Prize in 2020\, his fourth and fifth BRIT nomin
 ations (British Male Solo Artist and British Album)\, and his first Grammy
  Award nomination for Best Rock Album. All three records have been certifi
 ed gold status in the UK alone.\nQuite how an artist begins to follow up o
 ne of “the greatest albums of the decade” (The Guardian)\, we will sur
 ely soon find out\, but Michael’s been keeping himself in good company a
 s a regular contributor and confidante of the acclaimed SAULT collective\,
  both on and off stage.\nAs we welcome him back to festival stages this Su
 mmer (where he excels\, helping to sell out Green Man in 2022 on his name
 ’s headliner reveal alone)\, what Michael delivers for his fourth act wi
 ll be hotly anticipated. An artist in its truest\, purest sense.\n \n

 groundbreaking involvement and huge accomplishments. The String Cheese Inc
 ident has been recognized for their commitment to musical creativity and i
 ntegrity\, for their community spirit\, philanthropic endeavors\, and for 
 their innovative approach to the business of music.\nWhen The String Chees
 e Incident’s growth first started gaining momentum in the 1990s\, as the
  Internet was just beginning to take hold and the major-label business mod
 el was failing\, the band decided to make music on their own terms. Since 
 then\, The String Cheese Incident has gone on to carve out a completely un
 ique approach to the business of music\; they are truly pioneers of a new 
 way of “making a band.” With the Internet as their tool\, SCI was amon
 g the first artists to disseminate information online\, such as tour dates
 \, release information\, and other news\, to their growing fan base. Rathe
 r than doing business on such terms as “the bottom line\,” SCI put the
 ir music and their fans first\, opening companies of their own\, including
  a ticketing company\, a merchandise company and a fan travel agency\, to 
 best serve their community. The band’s record label\, SCI Fidelity Recor
 ds\, has always operated under the same ideals. Even early on\, SCI Fideli
 ty embraced downloadable music and file sharing\, delivering SCI’s “On
  The Road” series\, where every show the band plays is made available fo
 r download on the Internet. Whether they realized it at the time or not\, 
 The String Cheese Incident was inventing grassroots band development. Toda
 y\, literally hundreds of bands are using some version of this same approa
 ch to build their brand.\nThe String Cheese Incident’s commitment goes w
 ell beyond their immediate community\, and even beyond the music community
  as a whole. Early on\, the band took a serious interest in giving back to
  the communities that they visited\, and they were among the first perform
 ers to encourage “Green” shows and tours. SCI’s support has helped g
 ive rise to such not for-profit organizations as Conscious Alliance and He
 adCount.\nAll the while\, The String Cheese Incident has stayed committed 
 to music as a creative endeavor\, not just in their recordings but also in
  their live performances. The list of SCI’s special guests and collabora
 tors is long and diverse. Their annual events such as Electric Forest and 
 Hulaween\, and holiday shows such as New Year’s Eve\, have helped redefi
 ne the concert experience and have garnered the band a reputation as live 
 music vibe innovators.\n
