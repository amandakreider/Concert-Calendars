 protocols are subject to change.\nRingo Starr announced details for a Nort
 h American tour with his current All Starr Band featuring Steve Lukather\
 , Colin Hay\, Gregg Rolie\, Warren Ham\, Gregg Bissonette\, and Hamish St
 uart.\nThis announcement comes on the heels of the release of Ringo’s 20
 th studio record\, What’s My Name. The title track is a rousing anthem w
 ritten by a returning All Starr Band member\, Colin Hay\, that turns a fam
 iliar chant from Ringo’s live shows into a rousing rocker sure to be a f
 uture crowd-pleaser.\nThe record is the latest in a series of heartfelt an
 d homespun records that Starr has produced in his home studio and a distin
 guished\, ever-changing yet often repeating cast of musical characters and
  friends playing along with Ringo. Those friends include Paul McCartney\, 
 Joe Walsh\, Edgar Winter\, Dave Stewart\, Benmont Tench\, Steve Lukather\,
  Nathan East\, Colin Hay\, Richard Page\, Warren Ham\, Windy Wagner\, Kari
  Kimmel and more.\nRingo also just released Another Day In The Life\, the 
 third in his series of books with Genesis Publications\, that follows the 
 sell-out success of Postcards From The Boys (2003) and Photograph (2013)\,
  and features previously unpublished collection of his photographs\, capti
 oned with his own thoughts and anecdotes.\nReflecting his love of music\, 
 travel and nature\, Another Day In The Life shows us the world as seen thr
 ough Ringo’s eyes. From Los Angeles to Tokyo and everywhere in between\,
  many of Ringo’s observational images celebrate the quirkiness of life. 
 Other photographs are taken behind the scenes during historic events\, suc
 h as Ringo’s acceptance of a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and his r
 eturn to New York’s Plaza Hotel\, 50 years after The Beatles first visit
 ed the USA. Joined by Paul McCartney\, Joe Walsh and a host of All Starr f
 riends\, in Another Day In The Life Ringo Starr shares personal moments fr
 om a legendary life in music\, and offers a unique and inspiring look at t
 he world around us. View the book at RingoStarrBook.com.\nAnd this past Sa
 turday\, November 2\, 2019 Mayor John Mirisch of Beverly Hills welcomed Si
 r Ringo Starr and Lady Starkey\, joined by family and friends\, at the ded
 ication of Starr’s “Peace & Love” sculpture – which will now perma
 nently reside at the Beverly Hills Garden Park on Santa Monica and Canon. 
 Standing eight feet tall and weighing nearly 1\,500 pounds\, the polished 
 stainless steel sculpture replicates the hand gesture Ringo adopted in 196
 9. “Peace & Love” is a message that has become synonymous with Ringo
 ’s name\, and he has dedicated his birthday\, July 7\, towards spreading
  that message – last year celebrating “Peace & Love” events in nearl
 y 30 countries around the world. Ringo hopes that this gift will be a last
 ing way to carry the message of Peace & Love forward in a place he has cal
 led home for many years.\n
