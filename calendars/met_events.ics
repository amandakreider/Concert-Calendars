  has materialized at the forefront of popular culture with a sound that’
 s as timeless as it is necessary for the times. It’s easy to sway into t
 he embrace of his breezy baritone stylings\, warm guitar sounds\, and unto
 uchable charisma. His music is also an eternal bright spot illuminated by 
 a belief that the kind of romance and love we used to see on the silver sc
 reen is still possible. At just 21-years-old\, the singer\, songwriter\, a
 nd guitarist has already enchanted audiences everywhere. His breakout sing
 le “Until I Found You” went Triple Platinum\, vaulted into the Top 25 
 of the Billboard Hot 100\, and generated over 2 billion streams powered by
  the original\, piano version\, and duet with Gold-Certified pop singer an
 d songwriter Em Beihold. He delivered much talked-about performances on Th
 e Late Show with Stephen Colbert\, The Late Late Show with James Corden\, 
 Late Night with Seth Meyers\, and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. 
 Meanwhile\, he also sold out his first-ever headline tour and earned accla
 im from Rolling Stone\, Billboard\, Vogue\, Consequence\, Grammy.com\, and
  more. He even duetted “Until I Found You” with Sir Elton John during 
 his last show ever headlining Glastonbury.\nLast year\, he spun a story un
 like anything you’ve ever heard on his 2023 full-length debut\, Angel Fa

  Troubadour Sanchez\,” a fictional musician who blew up in 1958 with “
 Until I Found You\,” lit up popular culture\, and fell in love with Evan
 geline in 1964. However\, his long lost debut has been unearthed 59 years

  event In Conversation with Larry David will include an informal discuss
 ion about his time on Seinfeld\, Curb\, and everything in between.\nLar
 ry David co-created “Seinfeld\,” which debuted in 1989 and ran for nin
 e seasons. As head writer and executive producer\, the pressure of deliver
 ing a weekly show led to his abuse of anabolic steroids\, which contribute
 d to his ill temper and shrunken testicles. In 1999\, HBO aired his one-ho
 ur special\, “Curb Your Enthusiasm\,” which spawned the series. In it\
 , he plays an incredibly gifted\, loveable writer who spreads bonhomie and
  good cheer to everyone fortunate enough to encounter him. During one of 
 “Curb’s” many long hiatuses\, David created two new shows\, “Girls
 ” and “Orange is the New Black.” To better understand the motivation
  of his female characters\, he began cross-dressing and moved into the Bar
 bizon Hotel for Women. He was evicted after his true identity was uncovere
 d when he evacuated naked from a fire started by his roommate who forgot t
 o unplug her curling iron. After a spiritual sabbatical in Poland\, he ret
 urned to the US in 2009 to star in Woody Allen’s comedy\, “Whatever Wo
 rks.” The movie garnered David the prestigious Gottlieb Award for “Bes
 t Actor with No Training and No Idea What He Was Doing.” Then in 2013\, 
 he co-wrote and starred in the HBO Films’ comedy\, “Clear History\,”
  elevating him to cult hero status amongst illiterates and diabetics. In 2
 015\, he made his Broadway debut at the Cort Theater as an actor and playw
 right in “Fish in the Dark\,” which he penned over a three-day span wh
 ile sitting on the toilet. The play broke all Broadway records for most co
 ughing by an audience during a performance. He’s currently pursuing his 
 real estate license and can be contacted through the Inland Empire branch 
 of “Century 21.”\n

 t/\n\nDoors at 6:00 pm\nShow starts at 7:00 pm\n\n\nThe past three decades
  have written a story packed full of surreal experiences\, epic moments\, 
 groundbreaking involvement and huge accomplishments. The String Cheese Inc
 ident has been recognized for their commitment to musical creativity and i
 ntegrity\, for their community spirit\, philanthropic endeavors\, and for 
 their innovative approach to the business of music.\nWhen The String Chees
 e Incident’s growth first started gaining momentum in the 1990s\, as the
  Internet was just beginning to take hold and the major-label business mod
 el was failing\, the band decided to make music on their own terms. Since 
 then\, The String Cheese Incident has gone on to carve out a completely un
 ique approach to the business of music\; they are truly pioneers of a new 
 way of “making a band.” With the Internet as their tool\, SCI was amon
 g the first artists to disseminate information online\, such as tour dates
 \, release information\, and other news\, to their growing fan base. Rathe
 r than doing business on such terms as “the bottom line\,” SCI put the
 ir music and their fans first\, opening companies of their own\, including
  a ticketing company\, a merchandise company and a fan travel agency\, to 
 best serve their community. The band’s record label\, SCI Fidelity Recor
 ds\, has always operated under the same ideals. Even early on\, SCI Fideli
 ty embraced downloadable music and file sharing\, delivering SCI’s “On
  The Road” series\, where every show the band plays is made available fo
 r download on the Internet. Whether they realized it at the time or not\, 
 The String Cheese Incident was inventing grassroots band development. Toda
 y\, literally hundreds of bands are using some version of this same approa
 ch to build their brand.\nThe String Cheese Incident’s commitment goes w
 ell beyond their immediate community\, and even beyond the music community
  as a whole. Early on\, the band took a serious interest in giving back to
  the communities that they visited\, and they were among the first perform
 ers to encourage “Green” shows and tours. SCI’s support has helped g
 ive rise to such not for-profit organizations as Conscious Alliance and He
 adCount.\nAll the while\, The String Cheese Incident has stayed committed 
 to music as a creative endeavor\, not just in their recordings but also in
  their live performances. The list of SCI’s special guests and collabora
 tors is long and diverse. Their annual events such as Electric Forest and 
 Hulaween\, and holiday shows such as New Year’s Eve\, have helped redefi
 ne the concert experience and have garnered the band a reputation as live 
 music vibe innovators.\n

DESCRIPTION:Info: https://themetphilly.com/event/david-gray-3/\n\nDoors at
  7:00 pm\nShow starts at 8:00 pm\n\n\nDoors open at 7:00p.m.\nThrough days
  like empty fields after the harvest / This ache where the heart is / Like
  a tree that’s bare\, ’neath a sky that’s starless / Like something 
 out of place / I feel all used up\, I feel tarnished / Like smudged eyelin
 er\, chipped nail varnish / Like something scarcely visible garnished / Wi
 th a face … \nAudacious rhymes cascade over glitchy electronic beats and
  shimmering acoustic guitars. A soulful\, yearning voice reaches for the s
 kies.\nDavid Gray is back doing what he does better than almost anyone\, a
 nd fans of complex\, serious\, lyrical songcraft should rejoice. Dear Life
  may be the deepest\, strangest\, loveliest album this pioneering British 
 singer-songwriter has ever delivered. Years in the making\, it is an album
  of emotional crisis and resolution\, mortality and faith\, reality and il
 lusion\, love and heartbreak\, magic\, science\, loss and acceptance.\nAcc
 ording to its creator\, “A lot has happened to me. There’s been change
  on so many levels\, all the ups and downs and dramas and tragedies and jo
 ys that the slow movement through life brings. This record has been a reck
 oning with stuff that’s been building up like static for years. But I sa
 y this with joy and a smile on my face. I know what I’ve done is as good
  as anything I could possibly do.”\nFor a multi-million selling arena ar
 tist who made one of the bestselling British albums of the 21st century\, 
 David Gray is perhaps a little misunderstood. The blockbuster White Ladder
  (first released in 1998 on his own kitchen sink IHT label) took years to 
 break through\, pushing his intense and passionate blend of acoustics and 
 electronica into the pop spotlight. After Gray came the singer-songwriter 
 deluge: Ed Sheeran has admitted “White Ladder moulded me as an artist an
 d a fan.” But whilst huge stars from Adele to Hozier have acknowledged G
 ray’s profound impact and influence\, Gray himself has continued to plou
 gh his own furrow\, relentlessly seeking out a purity of artistic expressi
 on. The work matters deeply to him. “What I want is something that when 
 you touch it\, you know it’s real\,” is how David puts it.\nDear Life 
 is Gray’s 13th album\, featuring 15 new songs. It is the result of “a 
 starburst of songwriting … it just seemed like the gods of songwriting w
 ere being kind. The doubting voices didn’t turn up.” He “relished th
 e whole writing process\, the words were ravishing to me\, the rhyming sch
 emes were fresh and new.” By his own admission\, it is his “most lyric
 al record” but working closely with producer Ben de Vries\, he was deter
 mined to ensure that “the music makes space for the words. Everything is
  very melodically strong and positive\, so the record isn’t overly wordy
 \, or dense or inward looking.”\nDear Life contemplates “the beautiful
  thing that we all treasure\,” with a suggestion of a formal address –
  as if the writer is composing a letter to life itself. Some songs tenderl
 y grapple with relationship choices and consequences (“After The Harvest
 ”\, “Sunlight on Water”\, “The First Stone”)\, some face mortali
 ty and loss (“Eyes Made Rain”\, “Leave Taking”\, “That Day Must 
 Surely Come”)\, some boldly tackle the biggest questions of existence: t
 he unknowable nature of love (“I Saw Love”)\, our place in the univers
 e (“The Only Ones”)\, the prospect of apocalyptic change (“Future Br
 ide”). There is a playfulness at work (“Singing for the Pharaoh” fin
 ds Gray wittily interrogating his vocation\, whilst “Fighting Talk” co
 nfronts his Celtic argumentativeness) and a strong female presence through
 out\, with vocals from David’s musician daughter Florence Gray on severa
 l songs\, and a punchy duet with rising star Talia Rae on first single\, 
 “Plus & Minus.”\nDavid Gray is a songwriter’s songwriter\, one of th
 ose rare artists who can express themselves as fully through lyrics as thr
 ough melody\, a richly poetic wordsmith with vast musical flair. Dear Life
  is a big statement\, the work of a driven man obsessively focussed on a p
 ersonal artistic journey. “I’m feeling very joyful about the act of ma
 king and sharing this music – and privileged to be doing so. But also st
 rengthened – because I know that what I’ve done is as good as anything
  I can possibly ever do. I don’t know what people will make of it. But I
  have the same hopes and dreams whenever I release a record – that if yo
 u try and do something special\, then maybe something magical will happen 
 in return.”\n

 t 6:30 pm\nShow starts at 7:30 pm\n\n\nDoors open at 6:30pm\nFive Dice\, A
 ll Threes is a record of uncommon intensity and tenderness\, communal exor
 cism and personal excavation. These are\, of course\, qualities that fans 
 have come to expect from Bright Eyes\, nearly three decades into their car
 eer. The tight-knit band of Conor Oberst\, Mike Mogis\, and Nate Walcott t
 ends to operate in distinct sweeping movements: each unique in its sound a
 nd story but unified by a sense of ambition and ever-growing emotional sta
 kes. Even with this rich history behind them\, these new songs exude a vis
 ceral thrill like nothing they have attempted before. Oberst has always su
 ng in a voice that conveys a sense of life-or-death gravity. At times thro
 ughout Five Dice\, All Threes\, you may feel worried for him\; other times
 \, he may seem like the only one with the clarity to get us out of this me
 ss. \nOn the self-produced Five Dice\, All Threes\, Bright Eyes embrace t
 he elusive quality that has made them so enduring and influential across g
 enerations and genres\, bringing their homespun sound from an Omaha bedroo
 m to devoted audiences around the world. In Oberst’s songwriting lies a 
 promise that our loneliest thoughts and feelings can take on grander shape
 s when passed between friends\, blasted through speakers\, or shouted amon
 g crowds. This time around\, the band invites such like-minded voices onto
  the record with them\, with notable guest appearances from Cat Power (“
 All Threes”)\, The National’s Matt Berninger (“The Time I Have Left
 ”)\, and Alex Orange Drink\, the frontman of the New York punk band The 
 So So Glos\, who co-wrote several songs and shares a climactic verse in th
 e surging “Rainbow Overpass.”\nDespite this range of collaborators\, F
 ive Dice\, All Threes is as confessional and unguarded as Oberst has sound
 ed in years. Throughout these timelessly constructed yet unabashedly moder
 n songs\, he earns his place among a rare class of songwriters who have gr
 own more fearless and boundless with age. In the scenic “Bas Jan Ader”
 —which takes its title from the 20th century Dutch performance artist wh
 ose final act found him sailing into the Atlantic Ocean\, never to return
 —his writing traces the course of a bad memory smoothing out to invite t
 he onset of nostalgia. “I never thought I’d see 45\,” he sings to a 
 lapping\, chiming melody. “How is it that I’m still alive?” For an a
 rtist who has explored unflinching questions of mortality since his teen y
 ears\, the writing on Five Dive\, All Threes conveys a new sense of urgenc
 y—and empathy\, too. \n“For whatever reason\, I was born with a brain
  that’s preoccupied with that kind of thing\,” Oberst says of his life
 long penchant for dark subject matter. “When I was young\, there was a p
 erformative aspect to it\, which got reflected back at me. Now I’m at a 
 point where I don’t care what the reaction is going to be. Before it was
  a little out of my hands—I didn’t know how to write if it wasn’t sp
 ecific to my actual life. Now I do it by choice.”\nThroughout these refl
 ections on the American landscape\, Oberst shuttles us from Los Angeles to
  New York: two cities he has called home and the locations for his recent 
 series of rapturously received\, career-spanning solo residencies. Along t
 he course of his journey\, he takes shots at tech billionaires and the ris
 e of artificial intelligence\; he offers heartfelt wisdom and slips into c
 lipped\, surrealist imagery that earns its place among namechecked literar
 y heroes like Vladimir Nabokov and Mark Twain. \nFor every striking turn 
 in his lyrics\, the band knows just how to complement him. On one level\, 
 Five Dice\, All Threes may be the most fun album in the Bright Eyes catalo
 g\, filled with singalong hooks and buzzing performances. “I think it re
 visits the spirit of our older records\,” Walcott says. “There is a re
 al quality of chaos and ecstatic urgency in the performances.” And yet\,
  sitting alongside these adrenalized rockers that sound beamed in directly
  from the garage\, you will find contemplative\, psychedelic material like
  the heartbreaking “Tiny Suicides” and “All Threes\,” a song whose
  jazzy piano solo and free-associative lyrics feel totally unprecedented i
 n the Bright Eyes catalog.\nThis vivid\, cathartic music arrives four year
 s after the band’s 2020 comeback album Down in the Weeds\, Where the Wor
 ld Once Was. That record’s zoomed-out lyrics and meticulous studio atmos
 phere resonated during the peak of COVID lockdown and led to Bright Eyes
 ’ long-awaited return to the road in summer 2021. By this point\, they w
 ere also deep into their Companions project\, in which the band reissued t
 heir back catalog via new label Dead Oceans along with newly recorded rein
 terpretations of material throughout their songbook. \nIn the aftermath o
 f these exhaustive endeavors\, the band felt grateful to be back together 
 and somewhat uncertain about their future. It wasn’t until Oberst invite
 d Alex Orange Drink to stay with him in Los Angeles in winter 2023 when a 
 group of new songs started forming. At first\, these back-and-forth sessio
 ns on Oberst’s porch were just for fun. Recalling his early days of coll
 aboration and scrappy home-recording\, the pair sought to keep each other 
 entertained and inspired\, with little thought as to where the material wo
 uld take them. But after completing gems like the anthemic\, self-lacerati
 ng “Bells & Whistles” and the punky duet of “Rainbow Overpass\,” i
 t became clear that Oberst was tapping into new territory.\nWhen they hit 
 the studio with Oberst’s longtime bandmates—the multi-instrumentalist 
 and producer Mike Mogis\, the keyboardist and arranger Nate Walcott—they
  opted for a fast-paced approach that drew inspiration from formative infl
 uences like The Replacements and Frank Black. They sought textures that bu
 rst from the mix like gnarly splashes of paint on a blank canvas\; they op
 ted for first takes and spontaneous decisions. Referring to 2005’s stark
 ly produced landmark\, I’m Wide Awake\, It’s Morning\, Mogis laughs\, 
 “It took us 20 years to make another record that sounds like a band play
 ing live.” But where those songs exposed the raw beauty of the group’s
  folksier side\, Five Dice\, All Threes thrashes and squirms and resists c
 lassification. In the brilliant expanse of “El Capitan\,” they blend a
  galloping rhythm you might find in a Johnny Cash standard with a swell of
  funereal horns\, shouted vocals\, and lyrics that read like a sobering fa
 rewell between twin souls. “So they’re burning you an effigy\,” Ober
 st sings. “Well\, that happens to me all the time!”\nAs per usual\, th
 e music comes loaded with subtext that invites deep listening—the signat
 ure touch of a band who has always honored the album as its own exalted wo
 rk of art. In the background of these songs\, you can piece together a sto
 ry about love and fate and identity\, stitched together from samples of th
 e 1954 Frank Sinatra film Suddenly\, a layered orchestra of people sobbing
 \, and a game of dice that borders on cosmic and lends the album its frami
 ng device and winking title: In the game of threes\, the titular move woul
 d indicate a perfect roll. Perfection\, however\, means something differen
 t in the world of Bright Eyes\, where our flaws are what grants us authori
 ty and finding meaning is only possible if we bear witness to the dark\, w
 inding journey to get there. On Five Dice\, All Threes\, Bright Eyes embra
 ce these beliefs with music that feels thrillingly alive\, as if we were a
 ll in the room with them\, shouting along and gaining the strength to move
  forward together. It doesn’t just sound like classic Bright Eyes. It so
 unds like their future\, too.\n
