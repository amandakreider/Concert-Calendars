 . 2015’s The Story Of Sonny Boy Slim wrought hard-won international accl

 ded to greater heights with the release of This Land – his third full-le
 ngth studio album which bowed at #6 on the Billboard 200 chart\, marking h
 is third consecutive Top 10 debut. The album and single of the same name a

 and his international profile found him topping bills at legendary festiva
 ls around the world and venues including the Hollywood Bowl\, along with m
 ultiple appearances in stadiums supporting and sharing the stage with The 
 Rolling Stones. Most recently\, Clark won three more Grammy Awards\, inclu
 ding Best Rock Performance and Best Rock Song for “This Land\,” and Be
 st Contemporary Blues Album for This Land. Clark also performed his award-
 winning single “This Land” backed by The Roots at the 2020 Grammy Awar

 ors at 6:00 pm\nShow starts at 7:00 pm\n\n\nSupport: Walk off the Earth\nD
 oors at 6:00p.m.\nFew artists embody boundless creativity quite like Linds
 ey Stirling. Not only a multi-award-= winning musician known for her genre
 -bending virtuosity on electronic violin\, she’s endlessly dazzled audie
 nces with her extraordinary talents as a dancer—an element she brings to
  the stage as part of her spectacular live show\, touring with a stunning 
 frequency and continually selling out iconic venues all around the world. 
 Also a New York Times bestselling author (and creator of her own comic boo
 k)\, the platinum-selling star felt compelled to push her boundaries even 
 further for her seventh full-length effort\, ultimately embracing a whole 
 new level of freedom in her songwriting. A visionary meditation on inner w
 isdom\, personal strength\, and the ever-shifting nature of identity\, Dua
 lity arrives as Stirling’s most sonically daring and emotionally complex
  album date.\nMade with producers/co-writers like Graham Muron (Thirty Sec
 onds to Mars\, Skrillex) and Lucky West (Walk the Moon\, Dreamers)\, Duali
 ty encompasses a dozen songs showcasing Stirling’s refined musicality an
 d gift for sculpting deeply expressive melodies. But while the album’s f
 irst half centers on a grandiose and elaborately composed sound informed b
 y Celtic music and other global influences\, its latter half leans toward 
 a boldly original form of left-of center pop. To that end\, side A include
 s such tracks as “Eye Of The Untold Her\,” a gloriously epic piece pro
 duced by Mako (a musician/songwriter/producer whose credits include co pro
 ducing top-selling releases from video-game giant Riot Games) and co-writt
 en with Steve Mazzaro (a composer who’s worked with the legendary Hans Z
 immer to arrange and produce the music for the Oscar winner’s world tour
 s). Meanwhile\, side B spotlights Stirling’s pop sensibilities on songs 
 like the luminous “Inner Gold” (featuring alt-pop artist Royal & the S
 erpent) and “Survive” (on which Walk off the Earth vocalist Sarah Blac
 kwood joins in for an interpolation of Gloria Gaynor’s disco classic “
 I Will Survive”).\nA profoundly imaginative songwriter whose past work i
 ncludes such high-concept albums as 2019’s Artemis—a No. 1 on Billboar
 d’s Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart—Stirling makes brilliant use of 
 Duality’s extravagant soundscape by exploring intricate questions of int
 uition and truth. “I’ve always felt that we’re all magical beings wi
 th so much spirit and potential\, but we live in a world of expectations a
 nd rules that often makes us feel so constrained\,” Stirling says. “I 
 hope that in some way these songs help people to feel free and empowered a
 nd more connected to their truest selves. I’d love to remind everyone th
 at even though the world tries to tame us\, that magic is always there wit
 hin you.”\n

 ________________________________________\nAs NPR writes\, “siblings Clyd
 e and Gracie Lawrence are not your typical pair.” Clyde Lawrence and Gra
 cie Lawrence have been writing songs and listening to countless Stevie Won
 der\, Randy Newman\, and Aretha Franklin records in their family’s New Y
 ork City apartment since they were little kids. After years of playing tog
 ether\, they officially created Lawrence\, an eight-piece soul-pop band co
 mprised of musician friends from childhood and college. The band has since
  gained a devoted following for its high-energy\, keyboard-driven sound\, 
 which features tight\, energetic horns and explosive lead vocals.\nIn July
  2021\, Lawrence released their new album\, Hotel TV\, and became the firs
 t band to release music under Beautiful Mind Records\, the label of Grammy
 -winning producer/songwriter/artist Jon Bellion\, who co-produced and co-w
 rote the songs on the album. The tracks on Hotel TV have garnered tens of 
 millions of streams across all platforms and have had multiple viral momen
 ts on Tik Tok and Instagram. The album’s lead single\, “Don’t Lose S
 ight\,” was featured in an international Microsoft commercial\, which pr
 opelled it into the Top 20 on the USA Shazam Pop Charts\, and also hit #33
  on Top 40. The band performed “Don’t Lose Sight” on Jimmy Kimmel Li
 ve\, did a performance of it for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\, and 
 closed both of their sets at Coachella with it (with the entire audience s
 inging along)! The band is working on a new album\, and their most recent 
 single\, “23” came out in November 2023. They played “23” and othe
 r new music live during their set at Jingle Ball in 2023.\nTouring has bee
 n a key component of the group’s rise to success\; In 2023\, the band jo
 ined Jonas Brothers on their four month\, sixty-five show tour across Nort
 h America. The release of Hotel TV was also supported by the Hotel TV Tour
 \, a 53-city tour across major cities in North America\, including sold ou
 t shows at Terminal 5 in New York City\, House of Blues in Chicago\, and t
 wo nights at the Royale in Boston\, among others. The band is releasing a 
 docuseries from their adventures on the road of their Hotel TV Tour\, airi
 ng throughout the summer and fall of 2023 on YouTube. The band followed th
 eir Hotel TV Tour with a co-headline tour with MisterWives\, and then ende
 d 2022 with their first ever Lawrence festival entitled “Staycation\,”
  which featured three nights of sold out headlines shows at Brooklyn Steel
 \, which they curated with numerous special guests and non-repeating sets.
  Lawrence also completed a headline tour across Europe in March with sold 
 out shows in London\, Paris and Amsterdam. In addition to directly support
 ing the Jonas Brothers on their 2023 North America tour\, they’ve also t
 oured with acts such as Lake Street Dive\, Vulfpeck\, Jon Bellion\, Jacob 
 Collier\, Soulive\, O.A.R.\, and Bernhoft\, and has appeared at major fest
 ivals including Coachella\, Bonnaroo\, Outside Lands\, Firefly\, Okeechobe
 e\, Hangout\, and Summerfest. They have performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live\, T
 he Late Show with Stephen Colbert\, The Today Show & NBC’s Last Call wit
 h Carson Daly.\nIn addition to creating music\, in December 2022\, Clyde L
 awrence (lead vocals\, keyboards) wrote an article published by the New Yo
 rk Times regarding the unfair dynamics that artists face in the live music
  industry as a result of the merging of Ticketmaster and Live Nation. In J
 anuary 2023\, Clyde Lawrence and Jordan Cohen (saxophone\, tour manager) w
 ere invited to testify at a U.S. Senate Judiciary hearing in Washington\, 
 D.C.\, on the topic of live event ticketing. They sat alongside other indu
 stry professionals\, as well as antitrust experts\, to deliver a testimony
  about their experiences as a touring band playing in Live Nation-owned ve
 nues across the U.S. Lawrence and Cohen continue to spread the word about 
 the challenges in the live event promotion and ticketing space in conversa
 tions with outlets like NBC News\, Vice News\, Politico\, and more. In 202
 4\, the band will enter a new era – Family Business. In January\, Lawren
 ce announces their upcoming fourth studio album\, Family Business\, releas
 ing mid 2024\, along with their biggest headline tour yet across Europe (S
 ummer 2024) and North America (Fall 2024).\n
