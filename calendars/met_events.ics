 TE BAGS. NO OTHER TYPES OF BAGS WILL BE ALLOWED. ALL BAGS OVER 12″x12″
 x6″ ARE PROHIBITED.\nOnce pronounced by Bob Dylan as America’s “grea
 test living poet\,” acclaimed singer-songwriter Smokey Robinson’s care
 er spans over 4 decades of hits. He has received numerous awards including
  the Grammy Living Legend Award\, NARAS Lifetime Achievement Award\, Honor
 ary Doctorate (Howard University)\, Kennedy Center Honors and the National
  Medal of Arts Award from the President of the United States. He has also 
 been inducted into the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters
 ’ Hall of Fame.\nBorn and raised in Detroit\, Michigan\, Robinson founde
 d The Miracles while still in high school. The group was Berry Gordy’s f
 irst vocal group\, and it was at Robinson’s suggestion that Gordy starte
 d the Motown Record dynasty. Their single of Robinson’s “Shop Around
 ” became Motown’s first #1 hit on the R&B singles chart. In the years 
 following\, Robinson continued to pen hits for the group including “You
 ’ve Really Got a Hold on Me\,” “Ooo Baby Baby\,” “The Tracks of 
 My Tears\,” “Going to a Go-Go\,” “More Love\,” “Tears of a Clo
 wn” (co-written with Stevie Wonder)\, and “I Second That Emotion.”\n
 The Miracles dominated the R&B scene throughout the 1960’s and early 70
 ’s and Robinson became Vice President of Motown Records serving as in-ho
 use producer\, talent scout and songwriter.\nIn addition to writing hits f
 or the Miracles\, Robinson wrote and produced hits for other Motown greats
  including The Temptations\, Mary Wells\, Brenda Holloway\, Marvin Gaye an
 d others. “The Way You Do the Things You Do\,” “My Girl\,” “Get 
 Ready\,” “You Beat Me to the Punch\,” “Don’t Mess with Bill\,”
  “Ain’t That Peculiar\,” and “My Guy” are just a few of his song
 writing triumphs during those years.\nJohn Lennon of The Beatles made coun
 tless remarks regarding Robinson’s influence on his music. The Beatles h
 ad recorded Robinson and The Miracles’ “You’ve Really Got A Hold On 
 Me” in 1963 and in 1982 another popular British group\, The Rolling Ston
 es covered the Robinson and the Miracles’ hit “Going To A Go-Go.”\n\
 n\nHe later turned to a solo career where he continued his tradition of hi
 tmaking with “Just to See Her\,” “Quiet Storm\,” “Cruisin’\,
 ” and “Being with You\,” among others.\nHe remained Vice President o
 f Motown records until the sale of the company\, shaping the label’s suc
 cess with friend and mentor Berry Gordy. Following his tenure at Motown\, 
 he continued his impressive touring career and released several successful
  solo albums.\nDuring the course of his 50-year career in music\, Robinson
  has accumulated more than 4\,000 songs to his credit and continues to thr
 ill sold-out audiences around the world with his high tenor voice\, impecc
 able timing\, and profound sense of lyric. Never resting on his laurels\, 
 Smokey Robinson remains a beloved icon in our musical heritage.\n\n\n
