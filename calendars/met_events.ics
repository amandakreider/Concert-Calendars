  Hues\, Saleka\n \nGIVĒON has always used his raw\, evocative songwritin
 g to mine a confusing world for answers\, but\, lately\, he’s been fixat
 ed on a problem he can’t solve. Truth and deception\, as he sees it\, go
  hand-in-hand\, but it’s hard to untangle which is needed where effectiv
 e communication and human vulnerability are involved. “It’s one thing 
 I can’t quite figure out\,” he says. “Sometimes the truth is rewarde
 d\, and then sometimes it’s frowned upon. Do we want truth\, or do we wa
 nt a little deception to feel better?” This sort of tension is at the he
 art of GIVĒON’s work—he isn’t afraid to probe uncomfortable areas\,
  to ask hard questions. “Lie Again\,” his new single on Epic Records\,
  follows this approach\, showing off his emotional curiosity and the deep 
 warmth his songs emit.\n \nCinematic R&B arrangements match the track’s
  turmoil\, swelling and roiling as GIVĒON meditates on betrayal. “This 
 time it’s OK to lie to my face\,” he croons. “Don’t want you to sa
 y it\, just let me think it.” The mesmerizing ballad was born the day af
 ter he learned of a lover’s past infidelity. “It’s really just a tes
 tament to the phrase\, ‘Ignorance is bliss\,’” the 27-year-old expla
 ins. “Lie Again” is the second offering from his upcoming debut LP aft
 er September’s swoon-worthy heartbreak anthem “For Tonight\,” which 
 has gone Gold in the U.S. That song finds GIVĒON indulging in what feels 
 right in the moment even it it’s not what’s right for him in the long 
 run.\n \n“I’m in my 20s\,” he says. “There’s so much I have to 
 learn. I don’t think I’ll ever make a song where I have a fixed long-t
 erm answer. It’ll always be something impulsive or spontaneous.”\n \n
 But few of the decisions GIVĒON has made so far in his career feel hasty\
 , though his ascent has been rapid. “I wait until I have something to sa
 y before I say anything\,” he explains. Luckily\, his success so far spe
 aks for itself. GIVĒON is nominated for six Grammys at the 64th ceremony\
 , including best R&B song for “Heartbreak Anniversary”—his first-eve
 r Billboard Hot 100 smash\, from his March 2020 debut EP Take Time—and f
 our nods as a featured vocalist on Justin Bieber’s enduring hit “Peach
 es.” GIVĒON’s March 2021 compilation When It’s All Said and Done…
  Take Time became his first Top 10 album on the Billboard 200\, debuting a
 t No. 5. But for his part\, In an industry overwhelmed by instant gratific
 ation and streaming numbers\, artistic development remains a pillar for GI
 VĒON. He wants to tell stories\, not just write songs.\n \nThat nuanced 
 mindset traces back to a nurturing upbringing in Eastside\, Long Beach\, C
 alifornia. GIVĒON’s mother shielded him and his brothers from the area
 ’s gang culture\, and encouraged him to sing. “My mom is one of the on
 ly people who has 100 percent of me\,” he says. Because she believed in 
 his voice\, he began expressing more and more of his authentic self to oth
 ers.\n \nHis confidence drooped once puberty drastically dropped his regi
 ster\, though\, until discovering baritone icons like Barry White and Fran
 k Sinatra empowered him to embrace his gift. “I want to come off as a cl
 assic artist\,” he says. “That’s the word I always go back to: class
 ic.” He studied creative writing at a community college\, and waited tab
 les at Bubba Gump Shrimp Company in downtown Long Beach for five years. He
  thought he had hit upon his big break several times\, especially when he 
 had a chance meeting with SZA\, but nothing came to fruition until he conn
 ected with acclaimed producer Sevn Thomas (Drake\, Rihanna\, Travis Scott)
  in 2019.\n \nGIVĒON had only released two original songs in 2018 and 20
 19\, but they were powerful enough to land him a spot opening for Snoh Ale
 gra on tour. He penned “Chicago Freestyle” for his set\, which made it
 s way to Drake\, who placed it on his early 2020 mixtape Dark Lane Demo Ta
 pes. Fans got a taste of GIVĒON’s one-of-one voice and have since been 
 insatiable.\n \nLast fall\, he got to truly connect with listeners for th
 e first time on his first-ever headlining tour. Soon\, he will deepen thei
 r bond on the Coachella stage and across Europe. He could easily justify d
 ropping a string of singles to satisfy his mounting admirers\, rack up str
 eams\, and capitalize on mainstream momentum. But that wouldn’t be true 
 to himself—coasting by would be a betrayal of his potential. “All thos
 e people who are currently fans\, I’ve got to re-win them over\,” he s
 ays. “You have to make sure it’s worth the wait.” If GIVĒON’s nex
 t project is full of songs as emotional and real as “Lie Again\,” ther
 e’s no doubt it will be more than worth it.\n

 ritten by a returning All Starr Band member\, Colin Hay\, that turns a fam
 iliar chant from Ringo’s live shows into a rousing rocker sure to be a f
 uture crowd-pleaser.\nThe record is the latest in a series of heartfelt an
 d homespun records that Starr has produced in his home studio and a distin
 guished\, ever-changing yet often repeating cast of musical characters and
  friends playing along with Ringo. Those friends include Paul McCartney\, 
 Joe Walsh\, Edgar Winter\, Dave Stewart\, Benmont Tench\, Steve Lukather\,
  Nathan East\, Colin Hay\, Richard Page\, Warren Ham\, Windy Wagner\, Kari
  Kimmel and more.\nRingo also just released Another Day In The Life\, the

 h as Ringo’s acceptance of a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and his r
 eturn to New York’s Plaza Hotel\, 50 years after The Beatles first visit
 ed the USA. Joined by Paul McCartney\, Joe Walsh and a host of All Starr f
 riends\, in Another Day In The Life Ringo Starr shares personal moments fr
 om a legendary life in music\, and offers a unique and inspiring look at t
 he world around us. View the book at RingoStarrBook.com.\nAnd this past Sa
 turday\, November 2\, 2019 Mayor John Mirisch of Beverly Hills welcomed Si
 r Ringo Starr and Lady Starkey\, joined by family and friends\, at the ded
 ication of Starr’s “Peace & Love” sculpture – which will now perma
 nently reside at the Beverly Hills Garden Park on Santa Monica and Canon. 
 Standing eight feet tall and weighing nearly 1\,500 pounds\, the polished 
 stainless steel sculpture replicates the hand gesture Ringo adopted in 196
 9. “Peace & Love” is a message that has become synonymous with Ringo
 ’s name\, and he has dedicated his birthday\, July 7\, towards spreading
  that message – last year celebrating “Peace & Love” events in nearl
 y 30 countries around the world. Ringo hopes that this gift will be a last
 ing way to carry the message of Peace & Love forward in a place he has cal
 led home for many years.\n
