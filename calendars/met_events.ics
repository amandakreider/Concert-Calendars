 __________________________________________\nSince returning to the road in
  the summer of 2021\, in the guise of “Elvis Costello & The Layabouts”
 \, E.C. and The Imposters – Steve Nieve\, Pete Thomas\, Davey Faragher a
 nd augmented by Texas guitarist Charlie Sexton – have undertaken three t
 ours in the United States and one in the U.K. and northern Europe. Most re
 cently Costello played the highly-acclaimed “100 Songs and More”\, a t
 en-night engagement at the Gramercy Theater\, NYC at which he played more 
 than 230 original songs\, repeating only three titles. The shows that bega
 n in solo performance went on to spring nightly surprises\, involving ever
 ything from an ensemble including musical saw\, fiddle and Uillean pipes t
 o an eight-person Broadway vocal chorus led by M.D. Rob Mathes\, duets wit
 h jazz bassist\, Endea Owens and\, from the halfway point\, performing wit
 h Steve Nieve at the piano before adding two different horn sections\, led
  by trumpet player and arranger\, Michael Leonhart. The stand included gue
 st vocal appearances by Rebecca Lovell\, La Marisol and JSWISS and conclud
 ed with a more than three hour finale performance with the full band line-
 up.\nThe “We’re All Going On A Summer Holiday ” dates will follow tw
 o headlining appearances at the Byron Bay Bluesfest in Australia\, three n
 ights at the Sydney Opera House and a show at the Palais Theatre in Melbou
 rne. In May\, Costello and Steve Nieve will return to the concert hall sta
 ge together for the first time in twenty years\, in Reykjavik\, Iceland. F
 urther dates are planned for later in the year and will be announced short
 ly.\nSince 2018\, Costello has issued ten record releases\; the most recen
 t being\, “The Songs of Bacharach & Costello\,” a 4-CD\, 2-LP box-set 
 celebrating his nearly 30-year songwriting collaboration with Burt Bachara
 ch. It was named Best New Reissue by Pitchfork. The Grammy Award-winning E
 lvis Costello and The Imposters album “Look Now” of 2018 was followed 
 by the companion E.P.\, “Purse” while a French language E.P.\, “La F
 ace Du Pendule à Coucou” followed the album\, “Hey Clockface” – r
 ecorded in Helsinki and\, Paris. Together with co-producer\, Sebastian Kry
 s\, Costello also completed work on “Spanish Model” – an adaptation 
 of 1978’s album “This Year’s Model” with new vocals recorded in ly
 rical adaptation and translation with a cast of Latin music performers. In
  2022\, the latest Elvis Costello and The Imposters release\, “The Boy N
 amed If\,” was followed into the stores by “The Resurrection of Rust\,
 ” – the recording debut after fifty years of Rusty – the duo of Live
 rpool-based singer-songwriters\, D.P. MacManus and Allan Mayes\, accompani
 ed by The Imposters for new recordings of their 1972 repertoire including 
 two Nick Lowe compositions from his days in the band Brinsley Schwarz.\nPr
 eparations for a return to the stage in 2021 (and again in the summer of 2
 022) led to the release of “The Boy Named If (Alive at Memphis Magnetic)
 '”\, which found the band running down live arrangements of their new so
 ngs along with the Jagger/Richards song\, “Out Of Time” and Nick Lowe
 ’s 1976 Dutch release\, “Truth Drug”. The collection was completed b
 y a brand new version of “Magnificent Hurt” by the Japanese duo\, chel
 mico.\nD.P. MacManus and Lowe first met in a public house\, opposite The C
 avern in Liverpool in 1972. Lowe went on to produce “Elvis Costello’s
 ” largely ignored Stiff Records debut 45rpm\, “Less Than Zero” and t
 he subsequent failed singles releases\, “Alison” and “Red Shoes”\,
  although the same songs received more attention upon the release of his d
 ebut album\, “My Aim Is True” in July ’77 in the U.K. and in a Colum
 bia Records release late in the same year.\nBetween late 1977 and 1980\, N
 ick Lowe produced the Elvis Costello and the Attractions albums\, “This 
 Year’s Model”\, “Armed Forces”\, “Get Happy” and ‘”Trust\,
 ”. In the Spring of 1979\, Elvis Costello and the Attractions and Mink D
 eville were joined by Rockpile – featuring both Nick Lowe and Dave Edmun
 ds – and undertook a three-month package tour of the United States. At t
 his time\, Costello’s version of a song from the last Brinsley Schwarz a
 lbum\, “(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace Love & Understanding” saw it
 s first release as the B-Side of the Radar Records single\, “American Sq
 uirm”\, credited to “Nick Lowe And His Sound” with the producer seen
  on the picture sleeve seated at the mixing board of Eden Studios in tinte
 d horn-rims\, cradling a Jazzmaster guitar with a newly inlaid fretboard r
 eading\, “Costello”. The track was subsequently added to the U.S. edit
 ion of Elvis Costello and the Attractions\, third album\, “Armed Forces
 ”.\nIn 1984\, Costello took the producer’s chair for the first and onl
 y time at a Nick Lowe session for the Hi Records-informed single\, “L.A.
 F.S.” which was also included on the F-Beat Records album\, “Nick Lowe
  & His Cowboy Outfit”. In the same year\, the duo recorded the Burt Bach
 arach/Mack David/Barney Williams song\, “Baby It’s You” at Lowe’s 
 Am-Pro Studios in Shepherd’s Bush\, London\, also the location for a Box
 ing Day (1979) recording session with Lowe’s then father-in-law\, Johnny
  Cash which yielded the hit release\, “Without Love” and the Cash/Cost
 ello duet\, “We Ought To Be Ashamed”. In 1986\, Nick Lowe produced the
  Attractions’ last complete album\, “Blood & Chocolate” at Olympic S
 tudios\, before returning for a bass-playing cameo on “Hurry Down Doomsd
 ay (The Bugs Are Taking Over)” for the 1990 Warner Brothers album\, “M
 ighty Like A Rose”. In 1993 Nick Lowe (or Costello himself) played bass 
 on nine of the songs on the album\, “Brutal Youth”\, which some mistoo
 k for a full Attractions reunion. They most recently performed together la
 st summer on The Boy Named If & Other Favourites tour.\n

 ____________________________________\nOn their earthy\, jubilant new album
 \, the Columbus\, Ohio\, band Caamp examine those in-\nbetween days that m
 ake up a life — not the best or most eventful days\, certainly not the w
 orst\nor most tragic\, but those full of small pleasures and forgotten dis
 appointments. Taylor Meier\,\nthe group’s singer and primary songwriter\
 , came up with the phrase Lavender Days to describe\nthem — a phrase tha
 t struck him out of the blue\, “like a coconut out of the sky\,” he sa
 ys with a\nlaugh. Why lavender? “It’s nostalgic. It can remind you of 
 your grandmother’s perfume or\nmaybe the air freshener in your mom’s c
 ar. It can summon up all of these incredible memories\nand transport you t
 o those in-between days\, which I think everybody remembers with more\ncla
 rity than the big events.”\n\nCaamp have been writing and singing about 
 those lavender days — in tender love songs tinged\nwith melancholy and d
 etermination — ever since Meier played his first notes with bandmate\nEv
 an Westfall more than a decade ago. They met as students at Ohio Universit
 y in Athens\,\nplaying local coffeehouses and growing more committed to th
 is extracurricular project. With the\naddition of Matt Vinson on bass and 
 Joseph Kavalec on keyboards\, they built up a grassroots\nfollowing well b
 eyond the Buckeye State based on the inventiveness of Meier’s songwritin
 g\, the\nexuberance of their live performances\, and their tireless dedica
 tion to touring as much as\npossible.\n\nFrom their self-titled 2016 debut
  album to their releases of By and By in 2019 to Live From\nNewport Music 
 Hall\, “Fall\, Fall\, Fall\,” and “Officer of Love” in 2020 and La
 vender Days in 2022\,\nthe band has amassed over 1 billion streams globall
 y as well as achieved multiple #1’s at AAA\nradio. The band has headline
 d sold out shows\, including their first arena show in 2022\, and\nperform
 ed at major festivals around the world including Firefly\, Shaky Knees\, F
 orecastle\,\nOutside Lands\, Austin City Limits\, Great Escape and many mo
 re. They have also performed on national TV on Jimmy Kimmel Live!\, CBS Sa
 turday Morning and Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\n

  self–titled album was released by A&M in 1978 (after a three–song EP)
  at theheight of the punk revolution\, but its pop songwriting hooks and m
 elodies hark back to the ‘60s British Invasion. That album included the 
 track\, “Take Me I’m Yours\,” followed by a cadre of hits on the UK 
 charts including “Cool for Cats\,” “Up the Junction\,” “Pulling 
 Mussels From A Shell\,” “Black Coffee in Bed” and “Labeled With Lo
 ve.” Squeeze’s hits “Tempted\,”“Hourglass” and “853–5937
 ” (from East Side Story) made their mark in the U.S. in 1981.Squeeze dis
 banded in 1999 and reunited in 2007\, releasing three new albums since the
 n(2010’s Spot the Difference\, 2015’s Cradle to the Grave and 2017’s
  The Knowledge\,) as well asvarious solo projects from both Chris and Glen
 n. Aside from Difford and Tilbrook\, Squeeze now features keyboardist Step
 hen Large and drummer Simon Hanson (since 2007)percussionist/backing vocal
 ist Steve Smith (frontman for electronic band Dirty Vegas) alongwith pedal
 /lap steel guitarist Melvin Duffy (who joined them for the 2019 tour) and 
 OwenBiddle\, former bassist for The Roots WHO JOINED IN 2020. The band’s
  “Squeeze Songbook 2019” tour featured opening acts like KT Tunstall\,
  They Might Be Giants\, X\, Marshall Crenshaw\, the Mavericks and Leon Til
 brook in selected cities and was widely praised by critics. Two–time Roc
 k and Roll Hall of Fame Foo Fighters founder Dave Grohl even joined the ba
 nd at the Bourbon & Beyond Festival in Louisville in September 2019 to per
 form percussion on “Black Coffee in Bed.” Squeeze most recently toured
  across the U.S. in 2021 with HALL & OATES\, being the first UK band to to
 ur the US since the pandemic.\nThe Psychedelic Furs may not have invented 
 rock & roll per se\, but their influence since arriving on the post-punk s
 corched-earth landscape four decades ago has reverberated and resonated am
 ong all those who cherish the sweet-and-sour spot where rawness and romant
 icism meet. Born out of the UK rock scene and led by vocalist and songwrit
 er Richard Butler\, and his bass-wielding brother Tim\, the Furs quickly d
 eveloped as one of the premiere bands at college and alternative radio sco
 ring a multitude of major hits with “Love My Way\,” “Pretty In Pink\
 ,” “Heaven\,” “The Ghost In You\,” and “Heartbreak Beat” in 
 all releasing eight studio albums\, spawning several compilations\, a boxe
 d set\, a live concert DVD and inspiring one of the most iconic motion pic
 ture soundtracks of all time. Their latest release “Made Of Rain” beca
 me the Furs’ second highest charting UK Album ever and was prominently f
 eatured in the end of year “Best Albums” roundup in a multitude of pub
 lications worldwide. The Furs especially thrive live in concert having hea
 dlined the U.K.’s famed Glastonbury Festival\, performing at sold out gi
 gs at the California’s Hollywood Bowl and continuing to tour quite regul
 arly around the globe. The Psychedelic Furs touring lineup remains Richard
  Butler (vocals)\; Tim Butler (bass)\; Rich Good (guitar)\; Mars Williams 
 (saxophone)\; Amanda Kramer (keyboards) and Zachary Alford (drums).\n

 _______________________\n\nMyke Towers worships a good rhyme. Over the pas
 t decade\, the acclaimed rapper and singer hasgrown into one of Puerto Ric
 o’s top lyricists\, melding streetwise storytelling and massive pophooks
  into a career filled with chart–topping anthems. Towers is one of the O
 Gs of Latin trap\,breaking out in 2013 alongside rookie visionaries such a
 s Álvaro Díaz and Fuete Billete\, whochanneled the irreverence and visce
 ral songwriting of classic reggaetón with fresh flows echoingAtlanta trap
 . Hits like “La Curiosidad” and “Bandido” cemented Towers as one o
 f the all–stars ofmúsica urbana\, even earning him the nickname of Youn
 g King. Yet despite multiple LatinGrammy nominations and blockbuster cross
 overs with some of the industry’s biggest names\,Myke Towers still feels
  like his story is just beginning.\n“I’m a regular kid from Puerto Ric
 o who always dreamed of making music\,” says Towers\, whowas born in 199
 4 by the name of Michael Torres. Hailing from the neighborhood of Caimito\
 , inSan Juan\, the young Towers was raised in a family where music was a s
 afe and nourishingconstant. “We always listened to salsa\, boleros\, and
  Puerto Rican folk music\, so I’ve held a deeprespect for music all my l
 ife. If I wasn’t a singer I don’t know what I would be doing.”\nAt 1
 8 years old\, Myke Towers began uploading his first freestyles and experim
 ents toSoundCloud\, where word quickly spread about the new Boricua rap ta
 lent to watch. He releasedhis first mixtape El Final del Principio in 2016
 \; an impressively mature record ofautobiographical lyrics and boom–bap 
 beats that invoked classic rap. Three years later\, his effortsled him to 
 collaborate with Farruko on the hit single “Si Se Da\,” reuniting the 
 following year forthe viral remix of “La Playa\,” which also featured 
 a verse from Maluma. These songs were aturning point in Towers’ career\,
  as he reached broader audiences and embraced a morecommercial sound that 
 launched him into the stratosphere.\n“Those songs made people look at me
  not only as a rapper but as an artist\,” he remembers.“[Working with 
 Farruko] was like receiving an invitation to a really important party\, an
 d ofcourse I accepted.”\nIn 2020 Towers released Easy Money Baby\, an LP
  that expanded his sonic palette even furtherwith blasts of reggaetón\, d
 ancehall\, and baile funk on hits like “Diosa” and “Girl.” That sa
 meyear\, collaborations with Bad Bunny\, Nicky Jam\, Camila Cabello\, Beck
 y G and Anitta cementedhim as one of the leading names in mainstream regga
 etón\, though his heart yearned for a returnto his rap roots. Lyke Mike a
 rrived in 2021\, loaded with introspective bars and throbbing trap anddril
 l beats. Cuts like “Mírenme Ahora” and “Pin Pin” showcased Towers
  at the top of hissongwriting game\, remaining true to his artistic vision
  and complex narratives without relying oncatchy pop choruses.“Collabora
 tions are important to help you grow\, but I also need to make personal mu
 sic tounburden myself. The type of music you don’t care if it’s a hit 
 or not\,” he says. “[Lyke Mike] is aguide for rappers on the come–up
 \, or anyone out there chasing a dream. That type of music is a part of me
  and when I go too long without releasing anything in that style\, even my
  fans start\n\n\nasking for it.”\nHaving satisfied his MC’s calling\, 
 Myke Towers returns to euphoric pop on his upcoming album.The first single
 \, “Ande Con Quien Ande” with Jhay Cortez is a hard–grinding reggaet
 ón bangerdesigned for dance floor throwdowns. The new record also sources
  fresh global sounds includingAfrobeats and electropop\, perfected in the 
 studio with the help of elite producers such as Tainyand Russivn.\n“This
  is the kind of album you play from start to finish and don’t skip a sin
 gle song\,” saysTowers excitedly. “I’m in the studio every single da
 y and I like to challenge myself and play withnew rhythms. I’m at my pea
 k and working with people bringing new colors and flavors to thetable. The
  record is inspired by those times we feel like we’re wasting our time c
 hasing what wewant. But you get one life and we have to enjoy every second
  of it.\n\n
