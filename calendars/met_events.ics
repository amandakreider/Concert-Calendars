 following bag policy: BAGS NO LARGER THAN 12″X6″X12″\nNamed one of V
 ariety’s 10 Comics to Watch in 2021\, Kountry Wayne (a.k.a. Wayne Colley
 ) has garnered a loyal following from his widely popular digital sketches 
 and hilarious standup\, generating an extraordinary amount of buzz among h
 is peers within the entertainment industry as one of comedy’s most notab
 le rising stars.\n \nSince his first Facebook post in October 2014 went v
 iral\, the charismatic comic has amassed millions of followers across Face
 book and Instagram\, where fans tune in daily to his viral sketches featur
 ing original characters such as Drip and Buddy\, with cameos from notable 
 celebrities including Ludacris\, Mike Epps\, Charlamagne tha God and Lamar
  Odom\, to name a few.\n\nKeeping it real\, mining comic gold from the eve
 ryday and applying his genius for freestyling\, Wayne is a master comic s
 toryteller. In 2017 Wayne embarked on the 150-date national “Child Suppo
 rt Tour\,” selling out clubs and theaters across America. That wasn’t 
 just a clever moniker – he’s the dad of ten kids and even as he build
 s his own entertainment legacy\, he’s all about securing the future for 
 them. \n\n“My hashtag\, my mantra\, is ‘Help is On The Way!’ – th
 at’s my slogan\, I own it\, because I believe God’s got my back and yo
 ur back and whatever is stressing you out today\, it won’t last because 
 help is truly on the way\,” says Wayne\, whose endearingly funny way wit
 h English comes from growing up “Kountry” in Millen\, GA (pop. 3500)\,
  between Statesboro and Augusta. He was given what became his stage name d
 uring a stint living and going to school in Savannah in the mid-2000s. \n
 \nIn January 2020\, Wayne began his “The People’s Champ” North Ameri
 can tour\, travelling to cities across the U.S. and Canada including Miami
 \, Pittsburgh\, West Palm Beach\, Phoenix and more. In the spring of 2021\
 , Wayne performed in arenas alongside comedy heavyweight\, Mike Epps\, on 
 the “In Real Life Comedy Tour\,” ranked #1 on Pollstar’s Top Global 
 Concert Tour list. Wayne was featured on MTV’s “Wild ‘N Out” with 
 Nick Cannon\, starred in the BET original Christmas rom-com film\, “Holi
 day Heartbreak\,” and debut at #10 of The Hollywood Reporter’s Top Com
 edians List\, which includes Ricky Gervais\, D.L Hughley\, and Kevin Hart.
  Most recently\, Wayne wrapped his “Straight Out The Mud” tour present
 ed by Live Nation. \n\nWayne\, along with Kym Whitley\, currently co-hosts
  “I Love Us\,” a new comedy clip show on BET+. Additionally\, Wayne is
  set to release his first book “Help Is On The Way” in April 2023 – 
 a memoir covering everything from his childhood\, past struggles and path 
 to success. Up next\, he will be starring alongside Chloe Bailey\, Quavo\,
  Mack Wilds\, Druski\, and more\, in Universal Pictures’ “Praise This\
 ,” produced by Will Packer and directed by Tina Gordon.\n\nWith his humb
 le roots and unbridled energy\, Wayne continues to build his audience with
  cutting edge yet clean\, curse free material whose appeal transcends all 
 cultural lines and is fit for (and often draws) the whole family. All whil
 e still posting content online daily. \n

 RGER THAN 12″X6″X12″\nFor more than twenty-five years\, Bill Maher h

 her’s combination of unflinching honesty and big laughs have garnered hi
 m 41 Emmy nominations. Maher won his first Emmy in 2014 as executive produ
 cer for the HBO series\, “VICE.” In October of 2008\, this same combin
 ation was on display in Maher’s uproarious and unprecedented swipe at or
 ganized religion\, “Religulous\,” directed by Larry Charles (“Borat
 ”).\nMost recently\, Bill launched a new podcast\, “Club Random with B
 ill Maher.” The podcast records at the bar on Bill’s property in Los A
 ngeles\, called Club Random\, where he hosts hour-long\, one-on-one interv
 iews with a wide range of eclectic guests. Each episode features free flow
 ing\, longform conversations about anything and everything\, except politi
 cs. Guests have included William Shatner\, Quentin Tarantino\, Bella Thorn
 e\, Adam Carolla\, Killer Mike\, Judd Apatow\, and many more. Within a wee
 k of launching\, the podcast hit #1 on Apple Podcasts.\nIn addition to his
  television program – which has featured such visitors as President Bara
 ck Obama\, Vice President Joseph Biden\, Bernie Sanders\, Elizabeth Warren
 \, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\, Howard Stern\, Barbra Streisand\, Kerry Washingt
 on\, Michael Steele\, Megyn Kelly\, Ronan Farrow\, Howard Dean\, Michael M
 oore\, Eva Longoria\, Rev. Jesse Jackson\, Jim Carrey\, Gen. Wesley Clark\
 , Susan Sarandon\, Gary Hart and Pat Buchanan – Maher has written five b
 estsellers: “True Story\,” “Does Anybody Have a Problem with That? P
 olitically Incorrect’s Greatest Hits\,” “When You Ride Alone\, You R
 ide with Bin Laden\,” “New Rules: Polite\nMusings from a Timid Observe
 r\,” and\, “The New New Rules: A Funny Look at How Everybody But Me Ha
 s Their Head Up Their Ass.”\nMaher started his career as a stand-up come
 dian in 1979\, and still performs at least fifty dates a year in Las Vegas
  and in sold out theaters all across the country. Bill has also been recog
 nized with numerous Emmy nominations for his stand-up specials for HBO. He
 ’s done 11 solo specials for the premium cable channel including\, “Bi
 ll Maher: Be More Cynical” (2000)\, “I’m Swiss” (2005)\, “Bill M
 aher … But I’m Not Wrong” (2010)\, and his most recent\, “Bill Mah
