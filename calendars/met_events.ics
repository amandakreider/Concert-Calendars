  self–titled album was released by A&M in 1978 (after a three–song EP)
  at the height of the punk revolution\, but its pop songwriting hooks and 
 melodies hark back to the ‘60s British Invasion. That album included the
  track\, “Take Me I’m Yours\,” followed by a cadre of hits on the UK
  charts including “Cool for Cats\,” “Up the Junction\,” “Pulling
  Mussels From A Shell\,” “Black Coffee in Bed” and “Labeled With L
 ove.” Squeeze’s hits “Tempted\,” “Hourglass” and “853–5937
 ” (from East Side Story) made their mark in the U.S. in 1981. Squeeze di
 sbanded in 1999 and reunited in 2007\, releasing three new albums since th
 en (2010’s Spot the Difference\, 2015’s Cradle to the Grave and 2017
 ’s The Knowledge\,) as well as various solo projects from both Chris and
  Glenn. Aside from Difford and Tilbrook\, Squeeze now features keyboardist
  Stephen Large and drummer Simon Hanson (since 2007) percussionist/backing
  vocalist Steve Smith (frontman for electronic band Dirty Vegas) along wit
 h pedal/lap steel guitarist Melvin Duffy (who joined them for the 2019 tou
 r) and Owen Biddle\, former bassist for The Roots WHO JOINED IN 2020. The 
 band’s “Squeeze Songbook 2019” tour featured opening acts like KT Tu
 nstall\, They Might Be Giants\, X\, Marshall Crenshaw\, the Mavericks and 
 Leon Tilbrook in selected cities and was widely praised by critics. Two–
 time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foo Fighters founder Dave Grohl even joine
 d the band at the Bourbon & Beyond Festival in Louisville in September 201
 9 to perform percussion on “Black Coffee in Bed.” Squeeze most recentl
 y toured across the U.S. in 2021 with HALL & OATES\, being the first UK ba
 nd to tour the US since the pandemic.\nThe Psychedelic Furs may not have i
 nvented rock & roll per se\, but their influence since arriving on the pos
 t-punk scorched-earth landscape four decades ago has reverberated and reso
 nated among all those who cherish the sweet-and-sour spot where rawness an
 d romanticism meet. Born out of the UK rock scene and led by vocalist and 
 songwriter Richard Butler\, and his bass-wielding brother Tim\, the Furs q
 uickly developed as one of the premiere bands at college and alternative r
 adio scoring a multitude of major hits with “Love My Way\,” “Pretty 
 In Pink\,” “Heaven\,” “The Ghost In You\,” and “Heartbreak Bea
 t” in all releasing eight studio albums\, spawning several compilations\
 , a boxed set\, a live concert DVD and inspiring one of the most iconic mo
 tion picture soundtracks of all time. Their latest release “Made Of Rain
 ” became the Furs’ second highest charting UK Album ever and was promi
 nently featured in the end of year “Best Albums” roundup in a multitud
 e of publications worldwide. The Furs especially thrive live in concert ha
 ving headlined the U.K.’s famed Glastonbury Festival\, performing at sol
 d out gigs at the California’s Hollywood Bowl and continuing to tour qui
 te regularly around the globe. The Psychedelic Furs touring lineup remains
  Richard Butler (vocals)\; Tim Butler (bass)\; Rich Good (guitar)\; Mars W
 illiams (saxophone)\; Amanda Kramer (keyboards) and Zachary Alford (drums)

 lbum Mirror To The Sky\, YES confirmed Jay Schellen as the new permanent d
 rummer with YES\,hand-picked to step into his mentor and friend Alan White
 ’s role. “I had done the 2016 tour on my own for Alan\,” says Jay. 
 “From late 2017 onwards\, we had a beautiful partnership. I learned and 
 discovered so much about Alan’s style.His passion and creativity was phe
 nomenal. The new album has Alan’s presence all over it. It is inside of 
 us. So\, this is still\, in my heart\, Alan just being present and with us
 \, and with me\, in a big way.”\n

 \n_______________________________________________________________\nIt took
  Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats less than five years to become one 
 of the most recognizable new forces in contemporary rock ’n’ roll. Sin
 ce 2015\, Rateliff has led his denim-clad\, horn-flanked Night Sweats\, su
 pplying the zeal of a whiskey-chugging Pentecostal preacher to songs about
  this world’s shared woes. They’ve had hits\, sure\, but their combust
 ible mix of soul and rock quickly cemented them as the rare generational b
 and who balanced ecstatic live shows with engrossing and rich records. To 
 wit\, is there any other modern act capable of revving up stadium crowds f
 or The Rolling Stones while also appearing on Saturday Night Live and CMT 
 Crossroads and at NPR’s Tiny Desk in short order? When Rateliff returned
  from his pandemic-truncated solo tour in March 2020\, he struggled with t
 he same question that vexed so many of us then—what now? Fortunately\, h
 e returned to his Colorado homestead and penned a set of songs that synthe
 sized his introspection with his anthemic inclinations. The result is The 
 Future\, the third Night Sweats album but the first to capture this octet
 ’s true depth and breadth. An instant classic of 11 songs\, the album pr
 esents something more sustainable\, interesting\, and indeed open—a song
 writer and band growing into bigger questions and sounds\, into a future t
 hat allows them to remain recognizable but be so much more compelling than
  some denim-clad caricature.\n

 _______________________\n\nMyke Towers worships a good rhyme. Over the pas
 t decade\, the acclaimed rapper and singer hasgrown into one of Puerto Ric
 o’s top lyricists\, melding streetwise storytelling and massive pophooks
  into a career filled with chart–topping anthems. Towers is one of the O
 Gs of Latin trap\,breaking out in 2013 alongside rookie visionaries such a
 s Álvaro Díaz and Fuete Billete\, whochanneled the irreverence and visce
 ral songwriting of classic reggaetón with fresh flows echoingAtlanta trap
 . Hits like “La Curiosidad” and “Bandido” cemented Towers as one o
 f the all–stars ofmúsica urbana\, even earning him the nickname of Youn
 g King. Yet despite multiple LatinGrammy nominations and blockbuster cross
 overs with some of the industry’s biggest names\,Myke Towers still feels
  like his story is just beginning.\n“I’m a regular kid from Puerto Ric
 o who always dreamed of making music\,” says Towers\, whowas born in 199
 4 by the name of Michael Torres. Hailing from the neighborhood of Caimito\
 , inSan Juan\, the young Towers was raised in a family where music was a s
 afe and nourishingconstant. “We always listened to salsa\, boleros\, and
  Puerto Rican folk music\, so I’ve held a deeprespect for music all my l
 ife. If I wasn’t a singer I don’t know what I would be doing.”\nAt 1
 8 years old\, Myke Towers began uploading his first freestyles and experim
 ents toSoundCloud\, where word quickly spread about the new Boricua rap ta
 lent to watch. He releasedhis first mixtape El Final del Principio in 2016
 \; an impressively mature record ofautobiographical lyrics and boom–bap 
 beats that invoked classic rap. Three years later\, his effortsled him to 
 collaborate with Farruko on the hit single “Si Se Da\,” reuniting the 
 following year forthe viral remix of “La Playa\,” which also featured 
 a verse from Maluma. These songs were aturning point in Towers’ career\,
  as he reached broader audiences and embraced a morecommercial sound that 
 launched him into the stratosphere.\n“Those songs made people look at me
  not only as a rapper but as an artist\,” he remembers.“[Working with 
 Farruko] was like receiving an invitation to a really important party\, an
 d ofcourse I accepted.”\nIn 2020 Towers released Easy Money Baby\, an LP
  that expanded his sonic palette even furtherwith blasts of reggaetón\, d
 ancehall\, and baile funk on hits like “Diosa” and “Girl.” That sa
 meyear\, collaborations with Bad Bunny\, Nicky Jam\, Camila Cabello\, Beck
 y G and Anitta cementedhim as one of the leading names in mainstream regga
 etón\, though his heart yearned for a returnto his rap roots. Lyke Mike a
 rrived in 2021\, loaded with introspective bars and throbbing trap anddril
 l beats. Cuts like “Mírenme Ahora” and “Pin Pin” showcased Towers
  at the top of hissongwriting game\, remaining true to his artistic vision
  and complex narratives without relying oncatchy pop choruses.“Collabora
 tions are important to help you grow\, but I also need to make personal mu
 sic tounburden myself. The type of music you don’t care if it’s a hit 
 or not\,” he says. “[Lyke Mike] is aguide for rappers on the come–up
 \, or anyone out there chasing a dream. That type of music is a part of me
  and when I go too long without releasing anything in that style\, even my
  fans start\n\n\nasking for it.”\nHaving satisfied his MC’s calling\, 
 Myke Towers returns to euphoric pop on his upcoming album.The first single
 \, “Ande Con Quien Ande” with Jhay Cortez is a hard–grinding reggaet
 ón bangerdesigned for dance floor throwdowns. The new record also sources
  fresh global sounds includingAfrobeats and electropop\, perfected in the 
 studio with the help of elite producers such as Tainyand Russivn.\n“This
  is the kind of album you play from start to finish and don’t skip a sin
 gle song\,” saysTowers excitedly. “I’m in the studio every single da
 y and I like to challenge myself and play withnew rhythms. I’m at my pea
 k and working with people bringing new colors and flavors to thetable. The
  record is inspired by those times we feel like we’re wasting our time c
 hasing what wewant. But you get one life and we have to enjoy every second
  of it.\n\n

 ______________________________________\nBefore Lil Tjay– an NYC–born 2
 1–year–old – became an internet heartthrob with streams in the multi
 –millions\, he was just a kid from the Bronx. A closer listen offers the
  biography of a kid who survived adult sins and consequences before he was
  old enough to drive. Raised in an NYC neighborhood saturated with gang cu
 lture and deficient of positivity\, Lil Tjay eventually earned himself a y
 ear of incarceration. Upon release\, he committed himself to finding legal
  routes toward his music dreams. The studio would be his saving grace and 
 destiny. His first recording birthed the heartless yet catchy “Resume.
 ” Soon after\, the flammable “Brothers” would earn him his first Int
 ernet smash. He’s since had collaborations with a handful of prominent m
 usicians such as YG\, Pop Smoke\, Tory Lanez & 6LACK. In fact\, Lil Tjay r
 eleased his ground–breaking single “Calling My Phone” which topped m
 ultiple streaming charts with 6Lack. He then followed up the viral track w
 ith his highly anticipated sophomore album Destined 2 Win in April 2021\, 
 which debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 chart. Tjay survived a near–
 fatal shooting in 2022 and is back with a vengeance\, with plans to have 2
 023 be a huge year filled with new music.\n
