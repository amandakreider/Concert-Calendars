 S NO LARGER THAN 12″X6″X12″\nFor more than twenty-five years\, Bill 
 Maher has set the boundaries of where funny\, political talk can go on Ame
 rican television. First on “Politically Incorrect” (Comedy Central\, A
 BC\, 1993-2002)\, and for the last nineteen years on HBO’s “Real Time\
 ,” Maher’s combination of unflinching honesty and big laughs have garn
 ered him 41 Emmy nominations. Maher won his first Emmy in 2014 as executiv
 e producer for the HBO series\, “VICE.” In October of 2008\, this same
  combination was on display in Maher’s uproarious and unprecedented swip
 e at organized religion\, “Religulous\,” directed by Larry Charles (
 “Borat”).\nMost recently\, Bill launched a new podcast\, “Club Rando
 m with Bill Maher.” The podcast records at the bar on Bill’s property 
 in Los Angeles\, called Club Random\, where he hosts hour-long\, one-on-on
 e interviews with a wide range of eclectic guests. Each episode features f
 ree flowing\, longform conversations about anything and everything\, excep
 t politics. Guests have included William Shatner\, Quentin Tarantino\, Bel
 la Thorne\, Adam Carolla\, Killer Mike\, Judd Apatow\, and many more. With
 in a week of launching\, the podcast hit #1 on Apple Podcasts.\nIn additio
 n to his television program – which has featured such visitors as Presid
 ent Barack Obama\, Vice President Joseph Biden\, Bernie Sanders\, Elizabet
 h Warren\, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\, Howard Stern\, Barbra Streisand\, Kerry 
 Washington\, Michael Steele\, Megyn Kelly\, Ronan Farrow\, Howard Dean\, M
 ichael Moore\, Eva Longoria\, Rev. Jesse Jackson\, Jim Carrey\, Gen. Wesle
 y Clark\, Susan Sarandon\, Gary Hart and Pat Buchanan – Maher has writte
 n five bestsellers: “True Story\,” “Does Anybody Have a Problem with
  That? Politically Incorrect’s Greatest Hits\,” “When You Ride Alone
 \, You Ride with Bin Laden\,” “New Rules: Polite\nMusings from a Timid
  Observer\,” and\, “The New New Rules: A Funny Look at How Everybody B
 ut Me Has Their Head Up Their Ass.”\nMaher started his career as a stand
 -up comedian in 1979\, and still performs at least fifty dates a year in L
 as Vegas and in sold out theaters all across the country. Bill has also be
 en recognized with numerous Emmy nominations for his stand-up specials for
  HBO. He’s done 11 solo specials for the premium cable channel including
 \, “Bill Maher: Be More Cynical” (2000)\, “I’m Swiss” (2005)\, 
 “Bill Maher … But I’m Not Wrong” (2010)\, and his most recent\, 
 “Bill Maher: Live From Oklahoma“ (2018). His 12th HBO solo special\, 
 “#Adulting” aired in Spring 2022.\nMaher was born in New York City\, r
 aised in River Vale\, N.J. and went to Cornell University. He now resides

  self–titled album was released by A&M in 1978 (after a three–song EP)
  at theheight of the punk revolution\, but its pop songwriting hooks and m
 elodies hark back to the ‘60s British Invasion. That album included the 
 track\, “Take Me I’m Yours\,” followed by a cadre of hits on the UK 
 charts including “Cool for Cats\,” “Up the Junction\,” “Pulling 
 Mussels From A Shell\,” “Black Coffee in Bed” and “Labeled With Lo
 ve.” Squeeze’s hits “Tempted\,”“Hourglass” and “853–5937
 ” (from East Side Story) made their mark in the U.S. in 1981.Squeeze dis
 banded in 1999 and reunited in 2007\, releasing three new albums since the
 n(2010’s Spot the Difference\, 2015’s Cradle to the Grave and 2017’s
  The Knowledge\,) as well asvarious solo projects from both Chris and Glen
 n. Aside from Difford and Tilbrook\, Squeeze now features keyboardist Step
 hen Large and drummer Simon Hanson (since 2007)percussionist/backing vocal
 ist Steve Smith (frontman for electronic band Dirty Vegas) alongwith pedal
 /lap steel guitarist Melvin Duffy (who joined them for the 2019 tour) and 
 OwenBiddle\, former bassist for The Roots WHO JOINED IN 2020. The band’s
  “Squeeze Songbook 2019” tour featured opening acts like KT Tunstall\,
  They Might Be Giants\, X\, Marshall Crenshaw\, the Mavericks and Leon Til
 brook in selected cities and was widely praised by critics. Two–time Roc
 k and Roll Hall of Fame Foo Fighters founder Dave Grohl even joined the ba
 nd at the Bourbon & Beyond Festival in Louisville in September 2019 to per
 form percussion on “Black Coffee in Bed.” Squeeze most recently toured
  across the U.S. in 2021 with HALL & OATES\, being the first UK band to to
 ur the US since the pandemic.\nThe Psychedelic Furs may not have invented 
 rock & roll per se\, but their influence since arriving on the post-punk s
 corched-earth landscape four decades ago has reverberated and resonated am
 ong all those who cherish the sweet-and-sour spot where rawness and romant
 icism meet. Born out of the UK rock scene and led by vocalist and songwrit
 er Richard Butler\, and his bass-wielding brother Tim\, the Furs quickly d
 eveloped as one of the premiere bands at college and alternative radio sco
 ring a multitude of major hits with “Love My Way\,” “Pretty In Pink\
 ,” “Heaven\,” “The Ghost In You\,” and “Heartbreak Beat” in 
 all releasing eight studio albums\, spawning several compilations\, a boxe
 d set\, a live concert DVD and inspiring one of the most iconic motion pic
 ture soundtracks of all time. Their latest release “Made Of Rain” beca
 me the Furs’ second highest charting UK Album ever and was prominently f
 eatured in the end of year “Best Albums” roundup in a multitude of pub
 lications worldwide. The Furs especially thrive live in concert having hea
 dlined the U.K.’s famed Glastonbury Festival\, performing at sold out gi
 gs at the California’s Hollywood Bowl and continuing to tour quite regul
 arly around the globe. The Psychedelic Furs touring lineup remains Richard
  Butler (vocals)\; Tim Butler (bass)\; Rich Good (guitar)\; Mars Williams 
 (saxophone)\; Amanda Kramer (keyboards) and Zachary Alford (drums).\n
