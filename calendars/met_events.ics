 ordance with local guidelines. Until further notice\, masks are required t
 o worn at all times for attendees\, regardless of vaccination status\, exc
 ept while actively eating or drinking.\nEntry requirements and venue proto
 cols are subject to change.\nRingo Starr announced details for a North Ame
 rican tour with his current All Starr Band featuring Steve Lukather\, Col
 in Hay\, Gregg Rolie\, Warren Ham\, Gregg Bissonette\, and Hamish Stuart.
 \nThis announcement comes on the heels of the release of Ringo’s 20th st
 udio record\, What’s My Name. The title track is a rousing anthem writte
 n by a returning All Starr Band member\, Colin Hay\, that turns a familiar
  chant from Ringo’s live shows into a rousing rocker sure to be a future
  crowd-pleaser.\nThe record is the latest in a series of heartfelt and hom
 espun records that Starr has produced in his home studio and a distinguish
 ed\, ever-changing yet often repeating cast of musical characters and frie
 nds playing along with Ringo. Those friends include Paul McCartney\, Joe W
 alsh\, Edgar Winter\, Dave Stewart\, Benmont Tench\, Steve Lukather\, Nath
 an East\, Colin Hay\, Richard Page\, Warren Ham\, Windy Wagner\, Kari Kimm
 el and more.\nRingo also just released Another Day In The Life\, the third
  in his series of books with Genesis Publications\, that follows the sell-
 out success of Postcards From The Boys (2003) and Photograph (2013)\, and 
 features previously unpublished collection of his photographs\, captioned 
 with his own thoughts and anecdotes.\nReflecting his love of music\, trave
 l and nature\, Another Day In The Life shows us the world as seen through 
 Ringo’s eyes. From Los Angeles to Tokyo and everywhere in between\, many
  of Ringo’s observational images celebrate the quirkiness of life. Other
  photographs are taken behind the scenes during historic events\, such as 
 Ringo’s acceptance of a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and his return
  to New York’s Plaza Hotel\, 50 years after The Beatles first visited th
 e USA. Joined by Paul McCartney\, Joe Walsh and a host of All Starr friend
 s\, in Another Day In The Life Ringo Starr shares personal moments from a 
 legendary life in music\, and offers a unique and inspiring look at the wo
 rld around us. View the book at RingoStarrBook.com.\nAnd this past Saturda
 y\, November 2\, 2019 Mayor John Mirisch of Beverly Hills welcomed Sir Rin
 go Starr and Lady Starkey\, joined by family and friends\, at the dedicati
 on of Starr’s “Peace & Love” sculpture – which will now permanentl
 y reside at the Beverly Hills Garden Park on Santa Monica and Canon. Stand
 ing eight feet tall and weighing nearly 1\,500 pounds\, the polished stain
 less steel sculpture replicates the hand gesture Ringo adopted in 1969. 
 “Peace & Love” is a message that has become synonymous with Ringo’s 
 name\, and he has dedicated his birthday\, July 7\, towards spreading that
  message – last year celebrating “Peace & Love” events in nearly 30 
 countries around the world. Ringo hopes that this gift will be a lasting w
 ay to carry the message of Peace & Love forward in a place he has called h
 ome for many years.\n

DESCRIPTION:Info: https://themetphilly.com/event/giveon/\n\nDoors at \nSho
 w starts at 8:00 pm\n\n\nSupport: Fana Hues\, Saleka\n \nGIVĒON has alwa
 ys used his raw\, evocative songwriting to mine a confusing world for answ
 ers\, but\, lately\, he’s been fixated on a problem he can’t solve. Tr
 uth and deception\, as he sees it\, go hand-in-hand\, but it’s hard to u
 ntangle which is needed where effective communication and human vulnerabil
 ity are involved. “It’s one thing I can’t quite figure out\,” he s
 ays. “Sometimes the truth is rewarded\, and then sometimes it’s frowne
 d upon. Do we want truth\, or do we want a little deception to feel better
 ?” This sort of tension is at the heart of GIVĒON’s work—he isn’t
  afraid to probe uncomfortable areas\, to ask hard questions. “Lie Again
 \,” his new single on Epic Records\, follows this approach\, showing off
  his emotional curiosity and the deep warmth his songs emit.\n \nCinemati
 c R&B arrangements match the track’s turmoil\, swelling and roiling as G
 IVĒON meditates on betrayal. “This time it’s OK to lie to my face\,
 ” he croons. “Don’t want you to say it\, just let me think it.” Th
 e mesmerizing ballad was born the day after he learned of a lover’s past
  infidelity. “It’s really just a testament to the phrase\, ‘Ignoranc
 e is bliss\,’” the 27-year-old explains. “Lie Again” is the second
  offering from his upcoming debut LP after September’s swoon-worthy hear
 tbreak anthem “For Tonight\,” which has gone Gold in the U.S. That son
 g finds GIVĒON indulging in what feels right in the moment even it it’s
  not what’s right for him in the long run.\n \n“I’m in my 20s\,” 
 he says. “There’s so much I have to learn. I don’t think I’ll ever
  make a song where I have a fixed long-term answer. It’ll always be some
 thing impulsive or spontaneous.”\n \nBut few of the decisions GIVĒON h
 as made so far in his career feel hasty\, though his ascent has been rapid
 . “I wait until I have something to say before I say anything\,” he ex
 plains. Luckily\, his success so far speaks for itself. GIVĒON is nominat
 ed for six Grammys at the 64th ceremony\, including best R&B song for “H
 eartbreak Anniversary”—his first-ever Billboard Hot 100 smash\, from h
 is March 2020 debut EP Take Time—and four nods as a featured vocalist on
  Justin Bieber’s enduring hit “Peaches.” GIVĒON’s March 2021 comp
 ilation When It’s All Said and Done… Take Time became his first Top 10
  album on the Billboard 200\, debuting at No. 5. But for his part\, In an 
 industry overwhelmed by instant gratification and streaming numbers\, arti
 stic development remains a pillar for GIVĒON. He wants to tell stories\, 
 not just write songs.\n \nThat nuanced mindset traces back to a nurturing
  upbringing in Eastside\, Long Beach\, California. GIVĒON’s mother shie
 lded him and his brothers from the area’s gang culture\, and encouraged 
 him to sing. “My mom is one of the only people who has 100 percent of me
 \,” he says. Because she believed in his voice\, he began expressing mor
 e and more of his authentic self to others.\n \nHis confidence drooped on
 ce puberty drastically dropped his register\, though\, until discovering b
 aritone icons like Barry White and Frank Sinatra empowered him to embrace 
 his gift. “I want to come off as a classic artist\,” he says. “That
 ’s the word I always go back to: classic.” He studied creative writing
  at a community college\, and waited tables at Bubba Gump Shrimp Company i
 n downtown Long Beach for five years. He thought he had hit upon his big b
 reak several times\, especially when he had a chance meeting with SZA\, bu
 t nothing came to fruition until he connected with acclaimed producer Sevn
  Thomas (Drake\, Rihanna\, Travis Scott) in 2019.\n \nGIVĒON had only re
 leased two original songs in 2018 and 2019\, but they were powerful enough
  to land him a spot opening for Snoh Alegra on tour. He penned “Chicago 
 Freestyle” for his set\, which made its way to Drake\, who placed it on 
 his early 2020 mixtape Dark Lane Demo Tapes. Fans got a taste of GIVĒON
 ’s one-of-one voice and have since been insatiable.\n \nLast fall\, he 
 got to truly connect with listeners for the first time on his first-ever h
 eadlining tour. Soon\, he will deepen their bond on the Coachella stage an
 d across Europe. He could easily justify dropping a string of singles to s
 atisfy his mounting admirers\, rack up streams\, and capitalize on mainstr
 eam momentum. But that wouldn’t be true to himself—coasting by would b
 e a betrayal of his potential. “All those people who are currently fans\
 , I’ve got to re-win them over\,” he says. “You have to make sure it
 ’s worth the wait.” If GIVĒON’s next project is full of songs as em
 otional and real as “Lie Again\,” there’s no doubt it will be more t
 han worth it.\n
