 ta’s Tabernacle and two shows at Toronto’s HISTORY captivated fans bot
 h old and new\, as well as appearances at Austin City Limits\, Hinterland 
 Music Festival and Telluride Blues and Brews in Colorado. Unsurprisingly t
 hey were tapped to support Greensky Bluegrass at the iconic Red Rocks Ampi
 theatre.\nThe Teskey Brothers live experience is on another level. Josh Te
 skey’s staggering soulful vocals take centre-stage while his brother Sam
  sings wondrously on a well-worn Stratocaster igniting the band around the
 m. It’s an authentic\, no-frills celebration of classic song and perform
 ed with such raw emotion that audiences are often still singing after the 
 lights go up\, out the venue doors and into the streets.\n

 oors at 6:00p.m.\nFew artists embody boundless creativity quite like Linds
 ey Stirling. Not only a multi-award-= winning musician known for her genre
 -bending virtuosity on electronic violin\, she’s endlessly dazzled audie
 nces with her extraordinary talents as a dancer—an element she brings to
  the stage as part of her spectacular live show\, touring with a stunning 
 frequency and continually selling out iconic venues all around the world. 
 Also a New York Times bestselling author (and creator of her own comic boo
 k)\, the platinum-selling star felt compelled to push her boundaries even 
 further for her seventh full-length effort\, ultimately embracing a whole 
 new level of freedom in her songwriting. A visionary meditation on inner w
 isdom\, personal strength\, and the ever-shifting nature of identity\, Dua
 lity arrives as Stirling’s most sonically daring and emotionally complex
  album date.\nMade with producers/co-writers like Graham Muron (Thirty Sec
 onds to Mars\, Skrillex) and Lucky West (Walk the Moon\, Dreamers)\, Duali
 ty encompasses a dozen songs showcasing Stirling’s refined musicality an
 d gift for sculpting deeply expressive melodies. But while the album’s f
 irst half centers on a grandiose and elaborately composed sound informed b
 y Celtic music and other global influences\, its latter half leans toward 
 a boldly original form of left-of center pop. To that end\, side A include
 s such tracks as “Eye Of The Untold Her\,” a gloriously epic piece pro
 duced by Mako (a musician/songwriter/producer whose credits include co pro
 ducing top-selling releases from video-game giant Riot Games) and co-writt
 en with Steve Mazzaro (a composer who’s worked with the legendary Hans Z
 immer to arrange and produce the music for the Oscar winner’s world tour
 s). Meanwhile\, side B spotlights Stirling’s pop sensibilities on songs 
 like the luminous “Inner Gold” (featuring alt-pop artist Royal & the S
 erpent) and “Survive” (on which Walk off the Earth vocalist Sarah Blac
 kwood joins in for an interpolation of Gloria Gaynor’s disco classic “
 I Will Survive”).\nA profoundly imaginative songwriter whose past work i
 ncludes such high-concept albums as 2019’s Artemis—a No. 1 on Billboar
 d’s Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart—Stirling makes brilliant use of 
 Duality’s extravagant soundscape by exploring intricate questions of int
 uition and truth. “I’ve always felt that we’re all magical beings wi
 th so much spirit and potential\, but we live in a world of expectations a
 nd rules that often makes us feel so constrained\,” Stirling says. “I 
 hope that in some way these songs help people to feel free and empowered a
 nd more connected to their truest selves. I’d love to remind everyone th
 at even though the world tries to tame us\, that magic is always there wit
 hin you.”\n

 ________________________________________\nAs NPR writes\, “siblings Clyd
 e and Gracie Lawrence are not your typical pair.” Clyde Lawrence and Gra
 cie Lawrence have been writing songs and listening to countless Stevie Won
 der\, Randy Newman\, and Aretha Franklin records in their family’s New Y
 ork City apartment since they were little kids. After years of playing tog
 ether\, they officially created Lawrence\, an eight-piece soul-pop band co
 mprised of musician friends from childhood and college. The band has since
  gained a devoted following for its high-energy\, keyboard-driven sound\, 
 which features tight\, energetic horns and explosive lead vocals.\nIn July
  2021\, Lawrence released their new album\, Hotel TV\, and became the firs
 t band to release music under Beautiful Mind Records\, the label of Grammy
 -winning producer/songwriter/artist Jon Bellion\, who co-produced and co-w
 rote the songs on the album. The tracks on Hotel TV have garnered tens of 
 millions of streams across all platforms and have had multiple viral momen
 ts on Tik Tok and Instagram. The album’s lead single\, “Don’t Lose S
 ight\,” was featured in an international Microsoft commercial\, which pr
 opelled it into the Top 20 on the USA Shazam Pop Charts\, and also hit #33
  on Top 40. The band performed “Don’t Lose Sight” on Jimmy Kimmel Li
 ve\, did a performance of it for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\, and 
 closed both of their sets at Coachella with it (with the entire audience s
 inging along)! The band is working on a new album\, and their most recent 
 single\, “23” came out in November 2023. They played “23” and othe
 r new music live during their set at Jingle Ball in 2023.\nTouring has bee
 n a key component of the group’s rise to success\; In 2023\, the band jo
 ined Jonas Brothers on their four month\, sixty-five show tour across Nort
 h America. The release of Hotel TV was also supported by the Hotel TV Tour
 \, a 53-city tour across major cities in North America\, including sold ou
 t shows at Terminal 5 in New York City\, House of Blues in Chicago\, and t
 wo nights at the Royale in Boston\, among others. The band is releasing a 
 docuseries from their adventures on the road of their Hotel TV Tour\, airi
 ng throughout the summer and fall of 2023 on YouTube. The band followed th
 eir Hotel TV Tour with a co-headline tour with MisterWives\, and then ende
 d 2022 with their first ever Lawrence festival entitled “Staycation\,”
  which featured three nights of sold out headlines shows at Brooklyn Steel
 \, which they curated with numerous special guests and non-repeating sets.
  Lawrence also completed a headline tour across Europe in March with sold 
 out shows in London\, Paris and Amsterdam. In addition to directly support
 ing the Jonas Brothers on their 2023 North America tour\, they’ve also t
 oured with acts such as Lake Street Dive\, Vulfpeck\, Jon Bellion\, Jacob 
 Collier\, Soulive\, O.A.R.\, and Bernhoft\, and has appeared at major fest
 ivals including Coachella\, Bonnaroo\, Outside Lands\, Firefly\, Okeechobe
 e\, Hangout\, and Summerfest. They have performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live\, T
 he Late Show with Stephen Colbert\, The Today Show & NBC’s Last Call wit
 h Carson Daly.\nIn addition to creating music\, in December 2022\, Clyde L
 awrence (lead vocals\, keyboards) wrote an article published by the New Yo
 rk Times regarding the unfair dynamics that artists face in the live music
  industry as a result of the merging of Ticketmaster and Live Nation. In J
 anuary 2023\, Clyde Lawrence and Jordan Cohen (saxophone\, tour manager) w
 ere invited to testify at a U.S. Senate Judiciary hearing in Washington\, 
 D.C.\, on the topic of live event ticketing. They sat alongside other indu
 stry professionals\, as well as antitrust experts\, to deliver a testimony
  about their experiences as a touring band playing in Live Nation-owned ve
 nues across the U.S. Lawrence and Cohen continue to spread the word about 
 the challenges in the live event promotion and ticketing space in conversa
 tions with outlets like NBC News\, Vice News\, Politico\, and more. In 202
 4\, the band will enter a new era – Family Business. In January\, Lawren
 ce announces their upcoming fourth studio album\, Family Business\, releas
 ing mid 2024\, along with their biggest headline tour yet across Europe (S
 ummer 2024) and North America (Fall 2024).\n

 .\nBrittany Howard:\nThere’s a double meaning to the title of What Now\,
  the revelatory new album from\nsinger/songwriter Brittany Howard. “With
  the world we’re living in now\, it feels like we’re all just\ntrying 
 to hang onto our souls\,” says the Nashville-based musician and frontwom
 an for four-time\nGrammy Award-winning Alabama Shakes. “Everything seems
  to be getting more extreme and\neveryone keeps wondering\, ‘What now? W
 hat’s next?’ By the same coin\, the only constant on this\nrecord is y
 ou never know what’s going to happen next: every song is its own aquariu
 m\, its own little\nminiature world built around whatever I was feeling an
 d thinking at the time.”\nWith five Grammy® wins and sixteen nomination
 s\, Howard follows up her massively acclaimed\nsolo debut Jaime—a 2019 L
 P that landed on best-of-the-year lists from the likes of Pitchfork\, the\
 nNew York Times\, and Rolling Stone – with What Now\, drawing an immense
  and indelible power\nfrom endless unpredictability. Over the course of it
 s 12 tracks\, Howard brings her singular\nmusicality to a shapeshifting so
 und encompassing everything from psychedelia and dance music to\ndream-pop
  and avant-jazz—a fitting backdrop for an album whose lyrics shift from 
 unbridled\noutpouring to incisive yet radically idealistic commentary on t
 he state of the human condition. At\nturns galvanizing\, cathartic\, and w
 ildly soul-expanding\, the result is a monumental step forward for\none of
  the most essential artists of our time.\nLike Jaime (whose celebratory si
 ngle “Stay High” earned a Grammy for Best Rock Song)\, What Now\nfinds
  Howard taking the helm as producer and working closely with engineer/co-p
 roducer/co-mixer\nShawn Everett (Beck\, The War on Drugs). Recorded at the
  legendary Sound Emporium and the\nhistoric RCA Studio B in Nashville\, th
 e album emerged through a deliberately free-flowing process\,\nwith Howard
  doubling down on the unfettered creativity that’s long defined her work
 . “I don’t ever\nplan too deeply\, but usually I show up with the song
 s almost fully formed\,” she says. “With this\nrecord there was a lot 
 of exploring sounds on the spot\, and trusting that the right thing would 
 come\nto us.” Despite that highly exploratory approach\, many of the son
 gs on What Now unfold in intricate\nand hyper-inventive arrangements roote
 d in complex rhythm patterns\, achieved with the help of\nmusicians like P
 aul Horton (keys)\, Lloyd Buchanan (keys)\, Brad Allen Williams (Guitar)\,
  drummer\nNate Smith (Fearless Flyers\, Vulfpeck\, Paul Simon)\, and Alaba
 ma Shakes bassist Zac Cockrell. “All\nthe sounds on this album are analo
 g\, all the drums are real drums\,” Howard points out. “There’s so\n
 many different structures and tones happening within the songs that it end
 ed up being a real\nmonster to mix\, but we figured it out. In a way it’
 s shocking to me how it all came together.”\nAnchored in Howard’s inim
 itable and infinitely commanding voice—a supreme vessel for\nchanneling 
 raw emotional truth—What Now opens on a slow-building and rapturous trac
 k called\n“Earth Sign.” An intimate meditation on the limitless nature
  of love\, “Earth Sign” immediately\nenvelops the listener in its quie
 tly symphonic convergence of musical elements: Howard’s frenetic\npiano 
 work\, barbershop-quartet-inspired harmonies\, otherworldly textures forme
 d through an\ningenious bit of in-studio experimentation. “We were playi
 ng keyboard sounds through a speaker\,\nand on top of the speaker was a tr
 ash can with different metal objects attached\, and we recorded the\nreson
 ance of those objects to bring into the song\,” Howard reveals.\nA depar
 ture from the dreamy languor of “Earth Sign\,” What Now’s title trac
 k takes on a potent\nurgency fueled by its syncopated grooves\, blistering
  guitar riffs\, and fiercely honest lyrics (e.g.\, “I’ve\nbeen making 
 plans that don’t include you anymore/My heart wants to stay but I don’
 t know what\nfor”). “‘What Now’ is maybe the truest and bluest of 
 all the songs\,” says Howard. “It’s never my\ndesign to hurt anyone
 ’s feelings\, but I needed to say what was on my mind without editing my
 self. I\nlike how it’s a song that makes you want to dance\, but at the 
 same time the lyrics are brutal.” Next\,\non “Red Flags\,” Howard of
 fers up a gloriously brooding reflection on love’s darker dimensions\,\n
 echoing the stormy intensity of her emotional state by continually pulling
  the track into strange new\ndirections. “In my past relationships\, I
 ’ve had a tendency to see red flags as part of some parade just\nfor me
 —something for me to run right through without paying any attention\,”
  she says. “To me\n‘Red Flags’ sounds very dystopian\, which makes s
 ense for a song that feels like end-of-times as far as\nme emotionally mat
 uring. It’s like a big tower fell and now I have to create something new
 .” Later\,\non “Prove It To You\,” What Now bursts into a more eupho
 ric mood as Howard delivers a four-on-\nthe-floor dance track spiked with 
 her explosive guitar work. “I wanted to write something fun that\ncaptur
 ed the joy of a new relationship\, but also tell the truth about how I alw
 ays feel like I don’t\nknow what I’m doing when it comes to love.”\n
 An album deeply informed by the chaotic climate of modern life\, What Now 
 looks outward on songs\nlike “Another Day”: a soulful and sublimely up
 lifting track preceded by an interlude in which\nHoward samples Maya Angel
 ou’s reading of her poem “A Brave and Startling Truth.” “The poem\
 ntalks about how as humans we’re all powerful beings with the capacity t
 o do so many wonderful\nthings for the world and for each other\, even if 
 that’s not what we usually focus our attention on\,”\nsays Howard. “
 ‘Another Day’ is my way of agreeing with Maya Angelou and trying to se
 e the good\nin others\, trying to change my outlook despite what’s shown
  on the news\, trying to stay strong in\nhow I live my life.” And on “
 Every Color In Blue\,” What Now closes out with a gorgeously\nsprawling 
 reverie graced with a spellbinding performance from trumpet player Rod McG
 aha. “That\nsong has to do with depression and how it can be such a horr
 ible\, heartbreaking thing but also\nbittersweet\,” says Howard. “With
 in that depth of feeling\, when you’re as low as you can go\, that’s\n
 also where you find your capacity for love and for empathy. It’s a heavy
  subject for me\, but I’ve\ngotten to the age where I realize that it’
 s a part of life and something that a lot of people deal with.\nSo why not
  talk about it\, and why not encase it in a beautiful frame?”\nIn puttin
 g the finishing touches on What Now\, Howard reached out to two friends fr
 om the\nNashville Center For Alternative Therapy and recorded their perfor
 mance on crystal singing bowls\,\nthen used those hypnotic tones as a tran
 sition between each song. “This record’s definitely meant to\nbe liste
 ned to alone so you can really meditate with it\,” she says. “At the e
 nd of the day I hope\npeople use the album however they need to\, but I do
  think the gift I bring is to help people to be\nmore introspective and as
 k themselves questions. And I think with a little self-examination\, we ca
 n\nlearn to be kinder\, more compassionate\, more understanding of each ot
 her. We can see that a lot of\nus are going through the same shit\, and we
  all just want to be seen for who we really are.”\nMichael Kiwanuka: \nB
 ritish musician Michael Kiwanuka introduced and ingratiated himself with h
 is acclaimed debut album\, Home Again. A talented\, unassuming young man o
 f Ugandan heritage and honeyed voice\, Michael was busy making some of the
  sweetest contemporary soul music of recent years.\nWith a BRIT Award to h
 is name before arguably finding his own distinct space\, Michael took a de
 cidedly left turn for the Love & Hate LP. Produced alongside Danger Mouse\
 , the record flew to number 1 in the UK\, with its otherworldly soundscape
 s sounding utterly both singular and sprawling\, an opus by anyone’s def
 inition. Notably\, the haunting “Cold Little Heart” featured as the ti
 tle music to HBO’s Big Little Lies\, introducing Michael’s music to a 
 whole new and appreciative audience (counting the likes of Barack Obama\, 
 Adele\, and Tyler The Creator amongst them).\nWith the benefit of hindsigh
 t\, Love & Hate almost acted as a blueprint for 2019’s KIWANUKA\, Michae
 l’s third and most definitive release to date\, with Danger Mouse and Br
 itish producer Inflo back behind the glass. A complex but deeply listenabl
 e and expansive expression of self-worth\, KIWANUKA reaped Michael the dis
 tinguished Mercury Prize in 2020\, his fourth and fifth BRIT nominations (
 British Male Solo Artist and British Album)\, and his first Grammy Award n
 omination for Best Rock Album. All three records have been certified gold 
 status in the UK alone.\nQuite how an artist begins to follow up one of
