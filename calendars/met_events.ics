 just a clever moniker – he’s the dad of ten kids and even as he build
 s his own entertainment legacy\, he’s all about securing the future for 
 them. \n\n“My hashtag\, my mantra\, is ‘Help is On The Way!’ – th
 at’s my slogan\, I own it\, because I believe God’s got my back and yo
 ur back and whatever is stressing you out today\, it won’t last because 
 help is truly on the way\,” says Wayne\, whose endearingly funny way wit

 edians List\, which includes Ricky Gervais\, D.L Hughley\, and Kevin Hart.
  Most recently\, Wayne wrapped his “Straight Out The Mud” tour present

  “I Love Us\,” a new comedy clip show on BET+. Additionally\, Wayne is
  set to release his first book “Help Is On The Way” in April 2023 – 
 a memoir covering everything from his childhood\, past struggles and path 
 to success. Up next\, he will be starring alongside Chloe Bailey\, Quavo\,
  Mack Wilds\, Druski\, and more\, in Universal Pictures’ “Praise This\
 ,” produced by Will Packer and directed by Tina Gordon.\n\nWith his humb
