 r formation in 2003\, A Day To Remember quietly emerged as arguably the bi
 ggest underground band in the world. The Florida group affirmed this statu
 s by achieving one platinum album\, one gold album\, one platinum single\,
  and four gold singles. Not to mention\, each full-length record ascended 
 to #1 on the Billboard Rock\, Indie\, and/or Alternative Charts with 2016
 ’s Bad Vibrations bowing at #2 on the Billboard Top 200. They’ve put u
 p unprecedented numbers for a rock act in the 21st century\, generating 85
 0 million Spotify streams\, 500 million YouTube views\, and sales of three
  million-plus units. They’ve also packed arenas on continental tours and
  attracted a worldwide audience consisting of millions. Additionally\, A D
 ay To Remember successfully launched their own Self Help Festival in 2014\
 , which continues going strong. Plus\, everyone from Marshmello to Pierce 
 The Veil has sought them out for collaborations. All of which explains why
  Rolling Stone called them “An Artist You Need To Know.”\n \nA Day To
  Remember is: Jeremy McKinnon (vocals)\, Alex Shelnutt (drums)\, Kevin Ska
 ff (guitar\, vocals)\, and Neil Westfall (guitar\, vocals).\n

 following bag policy: BAGS NO LARGER THAN 12″X6″X12″\nNamed one of V
 ariety’s 10 Comics to Watch in 2021\, Kountry Wayne (a.k.a. Wayne Colley
 ) has garnered a loyal following from his widely popular digital sketches 
 and hilarious standup\, generating an extraordinary amount of buzz among h
 is peers within the entertainment industry as one of comedy’s most notab
 le rising stars.\n \nSince his first Facebook post in October 2014 went v
 iral\, the charismatic comic has amassed millions of followers across Face
 book and Instagram\, where fans tune in daily to his viral sketches featur
 ing original characters such as Drip and Buddy\, with cameos from notable 
 celebrities including Ludacris\, Mike Epps\, Charlamagne tha God and Lamar
  Odom\, to name a few.\n\nKeeping it real\, mining comic gold from the eve
 ryday and applying his genius for freestyling\, Wayne is a master comic s
 toryteller. In 2017 Wayne embarked on the 150-date national “Child Suppo
 rt Tour\,” selling out clubs and theaters across America. That wasn’t 
 just a clever moniker – he’s the dad of ten kids and even as he build
 s his own entertainment legacy\, he’s all about securing the future for 
 them. \n\n“My hashtag\, my mantra\, is ‘Help is On The Way!’ – th
 at’s my slogan\, I own it\, because I believe God’s got my back and yo
 ur back and whatever is stressing you out today\, it won’t last because 
 help is truly on the way\,” says Wayne\, whose endearingly funny way wit
 h English comes from growing up “Kountry” in Millen\, GA (pop. 3500)\,
  between Statesboro and Augusta. He was given what became his stage name d
 uring a stint living and going to school in Savannah in the mid-2000s. \n
 \nIn January 2020\, Wayne began his “The People’s Champ” North Ameri
 can tour\, travelling to cities across the U.S. and Canada including Miami
 \, Pittsburgh\, West Palm Beach\, Phoenix and more. In the spring of 2021\
 , Wayne performed in arenas alongside comedy heavyweight\, Mike Epps\, on 
 the “In Real Life Comedy Tour\,” ranked #1 on Pollstar’s Top Global 
 Concert Tour list. Wayne was featured on MTV’s “Wild ‘N Out” with 
 Nick Cannon\, starred in the BET original Christmas rom-com film\, “Holi
 day Heartbreak\,” and debut at #10 of The Hollywood Reporter’s Top Com
 edians List\, which includes Ricky Gervais\, D.L Hughley\, and Kevin Hart.
  Most recently\, Wayne wrapped his “Straight Out The Mud” tour present
 ed by Live Nation. \n\nWayne\, along with Kym Whitley\, currently co-hosts
  “I Love Us\,” a new comedy clip show on BET+. Additionally\, Wayne is
  set to release his first book “Help Is On The Way” in April 2023 – 
 a memoir covering everything from his childhood\, past struggles and path 
 to success. Up next\, he will be starring alongside Chloe Bailey\, Quavo\,
  Mack Wilds\, Druski\, and more\, in Universal Pictures’ “Praise This\
 ,” produced by Will Packer and directed by Tina Gordon.\n\nWith his humb
 le roots and unbridled energy\, Wayne continues to build his audience with
  cutting edge yet clean\, curse free material whose appeal transcends all 
 cultural lines and is fit for (and often draws) the whole family. All whil

 ide with Bin Laden\,” “New Rules: Polite\nMusings from a Timid Observe
 r\,” and\, “The New New Rules: A Funny Look at How Everybody But Me Ha
 s Their Head Up Their Ass.”\nMaher started his career as a stand-up come
 dian in 1979\, and still performs at least fifty dates a year in Las Vegas
