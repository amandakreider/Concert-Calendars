 r formation in 2003\, A Day To Remember quietly emerged as arguably the bi
 ggest underground band in the world. The Florida group affirmed this statu
 s by achieving one platinum album\, one gold album\, one platinum single\,
  and four gold singles. Not to mention\, each full-length record ascended 
 to #1 on the Billboard Rock\, Indie\, and/or Alternative Charts with 2016
 ’s Bad Vibrations bowing at #2 on the Billboard Top 200. They’ve put u
 p unprecedented numbers for a rock act in the 21st century\, generating 85
 0 million Spotify streams\, 500 million YouTube views\, and sales of three
  million-plus units. They’ve also packed arenas on continental tours and
  attracted a worldwide audience consisting of millions. Additionally\, A D
 ay To Remember successfully launched their own Self Help Festival in 2014\
 , which continues going strong. Plus\, everyone from Marshmello to Pierce 
 The Veil has sought them out for collaborations. All of which explains why
  Rolling Stone called them “An Artist You Need To Know.”\n \nA Day To
  Remember is: Jeremy McKinnon (vocals)\, Alex Shelnutt (drums)\, Kevin Ska
 ff (guitar\, vocals)\, and Neil Westfall (guitar\, vocals).\n

 RGER THAN 12″X6″X12″\nFor more than twenty-five years\, Bill Maher h
 as set the boundaries of where funny\, political talk can go on American t
 elevision. First on “Politically Incorrect” (Comedy Central\, ABC\, 19
 93-2002)\, and for the last nineteen years on HBO’s “Real Time\,” Ma
 her’s combination of unflinching honesty and big laughs have garnered hi
 m 41 Emmy nominations. Maher won his first Emmy in 2014 as executive produ
 cer for the HBO series\, “VICE.” In October of 2008\, this same combin
 ation was on display in Maher’s uproarious and unprecedented swipe at or
 ganized religion\, “Religulous\,” directed by Larry Charles (“Borat
 ”).\nMost recently\, Bill launched a new podcast\, “Club Random with B
 ill Maher.” The podcast records at the bar on Bill’s property in Los A
 ngeles\, called Club Random\, where he hosts hour-long\, one-on-one interv
 iews with a wide range of eclectic guests. Each episode features free flow
 ing\, longform conversations about anything and everything\, except politi
 cs. Guests have included William Shatner\, Quentin Tarantino\, Bella Thorn
 e\, Adam Carolla\, Killer Mike\, Judd Apatow\, and many more. Within a wee
 k of launching\, the podcast hit #1 on Apple Podcasts.\nIn addition to his
  television program – which has featured such visitors as President Bara
 ck Obama\, Vice President Joseph Biden\, Bernie Sanders\, Elizabeth Warren
 \, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\, Howard Stern\, Barbra Streisand\, Kerry Washingt
 on\, Michael Steele\, Megyn Kelly\, Ronan Farrow\, Howard Dean\, Michael M
 oore\, Eva Longoria\, Rev. Jesse Jackson\, Jim Carrey\, Gen. Wesley Clark\
 , Susan Sarandon\, Gary Hart and Pat Buchanan – Maher has written five b
 estsellers: “True Story\,” “Does Anybody Have a Problem with That? P
 olitically Incorrect’s Greatest Hits\,” “When You Ride Alone\, You R
 ide with Bin Laden\,” “New Rules: Polite\nMusings from a Timid Observe
 r\,” and\, “The New New Rules: A Funny Look at How Everybody But Me Ha
 s Their Head Up Their Ass.”\nMaher started his career as a stand-up come
 dian in 1979\, and still performs at least fifty dates a year in Las Vegas
  and in sold out theaters all across the country. Bill has also been recog
 nized with numerous Emmy nominations for his stand-up specials for HBO. He
 ’s done 11 solo specials for the premium cable channel including\, “Bi
 ll Maher: Be More Cynical” (2000)\, “I’m Swiss” (2005)\, “Bill M
 aher … But I’m Not Wrong” (2010)\, and his most recent\, “Bill Mah
 er: Live From Oklahoma“ (2018). His 12th HBO solo special\, “#Adulting
 ” aired in Spring 2022.\nMaher was born in New York City\, raised in Riv
 er Vale\, N.J. and went to Cornell University. He now resides in Los Angel
 es.\n
