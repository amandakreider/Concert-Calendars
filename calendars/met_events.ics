 l be honored for the rescheduled date. For any further ticket inquiries pl
 ease reach out to point of purchase.\nAll fans ages 5 and older must be 
 fully vaccinated against COVID-19 (at least two weeks after second dose) 
 – and provide proof of vaccination prior to entering the venue. Masks w
 ill be required at all times except when actively eating or drinking. For

 l further notice\, masks are required to worn at all times for attendees\,
  regardless of vaccination status\, except while actively eating or drinki
 ng.\nEntry requirements and venue protocols are subject to change.\nRingo 
 Starr announced details for a North American tour with his current All Sta
 rr Band featuring Steve Lukather\, Colin Hay\, Gregg Rolie\, Warren Ham\
 , Gregg Bissonette\, and Hamish Stuart.\nThis announcement comes on the he
 els of the release of Ringo’s 20th studio record\, What’s My Name. The
  title track is a rousing anthem written by a returning All Starr Band mem
 ber\, Colin Hay\, that turns a familiar chant from Ringo’s live shows in
 to a rousing rocker sure to be a future crowd-pleaser.\nThe record is the 
 latest in a series of heartfelt and homespun records that Starr has produc
 ed in his home studio and a distinguished\, ever-changing yet often repeat
 ing cast of musical characters and friends playing along with Ringo. Those
  friends include Paul McCartney\, Joe Walsh\, Edgar Winter\, Dave Stewart\
 , Benmont Tench\, Steve Lukather\, Nathan East\, Colin Hay\, Richard Page\
 , Warren Ham\, Windy Wagner\, Kari Kimmel and more.\nRingo also just relea
 sed Another Day In The Life\, the third in his series of books with Genesi
 s Publications\, that follows the sell-out success of Postcards From The B
 oys (2003) and Photograph (2013)\, and features previously unpublished col
 lection of his photographs\, captioned with his own thoughts and anecdotes
 .\nReflecting his love of music\, travel and nature\, Another Day In The L
 ife shows us the world as seen through Ringo’s eyes. From Los Angeles to
  Tokyo and everywhere in between\, many of Ringo’s observational images 
 celebrate the quirkiness of life. Other photographs are taken behind the s
 cenes during historic events\, such as Ringo’s acceptance of a Grammy Li
 fetime Achievement Award and his return to New York’s Plaza Hotel\, 50 y
 ears after The Beatles first visited the USA. Joined by Paul McCartney\, J
 oe Walsh and a host of All Starr friends\, in Another Day In The Life Ring
 o Starr shares personal moments from a legendary life in music\, and offer
 s a unique and inspiring look at the world around us. View the book at Rin
 goStarrBook.com.\nAnd this past Saturday\, November 2\, 2019 Mayor John Mi
 risch of Beverly Hills welcomed Sir Ringo Starr and Lady Starkey\, joined 
 by family and friends\, at the dedication of Starr’s “Peace & Love” 
 sculpture – which will now permanently reside at the Beverly Hills Garde
 n Park on Santa Monica and Canon. Standing eight feet tall and weighing ne
 arly 1\,500 pounds\, the polished stainless steel sculpture replicates the
  hand gesture Ringo adopted in 1969. “Peace & Love” is a message that 
 has become synonymous with Ringo’s name\, and he has dedicated his birth
 day\, July 7\, towards spreading that message – last year celebrating 
 “Peace & Love” events in nearly 30 countries around the world. Ringo h
 opes that this gift will be a lasting way to carry the message of Peace & 
 Love forward in a place he has called home for many years.\n
