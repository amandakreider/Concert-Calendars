DESCRIPTION:Making Time & R5 Present: CS + Kreme\nUlla\n\nInfo: https://r5
 productions.com/event/cs-kreme/\n\nDoors at 7pm\nShow starts at 8pm\n\n\nC
 S + Kreme\nCS + Kreme are Conrad Standish and Sam Karmel – two Australia
 ns who record slow\, hallucinatory experimental music. There was a meeting
  of minds at an intrepid friend’s day-party in Melbourne a few years bac
 k\, then after one alchemic studio jam – the rest was history. \nOver t
 he past few years\, CS + Kreme have released a string of disparate records
  on DIY labels which share their ethos: Total Stasis\, Wichelroede and 
 the Trilogy Tapes. The latter collaborations with Will Bankhead have been
  the most prolific\, his label becoming an unofficial home away from home 
 for the duo. Issuing EPs Cold Shoulder in 2018\, howwouldyoufeelwithoutth
 atthought\, as well as the Snoopy LP to critical acclaim in 2020.\nSnoo
 py is their most comprehensive body of work to date. It connected deeply 
 with people during the pandemic and polled high in various end of year lis
 ts with prominent electronic musical outlets such as Resident Advisor\, 
 XLR8R\, Crack Magazine and Boomkat who dubbed it: “An absolute trea
 sure of an album – a quietly seductive\, deeply romantic and stealthily 
 addictive long-player in the most classic\, enduring sense.” \nTranscen
 ding style and space\, CS + Kreme don’t follow a philosophy with making 
 music\, what they do is more fluid. Drawn like moths to the liminal state\
 , they write slow and meditative “horizontal-music” which takes in hea
 vy dub processing\, sweeping post-punk and chamber music soundscapes\, anc
 hored around Standish’s leftfield bass guitar. In Karmel’s words\, “
 Inherently\, there are influences that come through without us even realis
 ing. It’s kind of that cliche where people put their two cents forward f
 or what our influences are\, but I don’t think we’ve set out to be lik
 e anyone or anything.”\nBoth seasoned musicians\, Standish and Karmel to
 gether hold a rich history of collaborations in successful experimental gr
 oups such as: F ingers\, Bum Creek\, Standish/Carlyon and Devastations\, t
 o name a few. Most recently they have collaborated with composer James Rus
 hford who played portative organ on Snoopy and cellist Judith Hamann who
  contributed to “April Fools Day”\, off howwouldyoufeelwithoutthattho
 ught. \nIn early 2020 CS + Kreme travelled to the UK for their first over
 seas performances together at The White Hotel in Manchester and a Trilogy 
 Tapes showcase in London. They are currently writing the follow up to Sno
 opy and developing commissions for several European festivals\, including
  Rewire (NL) and Berliner Festspiel (DE).\nUlla\nUlla roots her style in i
 mprovised jazz and blues on a very welcome follow-up to her sublime ‘Tum
 bling Towards A Wall’ LP.\nUlla offers more precious room to breathe and
  space to think on ‘Limitless Frame’\, dispensing a broader palette of
  instrumentation to evoke finer\, ephemeral feels with a more timeless app
 eal. Her sound appears more porous to influence from strains of wistful ja
 zz and blues here\, vacillating and morphing her dreamlike ambient purview
  between parts of signature\, aleatoric ambient pads and rustling room rec
 ordings\, along with more classicist or traditionalist turns of guitars\, 
 sax and keys that call to mind K. Leimer via The Remote Viewer. It’s a p
 erhaps surprising change in the winds of her music\, and one we’re very 
 happy to follow.\nIn the artist’s own words “I made this music as a wa
 y to hug myself” and listeners can trust that hug will extend to them\, 
 too. She spends the first half of the record wrapping us up in clouds of p
 ads\, processed strums and fractured melodies\, whisked to a gentle peak i
 n the keening swoon of ‘Chest of Drawers’ around the middle\, while th
 e second half unravels into gorgeous loner arrangements. She captures the 
 most wistful sensations akin to Annie Hogan’s parlour keys on ‘Somethi
 ng Inside My Body’\, and crystalline trickles of guitars in ‘Clearly T
 he Memory’\, with the softly pealing wind of ‘Walk Alone’ calling to
  mind Loren Connors and Daniel Carter’s ‘The Departing of A Dream.’\
