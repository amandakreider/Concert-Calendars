 sh began in Logan Hammon’s bedroom when she was 13 years old\, writing s
 ongs on her dad’s old guitar and recording covers on garageband. In her 
 sophomore year of high school\, she found some friends in jazz band class 
 to help fulfill her dream of playing her songs in a full band. Together th
 e band began developing their indie rock sound by getting inspired by 90s 
 alternative and early 2000s indie. In 2019\, the band released their self-
 titled debut album on a local Bay Area label Asian Man Records\, and a sec
 ond full length “Penelope” in 2023. Since then the band has supported 
 artists like Hunny\, Mom Jeans and Jeff Rosenstock out on tour. Through it
  all\, the band has made the joy of playing music and having fun the most 
 important thing.\n\nSTRAWBERRY LAUNCH\nStrawberry Launch is a pop rock ban

 yboard and Benjy Berkowitz on drums. Their debut EP (released in August 20
 21) quickly gained praise from Under the Radar\, Rolling Stone India and A
 twood Magazine\, saying of the bands EP\, “Strawberry Launch cast a wide
  net\, embracing astral synths and guitar tones\, big pop harmonies and me
 lodies\, and cathartic chorus crescendos that amount to massive simultaneo
 us releases of emotion and music”. The group has built a devoted followi

 ductions.com/event/glitterer-2/the-first-unitarian-church/\n\nDoors at 7:3
 0pm\nShow starts at 8pm\n\n\nGLITTERER\nGlitterer is a band from Washingto
 n\, D.C. Initially\, and for some time\, it was a solo project: a man and 
 his laptop\, with occasional in-studio and onstage assistance from other h
 uman beings. Four records\, including two full-length albums on Anti-\, we
 re released in that one-guy period. But now Glitterer is a band: four char
 ter members writing and recording songs and performing them at shows toget
 her\, driving around the country\, getting on each other’s nerves. Road 
 cases piled in the van. Soundcheck at 5 p.m. Merch in the back. A band. Yo
 u’re familiar with bands? Glitterer is one of those. They play loud melo
 dic post-hardcore rock music that can sometimes seem simple but is always 
 subtly weird and complex. Their new 12-song LP\, Rationale\, will be out o
 n Anti- on Feb. 23\, 2024.\nNed Russin\, the singer and bassist\, the erst
 while one-guy\, started Glitterer in 2017\, about a year after his previou
 s band\, Title Fight\, stopped touring. He was in New York\, studying at C
 olumbia\, reading\, writing\, thinking\, paying exorbitant rent to live in
  a nice apartment in Bushwick\, and quietly panicking about the direction 
 of his life and the nature of existence. He would sit in his bedroom in th
 e nice apartment and write music using loops\, synths\, his bass\, and his
  voice. He recorded 18 songs — gnomic\, hooky ditties that gave oblique 
 expression to the quiet panic — and released them himself\, on two succe
 ssive EPs.\nThen he finished at Columbia\, struck out in whatever job mark
 et newly minted Ivy Leaguers compete in\, signed a record deal\, and start
 ed touring with the laptop. The debut full-length\, Looking Through The Sh
 ades\, came in 2019\, featuring live instruments and production help from 
 Alex G. Things were looking up. Then the world went to hell. In stupefied 
 isolation\, Russin and his studio collaborators made another full-length r
 ecord in the first pandemic year. It was called Life Is Not A Lesson and i
 t came out in early 2021 — not the most auspicious timing. But like its 
 predecessor\, the record made a mark\, eliciting raves in outlets like The
  A.V. Club\, Spin\, Stereogum and a little publication called the Washingt
 on Post\, in which critic Chris Richards (a D.C. post-hardcore musician hi
 mself\, most notably as a member of the Dischord band Q and Not U) describ
 ed Glitterer’s music as employing “melodic bursts so efficient\, they 
 almost feel absurd” and referring to one section of the song “Fire” 
 as “a staggering moment.”\nMaking Life Is Not A Lesson was lonely and 
 harrowing\, Russin says now\, but when it was done he continued writing ne
 w songs at his usual prolific rate. He had a day job by then (“my first 
 proper W-2 job\,” he says\, “at 30 years old\, after a decade playing 
 music”)\, but inevitably there would be another Glitterer record. More p
 ressingly\, now that the U.S. live-music scene was warily reconstituting i
 tself in the post-acute phase of COVID\, there would be shows.\nExecutive 
 decision: No more laptop. It was time to become a band. “I had a few dif
 ferent ideas of how to expand Glitterer\,” Russin says\, “but after sp
 ending a year practising songs about loneliness by myself\, I decided a co
 hesive band was the only way to go. It has been\, and always will be\, my 
 preference to be in a collaborative\, creative unit\, I just had to figure
  out how to get there.” \nAnd so in the late spring of 2021 he began re
 cruiting musicians from the D.C. and Baltimore punk/hardcore/indie scenes.
  As luck would have it\, his future keyboardist\, Nicole Dao\, was also hi
 s boss at the time. “Ned was working at my shop\, Donut Run\, when I hea
 rd he was looking to put together a full band for Glitterer\,” Dao says.
  “I mentioned that I knew how to play piano. Ned extended the offer to p
 ractice with him\, and I accepted.” Eventually\, a full lineup coalesced
 \, with Dao on keyboard\, Jonas Farah on drums\, and Connor Morin on guita
 r.\nFor more than a year\, this incarnation of Glitterer-the-band hit the 
 gig circuit — local one-offs\, regional weekends\, longer-run tours both
  domestic and foreign\, including a Spring 2023 run with Tigers Jaw and a 
 subsequent headlining summer tour that drew capacity crowds.\nAll along\, 
 the new songs kept coming. “In my post-COVID haze\, the earliest song I 
 wrote for Rationale (“It’s My Turn”) was about getting a job\,” Ru
 ssin says. “A lot of the subsequent songs continued in that territory\, 
 wondering about what I should be doing\, trying to figure out my ‘purpos
 e\,’ both philosophically and vocationally.” \nRussin handled the lyr
 ics\, but all four members worked on the music together\, a new and fruitf
 ul process. “Some songs we worked on as a group at practice\, and other 
 times we’d work out parts on our own\,” Dao says. “Once Ned\, Connor
  and Jonas basically laid out a song\, that’s when I like figuring out w
 here keys fit in. I worked with Ned on a lot of my parts\, and I really en
 joyed that\, since this was my first time ever writing music.”\nBy early
  2023 there was enough material for an album. In May\, the band took up re
 sidence for a week at a spacious Philadelphia Airbnb\, where the hot water
  worked about half the time\, and each morning they commuted to the studio
 . They recorded Rationale with in-demand producer Arthur Rizk (Ghostmane\,
  Code Orange\, Power Trip)\, who\, to date\, has either recorded\, produce
 d\, mixed\, mastered\, or done some combination of all four on every singl
 e Glitterer record.\nTo an extent even greater than with previous Glittere
 r releases\, Rationale is steeped in the many streams of indie rock and po
 st-punk/hardcore that course through the variegated musical landscape of g
 reater Washington\, D.C.\, the band’s homebase. Russin cites Lilys and U
 nrest as key influences on his recent song writing\, but the record also e
 vokes heady and formally adventurous local legends like Fugazi and Nation 
 of Ulysses\, as well as some of the more theatrical and conceptual ’70s 
 and ’80s British groups (e.g.\, Wire\, Siouxsie and The Banshees) that m
 ade early and lasting impressions on the D.C. scene.\nLead single “Plast
 ic” combines high-impact musical gestures — a capital-R riff a la The 
 Stooges in the James Williamson period\; a climactic keyboard lead that ev
 inces slyly self-deprecating melodrama — with an Ozymandias lyrical turn
 \, a reflection on the transience of earthly human deeds (“Anything / Th
 at’s everything / Ends up in landfills over time”). Such sic transit g
 loria resignation recurs frequently\, as on “The Same Ordinary\,” a wa
 ll of phasey 4ADish sound with lyrics about accepting\, like an old-time C
 alvinist\, a vocational calling\, the one thing you know you’re meant to
  do\, in all its objective banality and pointlessness (“Cause passion is
  arbitrary / It’s all the same ordinary”).\nAlso in keeping with D.C. 
 hardcore history — specifically\, its often unabashed intellectualism 
 — is Russin’s willingness to own up to literary influences. He gives 
 partial credit for the new album’s title\, Rationale\, to the author and
  publisher Martin Riker\, who in his most recent novel\, The Guest Lecture
 \, records the involuted\, anxious\, and epigrammatic thoughts that invade
  a struggling left-wing academic’s mind during an especially dark night 
 of the soul. “Ideology\,” the protagonist says to herself at one point
 \, is “all the assumptions you make about how to live\, and you live so 
 deeply inside these assumptions that it’s very difficult … to remember
  which parts of your reality are natural and inevitable\, versus which par
 ts are things people just made up.”\n“That quote and the book’s them
 es tied a lot into what I was thinking about while writing\,” Russin say
 s. “It’s about the need to find pleasure\, and maybe more so meaning o
 r purpose\, in small\, mundane things\, the modern anxieties and frustrati
 ons with just trying to be a human being. The lyrics touch on a lot of tho
 se ideas.”\nGlitterer needs no Rationale for being the band they are and
  making the music they make. But they’ve provided one\, nonetheless.\n\n
 DRAAG ME\nPhilly’s lord of the shithouse\, the project of Spirit of the
  Beehive’s Zack Schwartz and Corey Wichlin materialized during the pande
 mic. Both stuck at home\, the duo sent emails to each other with ideas for
  songs. And over the course of a year\, file sharing turned into fully rea
 lized tracks. Songs left on the cutting room floor of Spirit’s landmark 
 record ENTERTAINMENT\, DEATH\, got rejiggered\, made stranger\, and put in
 to the draag me universe along the way. But make no mistake — draag me i
 sn’t a Spirit of the Beehive side project\, it is a project that exists 
 in a swirl of its own.\n\nA COUNTRY WESTERN\nA Country Western is a Philad
 elphia rock band (Derek Hengemihle\, Garrett Miades\, Erik Hilbert and Par
 is Parker). Their newest album\, Life on the Lawn\, is out now on DIY labe
 l Crafted Sounds (based in Pittsburgh/DC) and showcases their evolution w
 ith a blend of louder guitars\, playful feedback\, and centered vocals\, i
 nterwoven with sparser moments that have long captivated their audience. T
 heir thematic exploration delves into pressing issues like environmental d
 estruction\, capitalism\, navigating a hyper-digital society\, self-realiz
 ation\, loss\, and even the enigmatic world of birds.\n

 Signals Midwest\, Town Liar\n\nInfo: https://r5productions.com/event/resto
 rations-3/the-first-unitarian-church/\n\nDoors at 7:30pm\nShow starts at 8
 pm\n\n\nRESTORATIONS\nIt’s been six long years since Restorations put 
 out an album and they’re ready to do it again. The self-titled Restorat
 ions will be self-released on March 22nd. Like their four previous full-l
 ength albums\, Restorations is a mirror held up to the band’s life. Bu
 t more than this\, it’s a reinvention of Restorations. Even as it tread
 s familiar ground—Restorations is and always will be a loud guitar band
 —Restorations crackles and vibrates with urgency and momentum. It feels
  like a machine whose pieces have all tightened into place\, finally churn
 ing at full\, furious speed. It’s the sound of five friends recommitting
  themselves to their band\, to each other\, and to the things that have al
 ways made sense: guitars\, keys\, bass\, drums\, and vocals crashing again
 st one another in thunderous\, beautiful release.\nJon Loudon (vocals/guit
 ars)\, Dave Klyman (guitars/vocals)\, Dan Zimmerman (bass/vocals)\, Bean F
 riend (keys/guitars)\, and Jeff Meyers (drums/percussion) began work on R
 estorations four years ago. With the band spread between Philly\, Ashevil
 le\, and Buffalo\, they scheduled time for long-form practice sessions at 
 Philadelphia’s Retro City Studios and Gradwell House Recording in New Je
 rsey. The sessions were intentional. With only so much time together\, the
  band began writing in a more purposeful and concentrated way\, and the ti
 me off between each provided the time to work and rework the arrangements.
 \nThere were no deadlines or tours or contractual obligations to fulfill. 
 When they were ready to hit record at Retro City—Klyman engineering—th
 e focus was exclusively on creating sounds that felt exciting and fun for 
 them alone. It was designed from the start to sound exactly like what it i
 s: five longtime friends in a room together\, reconnecting on a near molec
 ular level about what it means to make unbridled\, life-affirming noise. I
 t’s unsurprising to listen to the album and find what came of this appro
 ach: monumental choruses\, flurries of distorted guitars and soaring leads
 \, keyboard interludes\, the feel of a band striking gold in a frigid gara
 ge somewhere and grinning at one another. It’s a big\, dumb rock album. 
 (The title of midway track “Big\, Dumb” might just be a wink.)\nBut R
 estorations feels considered and careful even in its gleeful abandon. It 
 counts nine tracks of loud\, jubilant guitar music that feel immediate and
  intimate\, just like the sessions that produced them. Lead single “Cure
 d” is the first taste\, booting up with a squeal of feedback and hulking
 \, aggressive chords before Zimmerman’s grease-slicked bass and Meyers
 ’ drums take the reins. Then Loudon’s voice rips through the room: “
 God only answers to say ‘no\,’” he roars\, his raw belt as clear and
  powerful as it’s ever been. Effected guitar leads combust\, fall apart\
 , and steam back into view throughout\; all the while\, that enormous bass
  and those relentless drums pound forward. It’s vintage Restorations\, 
 calling up a feeling you can find across their work.\nThere are flickers o
 f chaos at the edges of most Restorations songs. Part of that comes from
  Loudon’s trademark man-on-the-brink tenor and his razor-sharp lyricism\
 ; other times\, like on the major-key madhouse “This Guy Does Not Rememb
 er You\,” it’s a team effort. But there are moments of spareness and r
 eflection\, too. The aforementioned “Big\, Dumb” opens with rippling\,
  sunny keys from Friend\, even as glitches and modulations lurk in the bac
 kground\; “800\,” too\, leans on Friend’s organ for richness and con
 trol. The outro of closer “Charm” shakes down the heavens under a choi
 r of interspersed vocals.\nThis album wasn’t easy to make. The members o
 f Restorations are getting older\, and their lives are changing. They’r
 e crossing the threshold of 40 as the band nears 16 years together\, and c
 reating this LP humbled them. It’s probably because of that fact\, and n
 ot in spite of it\, that they’ve produced their most thrilling and vital
  album to date. Restorations demonstrates the fullness that time\, care\
 , and camaraderie can bring to a creative endeavor. Put more plainly: maki
 ng music with your best friends is still good\, and always will be.\n\nSIG
 NALS MIDWEST\nGeography is important\, so here’s a rundown: Signals Midw
 est is an indie-rock-tinged punk band from Cleveland\, Ohio. Members curre
 ntly reside in Philadelphia\, Pittsburgh\, and Cleveland. Since forming in
  2008\, they have released five full-length albums and a slew of split 7
 ″s and EPs. Their latest full-length album “DENT” was recorded in Ba
 ltimore\, MD at Magpie Cage Recording Studio by venerated producer J. Robb
 ins (Against Me!\, The Promise Ring\, Jets to Brazil) and released on Los 
 Angeles’ Lauren Records in April of 2022.\n“Siggies”\, as one partic
 ularly eloquent fan dubbed the group somewhere along the line\, has extens
 ively toured North America\, Europe\, the UK\, and Australia. In 2023\, th
 ey supported legendary emo band Braid on their 25th anniversary “Frame a
 nd Canvas” U.S. tour and\, depending on when you read this\, they are ei
 ther about to go or just went to Japan for the first time.\nIf you can rem
 ember to take a breath to appreciate it\, playing in a rock band can be a 
 beautiful\, peculiar lens through which to view the world. As they approac
 h nearly two full decades of existence\, Signals Midwest is just grateful 
 to still be around and doing the damn thing.\n\nTOWN LIAR\nNew Jersey. Fea

 from Orlando Florida\; a quartet comprised of Sam Ray\, Kitty Ray\, Sean L
 aBree\, and Nathan Munizzi. Together they create music that is as enjoyabl
 e as it is unclassifiable\, eschewing the algorithmic nature of the modern
  music industry in favor of something more personal and much more interest
 ing. Broadly speaking\, they are as much a power-pop group as they are a s
 ludge-metal band\, with as much else in-between as that suggests. Though t
 hey draw influence from a bevy of different styles\, they aim to create so
 mething uniquely synergistic out of them\, rather than let them rot next t
 o each other as pastiche.\nWhile the band has existed in many phases – f
 irst as a solo project of Sam Ray\, then as a two piece with original drum
 mer Eric Livingston\, and later as a loose collective of likeminded musici
 ans & semi-permanent touring partners – the present lineup remains the f
 irst time there has been a dedicated and full-time group to write\, record
 \, and perform together. Innervated by this recent development\, the membe
 rs have remained hard at work writing and recording new music – their fi
 rst since 2021\, and the first ever that’s been created in such a collab
 orative manner – and are looking forward to debuting much of it on tour 
 in the spring & summer.\nIn addition to Teen Suicide\, the band members ar

 ces – beautiful synth-pop/psychedelic music under her own name\, as well

 ead Best’s music is equal parts melody and blazing aggression. It is a r
 aw expression of two punk veterans exhuming deep anxieties through pummeli
 ng guitars and frantic vocals Dead Best is a clear profile of Goren and So

 album from New Jersey group Well Wisher\, is a fiery burst of catchy\, fev
 erish punk rock that addresses the heaviness of personal trauma without be
 ing suffocated by its gravity. It is a confluence of the group’s uncente
 red rock influences including The Breeders and Built to Spill\, in additio
 n to songwriter Natalie Newbold’s somber acoustic favorites such as Elli
 ott Smith and Phoebe Brigders. As the record progresses\, the jumpy\, visc
 eral instrumentation emphasizes the tender introspections that Newbold’s
  writing weaves into these songs. The result is something both cathartic a
 nd therapeutic\; art that will make you want to thrash and jump around wit
 h tears of acceptance and future growth.\nOriginally started as a solo pro
 ject for NJ songwriter Natalie Newbold (current bassist in The Front Botto
 ms)\, Well Wisher has taken shape as a full band with Lucas Dalakian (form
 erly of Romp)\, Lynsey Vandenberg\, and Matt Viani. Since the band’s inc
 eption in 2018 they have shared the stage with notable acts like Mancheste
 r Orchestra\, The Front Bottoms\, New Found Glory\, Bayside\, Lucy Dacus\,
  Deerhunter\, Laura Stevenson and many\, many more. Well Wisher’s long-a
 waited sophomore record\, That Weight\, is out now via Egghunt Records!\n

 nShow starts at 8pm\n\n\nDOWNTOWN BOYS\nThe United States’ myriad inequa
 lities\, hatreds and phobias are painfully evident in 2017\, offering proo
 f that the age-old dichotomy of “political bands” versus “apolitical
  bands” simply doesn’t exist. Either you are comfortable and unfazed b
 y the current reigning power structures\, or you choose (or have no choice
  but) to use your music as a vehicle for the dismantling of oppression and
  the creation of something better. No matter what your songs are about\, y
 ou are choosing a side.\nThe position of Providence\, RI’s Downtown Boys
  has been clear since they started storming through basements and DIY spac
 es with their radically-minded\, indefatigable rock music: they are here t
 o topple the white-cis-het hegemony and draft a new history. In the words 
 of vocalist and lyricist Victoria Ruiz\, they are “five unique and indiv
 idual people who believe in the spectrum of people\, experiences and emoti
 ons.” On their self-titled 2014 EP on Sister Polygon Records (run by the
 ir like-minded friends in Priests)\, they offered songs like “Slumlord S
 al\,” which strikes out against abusive landlords. Its accompanying vide
 o relays the idea that cops can be literally smacked out of their oppressi
 ve mindsets and into an exuberantly queer dance party. This is how Downtow
 n Boys began\, combining revolutionary ideals with boundless energy and co
 ntagious\, inclusive fun\, and their resolve has only strengthened as both
  their sound and audience have grown.\nCost of Living is their third full-
 length\, following a self-released 2012 debut and 2015’s Full Communism 
 on Don Giovanni Records. They recorded it with Guy Picciotto\, one of indi
 e-rock’s most mythological figures\, in the producer’s chair. (Althoug
 h best known for his ability to sing while dangling from a basketball hoop
 \, he’s also produced pivotal albums by The Gossip and Blonde Redhead\, 
 among others.) “He very much enabled us to believe in what we were doing
  enough to get the record done\, and get it done well\,” says Joey La Ne
 ve DeFrancesco\, Downtown Boys’ guitarist\, vocalist and primary songwri
 ter. Picciotto fostered the band’s improvisational urges while also pull
 ing the root of their music to the forefront: unflinching choruses\, fearl
 essly confrontational vocals\, and the sense that each song will incite th
 e room into action\, sending bodies into motion that were previously thoug
 ht to have atrophied.\nDowntown Boys are keenly aware of the increased vis
 ibility and credibility that comes with signing to a corporate-media congl
 omerate such as Sub Pop. They’re using this platform as a megaphone for 
 their protest music\, amplifying and centering Chicana\, queer\, and Latin
 o voices in the far-too-whitewashed world of rock. Opener “A Wall” rid
 es the feel-good power that drove so many tunes by The Clash and Wire as i
 t calls out the idea that a wall could ever succeed in snuffing the humani
 ty and spirit of those it’s designed to crush. “Promissory Note” is 
 a bold self-introduction to the exclusive clubs that either ignore Downtow
 n Boys’ existence\, or possibly worse\, feign appreciation: “So what
 ’s the matter\, you don’t like what you see? I can’t believe you’r
 e even talking to me!” Ruiz shouts that she won’t light herself on fir
 e to keep you warm\, and\, like underground rock pioneer Alice Bag’s vit
 riolic verse\, it’s a claim you wouldn’t dare question. “Tonta\,” 
 one of the three songs written and sung primarily in Spanish\, is an intro
 spective and emotional portrait of anguish\, and it calls to mind the migh
 ty scrum of Huasipungo at an ABC No Rio matinee.\nCompared to previous eff
 orts\, Downtown Boys have shifted from a once-meaty brass section to the s
 ubtler melodic accompaniment of keyboards and a saxophone\, coloring their
  anthems with warm\, bright tones while Ruiz spits out her frustrations\, 
 passions\, and intents. Some might say it shows a sense of maturity\, as D
 owntown Boys have undoubtedly smoothed down some of their earlier edges\, 
 but there is no compromise to their righteous assault and captivating pres
 ence. Like the socially conscious groups of years past\, from Public Enemy
  to Rage Against the Machine\, Downtown Boys harness powerful sloganeering
 \, repetitive grooves\, and earworm hooks to create one of the most necess
 ary musical statements of the day. We should all do well to take notice!\n
 \nPAPER BEE\nPaper Bee is a Philly based rock band with choral elements an
 d deep basement roots. Soon after originally forming in New England in 201
 5\, Paper Beerecorded the split recordNow I Know You And See How Wide You 
 Are To The World with Loone. After a few years of small tours and local s
 hows\, the band took a several year hiatus when songwriter Nick Berger mov
 ed to Philadelphia.A new iteration of the band came together during early 
 pandemic times in 2020 to record their first full length album\,Thaw\, Fre
 eze\, Thaw. \nNick’s songwriting explores the soft centers and the shar
 p edges of loving relationships and overlapping traumas\, as well as quest
 ioning the nature of belonging\, both in space and within queer bodies. Di
 fficult to pin to one genre\, the songs onThaw\, Freeze\, Thaw incorporat
 e a range of sounds from gentle bedroomy synth to harsh sludgy distortion\
 , introspective finger-picking to cacophonous\, crescendoing loops\, blast
  beats\, off-kilter time signatures\, and many places in between. Threads 
 of repeating chord progressions\, rhythms\, riffs\, and lyrics run through
 out the album\, tying it all together in a circular arc that leads the lis
 tener through a story about where home exists\, internally and externally.
 \nWhile living together during quarantine\, bassist Sam Cook-Parrott\, dru
 mmer Anthony Richards\, and Nick on guitar and vocals\, dove into sculptin
 g and reworking the album as a much needed creative outlet during the chao
 s of that time. The dynamic instrumentation reflects the camaraderie and j
 oy of the experience\, learning to read one another to seamlessly flow thr
 ough the songs. Sam’s understated and emotive bass lines\, Tony’s driv
 ing yetrestrained drumming\, as well as vast and intricate vocal harmonie
 s from Cherise Nystrom\, Maryn Jones\, and Sam create a rich\, well rounde
 d\, and densely woven soundscape.\nThroughout 2021 and 2022 Paper Bee has 
 grown into an engaging and reliable local band in Philly. Without any rele
 ases showcasing the current line-up\, they’ve managed to perform regular
 ly\, building momentum for a much anticipated album. 2023 will see the rel
 ease of their full-lengthThaw\, Freeze\, Thawas well as touring and more s
 hows at home.\n

 riends\n\nInfo: https://r5productions.com/event/slothrust/the-first-unitar
 ian-church/\n\nDoors at 7:30pm\nShow starts at 8pm\n\n\nSLOTHRUST\nThere
 ’s cover songs\, and then there’s the many ways Leah Wellbaum and Will
  Gorin have flipped their favorite tracks over the past 15 years. Not just
  with their longtime band Slothrust either. The Sarah Lawrence grads first
  bonded over the blues\, a way to apply the progressive lesson plans of te
 achers like Mike Longo — a pianist who played with such jazz pioneers as
  Dizzy Gillespie and Lee Konitz — to fearless riffs and rhythms that fee
 l like total rewrites.\n Gorin is quick to credit Longo’s “Three I’
 s” lesson — imitation\, incubation\, and innovation — in particular.
  The main takeaway? That the best music comes from building upon other peo
 ple’s ideas\, rather than simply replicating or revisiting them.\n The 
 clearest example of this would be the Slothrust record Show Me How You Wan
 t It to Be\, a cover song compilation that dropped sand-blasted renditions
  of The Turtles (“Happy Together”) and Marcy’s Playground (“Sex an
 d Candy”) alongside spare takes on Al Green (“Let’s Stay Together”
 ) and Sam Cooke (“Cupid”).\nHeading even further out into left field i
 s the new EP I Promise\, a wild ride that includes a raw performance of 
 “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” and not one but four different recordings
  of the slo-mo smash “Pony.” The latter takes its cues from Ginuwine
 ’s cassingle\, which split its sides between a vibrant album version\, d
 rawn-out director’s cut\, Timbaland’s iconic beat\, and Ginuwine’s c
 arnal a cappella.\n Slothrust takes the track down two distinct paths bui
 lt around the original’s three powerhouse chords and effervescent low en
 d. One swings like a lithe slice of sludgy rock ‘n’ roll\, and the oth
 er dives straight off the deep end for 10 extra minutes\, playing to the p
 air’s strengths as well-rounded mind readers.\n“It’s always fun to l
 eave space in the music where improvisation is possible\,” explains Well
 baum\, “and that is part of what is so exciting to us about the extended
  version of ‘Pony’\; it’s entirely improvised\, and we only did one 
 performance of it in the studio.”\n“One of my all-time favorite quotes
  is from composer Claude Debussy\,” adds Gorin. “I first discovered it
  in Miles Davis’ biography\, when he said ‘music is the space between 
 the notes.’ I approach my playing with that kind of energy\, with an em
 phasis on filling negative space with symmetrical or asymmetrical patterns
 .”\nThe same can be said for the two snappy\, tightly wound tracks that 
 also landed on I Promise\, “Maybe Maybe” and “Magic Glow.” Written
  by Wellbaum while she was living in Florida last year and ending a “rea
 lly long and beautifully dramatic relationship\,” the songs are both poe
 tic and poppy\, working in hummable nods to liminal spaces\, ceremonial ma
 gic\, and eco-sexuality alongside a slick rhythm section (featuring Gorin 
 on drums and bass for the first time) and Welbaum’s manic guitar melodie
 s.  \n“The two originals on this EP are good examples of songs that wr
 ote themselves\,” says Wellbaum. “I decided that I wanted to do guitar
 -driven\, dynamic rock songs and I wrote these two as a pair\, which happe
 ns to me a lot.”\n Another recent example of songs that seemed to finis
 h each other’s sentences — sonically and lyrically — would be “Cou
 rtesy” and “Waiting” from Slothrust’s last record\, 2021’s Paral
 lel Timeline LP. All of this synchronicity makes perfect sense\, of course
 . After all\, Slothrust’s breakthrough album (Of Course You Do) is about
  to celebrate its tenth anniversary\, and the band’s core duo have conne
 cted on a kismet level ever since those early days.\n “Will and I have 
 been playing different genres of music in different configurations togethe
 r for almost 15 years now and that is a big part of our lock\,” says Wel
 lbaum. “We know how to work with each other in a variety of different se
 ttings and how to communicate outside of what we do specifically. That off
 ers us tremendous freedom.”\n “I feel like we have developed our own 
 unique sound to the point where we can ask ourselves ‘what would Slothru
 st do?’” adds` Gorin. “The paradox being that if Slothrust knew what
  Slothrust would do\, Slothrust would do the opposite.”\n\nWEAKENED FRIE
 NDS\nPortland\, Maine indie rock trio Weakened Friends dive into the hones
 t truth of being a working musician on their new LP\, Quitter\, reflecting
  on lost friendships and self-worth swallowed up by burnout. Songwriter\, 
 guitarist\, and vocalist Sonia Sturino is supported by Annie Hoffman (bass
 /vocals) and Adam Hand (drums)\, filling out a mature and emotive sound. 
 \nCentral to the record thematically is the empty threat of quitting music
  and “getting a real job”. Sturino wrestles with her relationship with
  music on the title track\, shouting “I love it\, but it never really fe
 els okay” over scorching guitars. Despite the implications of the title\
 , quitting is not an option for the band.  Even as friends settle into ad
 ulthood\, Weakened Friends find themselves trapped in a fortress of their 
 own creation\, inseparably attached to the eternal youthfulness of life in
  music. In this liminal zone\, life passes by and friendships are weakened
 \, and Quitter takes plenty of time to mourn these losses.\nChunky\, disto
 rted riffs support snarky\, cutting vocals on “Everything is Better”\,
  a tongue-in-cheek acceptance of one such broken friendship. Agile shifts 
 between heavy fuzz guitar and softer\, more introspective moments follow t
 he vocals through tumult and triumph as Sturino envisions what’s being s
 aid about her from the other side of the conflict. Leaning into a percepti
 on of her as cold and uncaring\, Sturino revels in the role of the villain
 \, taking jabs like “everything is better when you’re not around”. 
 \nThough the record acknowledges a perpetual state of arrested development
  that comes with being a musician\, the band is anything but stagnant musi
 cally.  Opening themselves up to ideas outside the constraints of their s
 lacker rock sound\, Weakened Friends puts the full force of their creative
  ambition into “Quitter”. Inspired by watching peers go above and beyo
 nd what is expected of them\, the band sought to explore each song’s ful
 lest potential\, with their most extensive pre-production and arrangement 
 work to date. Incorporating banjo\, pedal steel\, horns\, extensive synth 
 arrangement and a number of non-instrumental sounds such as ovens and came
 ra flashes\, Weakened Friends expand on their universe of sounds on their 
 new LP.\nSturino begins songs as skeletons\, allowing the rhythm section t
 o “pull every song apart and investigate every path they could go down
 ”\, as Hoffman put it. Focusing on the momentum behind every lyric\, the
  trio squeezes each musical moment for maximum emotional impact. The album
 ’s opener “Bargain Bin’ exemplifies this process\, beginning just wi
 th Sturino providing a contemplative melody underlaid by wandering guitar 
 picking. A sharp crack of the snare drops the rest of the band in\, cueing
  in a lush swell of bass and guitar. \nQuitter bears Sturino’s vulnerab
 ilities and insecurities about her role in the music world loudly and prou
 dly\, but in the confident and ambitious sounds that couch those fears\, W
 eakened Friends prove their worth as a vital and exciting rock band.\n

 \n\nOWEN\nSpanning more than two decades\, Mike Kinsella’s widely influe
 ntial songwriting has steadily sharpened and evolved with each new chapter
 . In his solo vehicle as Owen (in addition to his roles along the way with
  American Football\, Cap’n Jazz\, the more recent LIES\, and other colla
 borative ventures)\, Kinsella’s ability to seamlessly stitch jagged emot
 ional currents into crushingly beautiful songs has remained at the forefro
 nt of his art. This contrast has become more distinct as Owen expanded fro
 m unassuming acoustic beginnings into more ornate production\, reaching ne
 w levels of complexity and clarity by the release of 2020’s The Avalanch
 e. The Falls of Sioux\, Kinsella’s newest Owen full-length\, levels up e
 ven further. As much as these nine songs represent a type of reinvention\,
  they also feel like the natural next step in Kinsella’s growth\, both a
 rtistic and personal. The album perforates an established sound to explore
  unlikely musical ideas\, while the songs document a time of moving throug
 h life-altering turmoil into brighter days. Heavy themes are turned over w
 ith a gentle hand\, and Kinsella inhabits the deeper perspectives that com
 e with hard-earned life experience. \nThe Avalanche was an unbuffered expo
 sition of some of Kinsella’s darkest days\, laying bare the emotional fa
 llout of his divorce along with several other gradients of grief and loss.
  Those days aren’t forgotten\, but the pieces have been picked up on The
  Falls of Sioux. Solidly on the other side of a painful chasm\, moments of
  intensity now come across as confident and exploratory rather than tormen
 ted. The songs detail interpersonal situations that might have instilled p
 anic and self-loathing in younger days\, but now Kinsella meets them with 
 a relaxed smirk. It’s there in the way gliding synths and warm vocal har
 monies juxtapose brutal lyrics of doomed love on “Virtue Misspent\,” o
 ne of the album’s most upbeat songs. It’s also there in the jaunty\, n
 early classic-rock bounce of “Mount Cleverest\,” a lively banger that 
 feels like the highpoint of a sunny summer day but boils down to exhausted
 \, “fuck all y’all” sentiments. \nAs with the past few Owen albums\,
  Kinsella worked with co-producers Sean Carey (Bon Iver) and Zach Hanson (
 Bon Iver\, Low\, Waxahatchee) and also brought in Now\, Now’s KC Dalager
  to contribute backing vocals. Russell Durham (Fleet Foxes\, Andrew Bird) 
 composed the string arrangements\, Corey Bracken (from American Football
 ’s touring band) played synths\, and a few other friends stopped through
  to add upright bass\, pedal steel\, and various auxiliary contributions. 
 Kinsella’s sound palette was influenced heavily by his recent work with 
 his cousin Nate in their boundary-pushing group LIES. Experimenting with t
 he limits of electronic production inspired Kinsella to lean into sounds h
 e hadn’t considered before when writing for Owen. The acoustic guitar st
 rums of “Beaucoup” are slowly washed up against by a bedding of shoega
 ze texture\, a deep synth bass sequence\, and waves of noisy electronics. 
 “Hit and Run” is steady and restrained chamber pop\, speckled with gor
 geous strings and distant piano\, while the Western-noir vibes of opener 
 “A Reckoning” are emphasized by tubular bells so dramatic Kineslla had
  to fight with his producers to keep them on the song. The aim was to embr
 ace the excitement of the unknown rather than make safe\, surefire choices
 . \nThe open-ness of the music offers even Kinsella’s weariest lyrics an
  almost playful counterweighting\, giving The Falls of Sioux a new positio
 ning that hasn’t quite appeared before now in the Owen discography. It
 ’s like watching a difficult winter melt into a nicer-than-expected spri
 ng\, with the kind of distance from bad times that makes them easier to la
 ugh at in retrospect. More than anything\, the album is marked by a sense 
 of self-acceptance that can be felt regardless of how cutting the one-line
 rs or how melancholy the songs. Kinsella seems comfortable with himself an
 d his craft in a way that only happens when artists round a certain corner
  on their creative path. On The Falls of Sioux\, he’s unafraid to share 
 any and all angles by which he might be viewed. To some extent\, this has 
 always been Kinsella’s M.O.\, but it’s different when the songs stop b
 eing about the hungover guilt and communication breakdowns of early adulth
 ood and move into the very real disappointments and discontinuations that 
 inevitably surface as life keeps happening. Never one to retreat\, Kinsell
 a portrays the confusion\, regret\, and renewal of where he’s at present
 ly with grace\, honesty\, and of course some biting humor. Throughout The 
 Falls of Sioux\, the things about Owen that have changed become just as va
 luable as those that have remained the same. \n

DESCRIPTION:Chastity Belt\nCharlotte Cornfield\n\nInfo: https://r5producti
 ons.com/event/chastity-belt/the-first-unitarian-church/\n\nDoors at 7:30pm
 \nShow starts at 8pm\n\n\nCHASTITY BELT\nLive Laugh Love. \nIt’s a phra
 se you might encounter in a certain type of cursive on the wall of a certa
 in type of home. On the opposite end of the mood board\, it’s also a sti
 ck-and-poke tattoo on Chastity Belt guitarist/vocalist Julia Shapiro’s l
 eft ankle (just below a highly improvised Shrek)\, and the title of the ba
 nd’s fifth album. It’s fun\, it’s funny\, but it’s also sincere\, 
 not unlike the band’s history—a joke that became real because it was a
 lways real—and the enduring bond that has been their band’s foundation
  for the past 13 years.  \nIn their decade-plus together\, the four-piec
 e—Shapiro (she/her)\, Lydia Lund (guitar\, vocals – she/her)\, Gretche
 n Grimm (drums\, vocals – she/her)\, and Annie Truscott (bass\, vocals 
 – they/them)—have created a resonant body of work. The early days of 
 “Nip Slip” and “Pussy Weed Beer” (hits from their iconic debut ful
 l-length No Regerts\, which recently celebrated 10 years) and the “Cool 
 Slut” era of 2015’s Time To Go Home were raucous bonanzas of dry wit a
 nd self-evident feminism. A newfound gravity on 2017’s I Used to Spend S
 o Much Time Alone shifted the lyrical mood toward introspection as they co
 ntinued to refine their trademark sound: lush intertwining guitars\, metic
 ulous rhythms\, a careful balance of melancholy and optimism. Two years la
 ter\, the dreamy Chastity Belt marked a renewal of vows to their musicians
 hip and friendship\, each member coming into their own as artists\, conven
 ing with a fresh perspective on collaboration. \nLive Laugh Love is a nat
 ural continuation. Against the bizarre backdrop of the past few years\, Ch
 astity Belt remained a supportive space for the members to grow and experi
 ment\, drawing on the ingredients most essential to their process since th
 e beginning: authenticity and levity. Recorded over three sessions in as m
 any years (January 2020\, November 2021 and 2022)\, the focus became more 
 about enjoying their time together in the studio than making it feel like 
 work. Their ease and familiarity with engineer Samur Khouja in LA\, who al
 so recorded their last album\, made for a particularly enjoyable process\,
  even using extra time to work out a couple joke songs to entertain only t
 hemselves (fingers crossed we hear their medieval jig\, “Shilling for th
 e Shire\,” on a bonus edition someday). Once completed\, they returned t
 o renowned engineer Heba Kadry (Bjork\, Slowdive) who mastered the album.\
 nAlbum opener “Hollow” sets the tone with a gently driving rhythm whil
 e guitar layers stream like sun rays through an open car window. A warmth 
 radiates through Shapiro’s voice\, even while grappling with feeling los
 t and stuck. “The older I get\,” Shapiro says of the lyrics\, “the m
 ore I realize that I might just always feel this way\, and it’s more abo
 ut sitting with the feeling and accepting it\, rather than trying to fight
  it.” That wisdom seems to anchor Live Laugh Love. Chastity Belt has nev
 er shied from navigating the spectrum of difficult emotions\, and an exist
 ential thread weaves throughout the subject matter. And yet the songs feel
  more grounded than ever\; there’s a sense of quiet confidence and self-
 assurance that comes with being less numb and more present. Facing discomf
 ort takes more fortitude\, after all. \nLive Laugh Love finds the members
  in their prime as musicians. Their parts trace intricate patterns over on
 e another\, but there’s room to breathe between the layers. Everyone con
 tributes to the writing\, sometimes switching instruments\, and for the fi
 rst time\, all four members sing a song. It’s never been more apparent t
 hat they are creative siblings\, cut from the same belt. “We’ve been p
 laying music with each other for over a decade\,” says Shapiro\, “so i
 t really does feel like we’re all fluent in the same language\, and a lo
 t of it just happens naturally.” \n“Laugh” seeks in the balm of fri
 endship\, aware of the anticipatory nostalgia that hits during a good time
  that you’re already missing before it’s gone\; the heavier guitar ton
 es on “Chemtrails” streak ominous chord progressions over Grimm’s pr
 ecision timekeeping\, lamenting memories that won’t fade easily. During 
 a transitional time\, Truscott came across a note in their phone that read
 \, “it’s not hard all day\, just sometimes\,” which inspired a poign
 ant line in the chorus of “Kool-Aid\,” their first song as lead vocali
 st on a Chastity Belt recording. Another standout\, “I-90 Bridge” shin
 es with a silvery melody that soars as Lund belts one of the most resoundi
 ng moments on the album: “Tell your girlfriend she’s got nothing to fe
 ar/I’m set in my head/My body’s a different story.” The track “Blu
 e” saunters nonchalantly with a wink\; you can almost hear Shapiro’s s
 mile as she sings “Faking it big time/So I can hit my stride/Man\, it fe
 els good to be alive\,” channeling early Chastity Belt channeling early 
 ’90s before channeling the late Elliott Smith in a spiral of distortion 
 and insight: “Don’t get upset about it/It’s gonna pass/Tell all your
  friends about it/They’re gonna laugh.” \n“We have such a strong se
 nse of each other’s musical inclinations” says Lund. “I think this a
 llows for a lot of playfulness…we can kinda surprise each other\, like a
  good punchline would.”\nLiving\, laughing\, loving… maybe it really i
 s that simple.\n\nCHARLOTTE CORNFIELD\nIt’s been less than two years sin
 ce Highs in the Minuses became Charlotte Cornfield’s break-out—a magne
 tic mission-statement for the Toronto songwriter described by Rolling Ston
 e as “Canada’s best-kept secret.” Cornfield emerged from pandemic se
 clusion with new fans\, raised expectations\, and her first major US tour.
  She could have kept touring forever\; she could have fled to the woods wi
 th a four-track. She could have done anything. What she did was jump into 
 an old Subaru\, driving seven hours south to the Hudson Valley. The car di
 dn’t have any A/C\; she had only recently earned her license\; and she h
 ad never met the producer she was driving down to meet. But when Cornfield
  arrived in Hurley\, NY\, at the red-steepled church that is now Dreamland
  Recording Studios\, she was ready for whatever came next. “There was th
 is letting go of some of the strongheaded-ness that I think I used to have
 \,” she says\, “and an embracing of the open-endedness of life.”\nCo
 rnfield had come to Hurley to work with producer Josh Kaufman\, thrilled b
 y his sublime recordings with Cassandra Jenkins\, Anais Mitchell and his o
 wn band\, Bonny Light Horseman. The album they’d now make together\, Cou
 ld Have Done Anything\, is a testament to Cornfield’s uncommon life and 
 all its possibilities\, an acknowledgment that the best musicians can turn
  fleeting moments into timeless songs. Over nine magnetic tracks\, the sin
 ger-songwriter begins yet another chapter: gazing in the rear-view to unde
 rstand where she’s been\; squinting through the sunset to see what’s a
 head. Calmer than I was\, she sings in the album’s final moments. Strong
 er than I was / older than I was / less angry than I was…—and finally
 —happier than I was / happier than I was / happier than I was…\nWherea
 s Cornfield’s preceding albums were made in familiar settings\, with tro
 upes of friends\, her latest long-player reaches into the unknown. Kaufman
  and Cornfield (who went to school for jazz drums) played every instrument
  themselves\, from ringing guitars to cozy piano\, Hammond B3\, pedal stee
 l and synthesizers. Together with engineer D. James Goodwin (Kevin Morby\,
  Whitney) and assistant engineer Gillian Pelkonen\, the pair worked swiftl
 y\, impulsively\, trying to shrink the gap between having an idea and putt
 ing it on tape. The resulting sound is at once elaborate and unrehearsed\;
  there’s a sense that it’s coming together—and coming alive—at the
  very moment it’s being made.\n“The hours flew by\,” Cornfield says.
  “We lived inside of the songs there\, for a few days.” You can hear i
 t on a tune like “Cut and Dry\,” where a radiant\, easygoing groove fo
 rms the landscape of a song about seeing people as a whole\, together with
  their mistakes. There’s a similar throughline to “In From The Rain\,
 ” where rambling 70s licks and Cornfield’s tambourine flutter trace th
 e evolution of a friendship\, from intimacy to disappointment to acceptanc
 e. On the latter\, listen at the end of the first minute\, after Cornfield
  sings a lyric about rainstorms and visitors: Suddenly you were there\, go
 es the line—as a real-life thunderclap unfurls\, like an angel’s drumr
 oll. “All the mics picked it up\,” she recalls. “So we left it in.
 ”\n“Gentle Like the Drugs” draws on imagery from a spring tour in th
 e American west. “I was experiencing joy on the road in a way I really h
 adn’t before\,” Cornfield says\, and you can hear it in the patient pl
 easure of these chords\, or the way she narrates her first impressions of 
 Arizona: I watch the colours get real / the pink and the teal / I see a du
 st devil / I see an elevator. Like riding across the desert with your frie
 nds\; like smoking a joint at the end of a long day\; but the song’s alt
 ernating verses orient themselves towards another sensation\, too: that fe
 eling of being home\, and happy\, when your lover’s not around. Not beca
 use they’re gone\, but because you know they will return.\nIntimacy and 
 absence go hand-in-hand on Could Have Done Anything: the theme repeats on 
 the unfussy love-song “You and Me\,” with its tale of tour and homecom
 ing. You’re sunkissed in your Subaru / Picking me up at Terminal 3\, she
  sings—and\, later\, two bikes on a pavement path / ice cream cones and 
 epitaphs. Some love is as simple as this: liberating\, easy\, like piano a
 nd guitar in two-step. “I’ve been trying to write a song like this for
  a long time\,” Cornfield says. “A catchy love-song\, with cars. Where
  it feels like the narrator could go anywhere and do anything.\nThat was t
 he spirit of this record: connection\, possibility\, acceptance. “Don’
 t be afraid to take a left\,” Kaufman would say\, encouraging Cornfield 
 to drop preconceptions\, invent new rules. Even with the small things\, li
 ke wandering around the tracking room with a pair of claves in your hands\
 , or adding random\, surround-sound echoes to “The Magnetic Fields”—
 a song about a potent and formative live concert experience. Throughout\, 
 Cornfield tried to channel the energy of her favorite classic records\, fr
 om Tapestry to Blood On The Tracks to Car Wheels On A Gravel Road—albums
  where the listener is simply carried by the songs and the playing.\nAfter
  six days\, Cornfield went back to Canada\, with a new album to mix and ma
 ster. Another day-long drive\; another homecoming\; and one more thing\, t
 oo\, which would arise a little over nine months later: the singer’s fir
 st baby’s due April 2023. Anything can happen.\n

DESCRIPTION:Orchid\nNØ MAN\, Disappearances\, Grey C.E.L.L.\n\nInfo: http
 s://r5productions.com/event/orchid/the-first-unitarian-church/\n\nDoors at
  7:30pm\nShow starts at 8pm\n\n\nORCHID\nIt’s a little known bit of punk
  lore that when Bruce Springsteen wrote “everything that dies someday co
 mes back\,” he was specifically referring to the reunion of the New Engl
 and band Orchid. Maybe the Boss was a prophet\, maybe I’m lying\, or may
 be Orchid’s obsessions (black jeans rather than blue\, roller rinks\, mi
 xtape nostalgia\, a finely tuned localized pain) were more universal than 
 their niche adoration implies. Maybe—if young lads acting out\, made old
  by a cruel\, cruel world\, is a recurring feature—New Jersey predicts V
 alhalla.\nIf this reads cute\, fine. Orchid was always half overreach (amb
 ition to transcend whatever you got\, a refusal to settle for mere hardcor
 e striving)\, with an irresolvable tension between staunch/arch integrity 
 and proto electroclash horniness. The other half of Orchid was an infinite
 ly propulsive monument to chaos. Whether one prefers one half to the other
  probably depends on the notches on one’s library card. But the band\, i
 n their totality\, was pure explosion.\nThe band’s story began with Jays
 on Green\, Will Killingsworth\, and Brad Wallace at Hampshire College\, a 
 small school where students with signifying t-shirts might find each other
  (in Jayson’s recollection\, Will was wearing “probably something cool
  like His Hero Is Gone” and Jayson was wearing “some Connecticut hardc
 ore like\, I dunno\, Fastbreak. Probably Hatebreed…”). After completin
 g the then common hetronormative bonding ritual of trading mixtapes\, Will
  eventually suggested they start a band. Stars so aligned\, what followed 
 was an American story so well tread as to verge into archetypal: Jeff Sala
 ne was recruited\, the band recorded a demo\, played a show at the legenda
 ry Hampshire College Tavern\, and got asked to do a split with Pig Destroy
 er. In the biopic\, Scott Hull is played by Tom Hanks.\nRegarding “screa
 mo\,” “emo-violence\,” or any genre designation and the band’s pla
 ce within it\, that particular blood on Orchid’s hands is complexified. 
 While memory may place the band as part of the San Diego/Pacific NorthWest
  tradition of white belts and tight pants\, the truth is that “Salane\, 
 our drummer\, was like an indie kind of guy. He sang and played guitar as 
 well as he played drums (which is very good)\, while Will and Brad came fr
 om a crust grind background. Garlock is like a classic hardcore background
  guy\, you know?” Jayson says\, comparing the band aesthetics to old pho
 tos of Black Flag\, where it was like “how do these people even know eac
 h other?”\nSonically\, the band was unabashed in their attempting to wor
 th within a then nascent tradition of heavy\, shambolic\, abruptly gorgeou
 s hardcore-adjacent cacophony who captured the aggression of punk\, while 
 shying away (in their playing if not their record / t-shirt collections) f
 rom the bully-barking which made up so much of the genre. Of course\, as t
 he KLF recommends\, in attempting to sound like their social betters\, Orc
 hid made something—jaggedly melodic leads and self-lacerating\, witty pr
 eachifying over blast beats—entirely their own.\nWhile they existed\, Or
 chid took on the scene—past\, present\, and future—with reverence\, co
 ntempt\, and joy. That was Orchid’s approach\; taking the dead horse of 
 hardcore and breathing life into it by poking it\, prodding it\, loving up
  on it\, scrawling situationist slogans on its corpse like they were itchy
  runes\, till the dead horse had no choice but to get up and gallop around
  the all-ages venue.\nAfter Orchid broke up\, the individual members kept 
 their boots on the ground in other projects. Instead of the years creating
  an insurmountable distance\, the band remained close friends. With two de
 cades of reunion disavowals slightly undermined by that absence of schism.
 \nWhen asked to rate the improbability of Orchid’s reunion\, on a scale 
 of 1-10 Fugazis\, Green rejects the metric\, seeing Orchid’s reuniting a
 s somewhat less “world imploding” than Fugazi getting back together\, 
 while making clear that upcoming touring was made possible by the band mem
 bers’ common bond.\n“We’ve been offered stuff forever. Everyone’s 
 got their own stuff going on and it never appealed\,” Jayson says. “Fi
 nally\, I remember talking to Damien Abraham from Fucked Up and he said\, 
 ‘You like the guys?’ And I was ‘Yeah.’ Then he’s like\, ‘Do yo
 u like the songs?’ And I was like\, ‘Yeah.’ And he goes. ‘So what
 ’s the problem?\; And I was like\, ‘Huh. That’s a good point.’”\
 n“Then Brad said\, ‘you know\, I’m kind of ambivalent about reunitin
 g… But I think\, when we’re on our deathbeds\, we’re not going to be
  like\, I’m sure glad we didn’t reunite Orchid!’”\nThat was also a
  good point.\nSure\, nostalgia is a corpse to be danced on\, but now\, wit
 h passion being passe still being up for debate\, Orchid’s brand of slog
 aneering—revolutionary love backed by force and caustic rhythms—is a w
 elcome addition to the hell-discourse. Either way\, the band—dastardly a
 nti-fash futurists and anti-trad traditionalists that they gleefully and p
 aradoxically are—have returned…ready to revel in the confusion.\n\nNØ
  MAN\n“Will you die with your eyes open?”\nWashington D.C.’s NØ MAN
  is a necessary and much-needed voice in modern hardcore. Formed in 2017\,
  the four-piece punk band has been alchemizing the personal and the politi
 cal from the jump. Composed of members from Majority Rule\, the band’s c
 urrent aims go hand-in-hand with their past\, sonically and thematically.\
 nTheir upcoming album Glitter and Spit is the band’s third full-length L
 P\, solidifying their furious hardcore into a weapon of a record. Album op
 ener “Eat My Twin” twists and refracts a mid-tempo riff into a sonic h
 ammer\, cracking open the record’s heaviness to come. Singer Maha Shami 
 has fully come into her own as a frontperson\, snarling out the most vicio
 us vocals of her career on “Poison Darts.”\nAs the daughter of refugee
 s\, returning home to Palestine included witnessing first-hand the casual 
 atrocities inflicted on her family. Though written before the current conf
 lict’s boiling point\, Glitter and Spit synthesizes the 70+ years of sys
 temic violence carried out against Palestine and her own lived experiences
 . From school teachers and classmates telling her Palestine doesn’t exis
 t\, to being humiliated by soldiers at checkpoints when she visited her fa
 mily\, these many moments fuel the album’s lifeblood\, coalescing on 
 “Can’t Kill Us All.”\n“They want to silence us\,” Shami said at 
 a recent benefit show in D.C. “We will be louder. We aren’t fucking go
 ing anywhere. Because Palestine will never die.” Glitter and Spit is a m
 uch-needed fire of an album\, fueled by the anxieties and anger of the now
 \, erupting in a cathartic inferno.\nThe band’s members Matt Michel (gui
 tar/vocals)\, Pat Broderick (drums) and Kevin Lamiell (Bass) helped lay th
 e foundation for hardcore and screamo in Majority Rule from 1996 to 2004. 
 Alongside the band\, vocalist Maha Shami has been a longtime friend\, givi
 ng a “cameo” guest vocal performance on Majority Rule’s “Packaged 
 Poison” in 2004. When Majority Rule reunited in 2017 to perform multiple
  benefit shows\, it ignited a desire to keep creating\, and no one was bet
 ter equipped to step in as front person than Shami.\nTheir energy and spir
 it have brought them together on tour with bands like Portrayal of Guilt\,
  Darkest Hour\, FAIM\, Entry and more. In 2023 they collaborated with form
 er tourmates and fellow iconoclasts The HIRS Collective on the song “Swe
 et Like Candy.” They’ve also contributed to Secret Voice’s (the labe
 l of Touche Amore frontman Jeremy Bolm) compilation Balladeers\, Redefined

  Sheer Mag\n\n\nInfo: https://r5productions.com/event/sheer-mag/the-first-
 unitarian-church/\n\nDoors at 7:30pm\nShow starts at 8pm\n\n\nSHEER MAG\nS
 heer Mag have labored to carve out a discernibly singular position within
  the canon of contemporary rock: toggling with ease between the refined fl
 ourishes of a “connoisseur’s band” and the ecstatic colloquialism of
  populist songwriting—yet displaying no strict loyalty to either camp—
 their sound\, while oft-referenced\, is unmistakably and immediately recog
 nizable as theirs alone. On Playing Favorites\, Sheer Mag’s third full-
 length and first with Third Man Records\, the band capitalize on a decade
 ’s worth of devotion to their own collective spirit—a spirit refined i
 n both the sweaty trenches of punk warehouses and the larger-than-life gla
 mour of concert halls—emerging with a dense work of gripping emotions\, 
 massive hooks\, and masterfully constructed power-pop anthems. This is the
  record the Philadelphian rock and roll four-piece has always been destine
 d to make.\nPlaying Favorites expands with a sense of undeniable vitality
 \, buoyed by rock and roll’s singular capacity to channel a relentless c
 ompassion for human life. While at times marked by an intensified sense of
  melancholy\, this newest offering takes stock of the confusing flow of da
 ily life without moralizing\, refusing to fall into antagonistic cynicism.
  Sheer Mag leans into the chaotic thrall of city living\, of a life subdiv
 ided by the jagged highs and lows of bars\, parties\, and nightlife cultur
 e\, with sweetly empathetic remove. \nIts title track and album opener an
 nounces itself with a sense of self-assured swagger\, spinning a jubilant 
 tale of life on the road: the band is back together\, and they know they
 ’ve never sounded quite this good before. “After nearly ten years of t
 ouring together\, we felt qualified to write a song about doing it. It’s
  a good introduction to the next era of Sheer Mag\,” the band tell.\nPl
 aying Favorites burns with a sweetened gratitude for the lot one has been
  given in life: the luck of coming up punk\; the luck of living an unalien
 ated life\; the luck of feeling love\, and losing love. Sheer Mag began to
  work in earnest on their follow up to 2019’s A Distant Call in the su
 mmer of 2021\, which they originally imagined would take the shape of a ta
 utly constructed 4-song disco EP. As Matt Palmer\, the band’s rhythm gu
 itarist and primary lyricist\, recollects: “those first four songs came
  out of a hard moment in life for all of us collectively—they kind of fe
 lt like an attempt to figure out how to have fun when you actually feel mi
 serable.” Before long\, the band realized this new material would perha
 ps be better served within the context of a fully fleshed out rock LP\, br
 acketed by the support of a wider array of juxtaposing psychic moods and s
 onic textures. \nOver a six-month stretch spanning the fall of 2022 to th
 e winter of 2023\, guitarist Kyle Seely and his brother Hart Seely (ba
 ss) set about tracking the instrumentals for the record\, resetting their 
 studio configuration each week in order to impose a more tailored\, multi-
 session atmosphere upon the record’s acoustic landscape. Palmer rejoined
  vocalist Tina Halladay in Philadelphia the following spring to write an
 d record the vocals for Playing Favorites\, which depart rather markedly 
 from the band’s prior material\, placing an added emphasis on pronounced
 ly existential\, interpersonal storytelling and ornate background harmonie
 s. Reflecting upon the shift between this newest LP and the band’s previ
 ous material\, Halladay notes: “those first few records felt like a per
 sonal coming out party\; they felt like they were an introduction to me an
 d my life story. With these new songs\, I feel like I’m finally able to 
 move past that—there are parts on this record that I couldn’t imagine 
 being able to sing ten\, five\, or even three years ago.”\nSheer Mag hav
 e broken significant musical ground with Playing Favorites\, elevating th
 eir signature approach to rock and roll to lushly cinematic new heights. I
 ts filmic qualities reach their peak on “Mechanical Garden\,” which l
 urches forth like a three-part fugue\, carrying the listener from ripping 
 glam theatrics into a subtly psychedelic\, string and drum machine dub int
 erlude\, finally resolving upon perhaps the most openly depressive iterati
 on of Sheer Mag’s take on disco-inflected pop\, outfitted with a guest g
 uitar solo by Mdou Moctar. The baroque elegance of such moments find thei
 r natural counterpoint in the record’s more straightforward power-pop tr
 acks. Its greatest achievement\, however\, is perhaps its unabashed embrac
 e of nakedly emotional\, arena-sized choruses\, which seem to fizz out of 
 some sort of timeless radio set to the frequency of pure human experience.
  As Halladay puts it\, “Nobody seems to write straight up rock bangers 
 anymore–more than anything else\, we want this record to put huge\, catc
 hy songwriting front and center.”\nPlaying Favorites is undoubtedly a r
 ecord by the same Sheer Mag that audiences of all stripes have spent the l
 ast decade falling in love with. In fact\, for all of its sonic departures
  and evolutions\, this record is perhaps the most “Sheer Mag” releas
 e yet. Not so much a return to form\, but rather a realization of those gr
 eatest promises that the band has up until now only hinted at. With Playi
 ng Favorites\, Sheer Mag cater to their tastes and their tastes alone: so 
 long as they continue to do so\, the future of rock and roll\, that great 
 human tradition\, is in the best of hands.\n

 of the underground as a reclusive project for years\, sought out only by t
 he most masochistic and rabid fans of noise rock and industrial noise. The
 ir live performances have been described as a hopelessly bleak cacophony a
 nd the closest anyone today can get to seeing the oppressive force that wa
 s Swans in their 1980s prime. In 2023\, they performed 4 shows with the le
 gendary Swedish noise rock unit\, Brainbombs — 2 in NYC and 2 in Oslo\, 
 Norway. In Oslo\, the revolving door lineup of Bloated Subhumans included 
 Jonas Tiljiander of Brainbombs for both shows\, cementing an international
  noise alliance. Now\, for the first and possibly only time on US soil\, B
 loated Subhumans will be performing with a similar lineup. This isn’t a 
 tour\, it’s a single night of deranged\, sonic torture. And Philadelphia
  is the only city just unlucky enough to be caught in the maelstrom. If yo
 u’ve ever wanted to hear the sounds of your nightmares brought to life\,
  this is not to be missed.\n\nEYE FLYS\nEye Flys are a quintessentially P
 hiladelphian band whose aggressive brand of noise rock is leading a wave o
 f bands that harken back to classic era AmRep noise rock. Their rage is pa
 lpable and their wit is biting. Hailing from a city with a rich history of
  labor activism\, long associated with the hard-working\, the underdog\, t
 he everyman. The trio’s rounded nature\, one of whom is an active trade 
 union member\, imbues their music with a distinctive fearlessness and hone
 sty. Their acerbic wit swiftly whittles matters down to their element\, of
 ten reveling in the perverse humor of our current state of being. Eye Flys
  are unsparingly heavy\, driven by the colossal rhythm section of bassist
  Kevin Bernsten and drummer Patrick Forrest. Vocalist/guitarist Jake S
 mith delivers sharp humor with a healthy dose of venom and bile with each
  bestial growl while his dirty riffs roar at you. Recorded by Bernsten a
 t his own Developing Nations studio (Full of Hell\, Integrity\, Jarhead F
 ertilizer) and J Robbins’ The Magpie Cage\, the band’s self-titled 
 album features artwork drawn by artist and drummer John Herndon (Tortoise
 )\, known for his singular drawings and his band’s iconic TNT cover. 
 Eye Flys wades deeper into the muck and mire of modern living to take an 
 unflinching look at the horrors of late-stage capitalism and offer a caust
 ic remedy for its ravages.\nExpanding on their bludgeoning debut Tub of L
 ard\, Eye Flys is lean and aggressive\, fast and unforgiving. “Trepana
 tion Summer”’s ferocious riffs bore directly into the skull\, mimickin
 g the crude pressure release of the ancient surgical process of the same n
 ame\, Smith crying to “release the pressure” from within a wall of f
 eedback. “Sleep Forever” throws down a thrashing\, infernal groove\, d
 emolishing all in its path as Smith’s craggy guitar figures rise like 
 toxic smoke from the devastation. “Draining Pus” revels in septic slud
 ge\, while “Bananarchy Zoo” manages to strip things down to an even mo
 re lean and incisive realization of the trio’s punishing sonic palette\,
  in an exploration of Smith’s love/hate relationship with his Florida 
 roots. A wall of rippling noise and distortion run as connecting threads t
 hrough the album\, the band’s acerbic humor and raw emotion capturing th
 e perspective and the frustration of the hardworking everyman. The band gr
 apples with the repercussions of coping strategies with healthy skepticism
  and an eye on the gallows.\nEye Flys offers a reassuring reminder that y
 ou haven’t gone mad and you’re not alone – that weird ‘n’ heavy 
 music is still here as a respite from the madness of modern living and an 
 outlet for righteous rage.\n\nSOUR SPIRIT\ntwo brothas who are brothers ma
 king waves of harsh noise with free jazz flourishes\, playing within and i
 n spite of traditional rock structures.-Alex Smith\n

 cheekface/the-first-unitarian-church/\n\nDoors at 7:30pm\nShow starts at 8
 pm\n\n\nCHEEKFACE\nWhen we last left the arguably interesting adventures o
 f Cheekface\, they’d released the minor phenomenon “Emphatically No.
 ” The band’s sophomore album bowed at #1 on Bandcamp’s alternative a
 nd vinyl sales charts\, became a college radio staple\, and propelled the 
 L.A. talk-singing trio into packed houses of Cheek Freaks across the US. S
 o I guess now is a good time for Cheekface to return with their third LP\,
  “Too Much to Ask.”\nYou might say “Too Much to Ask” builds on the
  strengths of the first two Cheekface albums\, but also refines and evolve
 s their sound a little\, and why would I argue with you? The band’s song
 writing battery of guitarist/singer Greg Katz and bassist Amanda Tannen sh
 ow their lyrical trademark\, a strangely inviting sad and sideways wit\, r
 ight from the jump — “life hands you problems\, make problem-ade\,” 
 they announce in the almost-unglued 1-minute-25-second album opener “Whe
 n Life Hands You Problems” — and then across the record’s 11 tracks\
 , the band proceeds to make hay out of many of life’s mysteries.\nThere
 ’s the problematic popularity of quinoa (the what-if-Stephen-Malkmus-fro
 nted-Television headnodder “Pledge Drive”)\, the boundless desires of 
 American imperialists and the political complacency that enables them (the
  relentlessly hooky and bleak “You Always Want to Bomb the Middle East
 ”)\, the physical toll of daily routine (“I would get so much done if 
 I didn’t have to sleep anymore\, but then I would be tired\,” they obs
 erve on The Cars-via-Rosenstock “I Feel So Weird”)\, the questionable 
 marketing of a certain quacky soap bottle doctor (beach-blanket strummer 
 “Election Day\,” which features a guest verse from kindred spirit Sidn
 ey Gish)\, and the seemingly sabotaged pointlessness of it all — pick an
 y track really\, but I like “coffee from the bank / Fritos isn’t free 
 / I only want to be with other people like me” from “We Need a Bigger 
 Dumpster\,” a singalong single that exposes Cheekface’s most fundament
 al components as clear as a deep-sea fish: a simple drum beat\, a nasty ba
 ssline\, a neatly catchy guitar riff\, a suprisingly memorable chorus\, an
 d a funny fatalistic wisdom that unites it all.\nCheekface — comprising 
 Katz\, Tannen\, and drummer Mark “Echo” Edwards — often stick close 
 to the blend of post-punk and power pop they first explored on 2019 debut 
 “Therapy Island” and honed across 2021’s “Emphatically No.” But 
 new to this album\, the chatty indie rock outfit lets the music do the tal
 king at times\, like in the winding dance break of LCDesque “Featured Si
 nger\,” the explosion of guitarmonies on “You Always Want to Bomb the 
 Middle East\,” and the majestic Moog melody of album closer “Vegan Wat
 er.” These excursions give more space to the band’s best punchlines an
 d lighten the weight of their darker thoughts. Meanwhile\, pianos and Casi
 o keyboards and cowbells poke their heads in here and there\; there are so
 me cut and paste samples sprinkled around\; some flotsam and jetsam are us
 ed as percussion\, like a staple gun\, a stainless steel ashtray\, an old 
 vinyl suitcase and a clanky folding chair. They also fit their first balla
 d on this record\, “Election Day\,” next to a screaming 57-second mant
 ra about instant noodles.\nBut even as Cheekface evolves a little\, the al
 bum stays focused on Katz and Tannen’s lyrics about the confounding feel
 ing of the unmoored present. “I think the last year or two has drawn a b
 ig circle around a lot of things we all already knew\, but maybe didn’t 
 know we knew\,” Katz says. “The shock of isolation and the shock of to
 getherness\, the call to activism and the pull of resignation\, wanting th
 e best for your friends but expecting the worst of yourself. The sneaking 
 feeling that your life is mostly funny but a little sad a lot of the time 
 — except for the times when it’s mostly sad but still kinda funny.”\

 w starts at 9pm\n\n\nBABEHOVEN\nBabehoven is a band fronted by singer-song
 writer Maya Bon and collaborator Ryan Albert in Hudson\, NY. Their new alb
 um ‘Water’s Here In You’ is available everywhere on April 26 via Dou
 ble Double Whammy.\nWritten and recorded at the duo’s home studio throug
 hout the winter of 2022–2023\, ‘Water’s Here In You’ comes close o
 n the heels of Babehoven’s debut album ‘Light Moving Time’\, which f
 ollowed an impressively prolific canon of shorter releases dating back to 
 2017\, when Bon founded the project in college. Their latest album continu
 es the thread of the band’s sonic DNA—blending hyper-melodic indie and
  folk rock with shades of shoegaze and the occasional nod toward country. 
 Across twelve varied and meticulous tracks\, Babehoven offers their take o
 n finding connection\, groundedness\, and growth in what we all carry with
 in us.\nAfter finishing the new record\, Babehoven spent much of 2023 on t
 he road—supporting acts like Slow Pulp\, Indigo de Souza\, MJ Lenderman\
 , and more at home and nationwide. Keeping up their prolific track record\
 , the band looks to continue touring and prepping new music throughout 202
 4 and beyond.\n\nGREG MENDEZ\nFor Greg Mendez\, reflection doesn’t mean 
 a static image in a mirror\, or even a face he recognizes. It’s more a k
 aleidoscopic mirage\, where paths taken shapeshift with the prospect of pa
 ths untread\, and the subconscious merges with the intentional. On his sel
 f-titled new album\, the Philadelphia-based songwriter and multi-instrumen
 talist investigates the shaky camera of memory\, striving to carve out a c
 ollage that points to a truth. But there isn’t a regimented actuality he
 re\; instead\, Mendez highlights the merit in many truths\, and many lives
 \, and how even the hardest truths can still contain some humor.\nWhile th
 is is technically Mendez’s third full-length album\, his back catalog bo
 asts an extensive range of EPs and live recordings. He’s a prolific and 
 thoughtful songwriter\, understanding the joy in impulse\, and shying away
  from the clinical sheen of overproduction. 2017’s “¯\\_(ツ)_/¯” 
 and 2020’s Cherry Hell garnered acclaim for their quiet\, lo-fi urgency\
 , exploring themes of addiction and heartbreak with an intentional\, authe
 ntic haze\, and it’s this approach that has solidified Mendez as a stapl
 e in the DIY community for years.\nGreg Mendez was written in fragments\, 
 some stretching across more than a decade\, with Mendez reworking old idea
 s and arrangements\, and others blossoming much more recently. The weight 
 of time––and perhaps the anxiety in running out of it––clouds the 
 album\, as Mendez prods at some painful experiences from his childhood and
  early adulthood. The common thread connecting the characters is their evi
 dent imperfections\, and the various degrees of damage they cause\, both k
 nowingly and unknowingly. But where do we draw the line between a good per
 son and a bad person? For Mendez\, it’s never been that easy.\n“There
 ’s a lot of pretty bleak memories in the songs but one thing that I hope
  comes through is that nothing is ever fully dark\,” he explains. While 
 recognizing the severity of certain situations\, Mendez is also careful to
  showcase the absurdity of our reality\, and how that can often highlight 
 a softness around the edges. Opener “Rev. John / Friend” begins with a
  cartoonish organ\, like a sermon waiting to start\, correlating with the 
 album’s artwork: a Virgin Mary staring at Mendez’s name. It’s a smir
 k at the serious\, where earnesty can still be encouraged\, and the light 
 and the dark can effortlessly co-exist.\nThroughout the album\, Mendez ext
 ends an empathetic and relatable hand. The scrappy-pop of “Goodbye / Tro
 uble” waits for “the sound of God\,” searching for a sense of love o
 r purpose\, but the searcher falls apart in the process. The stripped back
 \, finger-picked “Best Behavior” probes the spite and immaturity that 
 can arise when we feel hurt or wronged\, and how lonely that can leave us.
  “Maria” mimics those moments when we reach back to a story and find o
 urselves immersed in its scenery\, using melodic swells to charge like a m
 emory that floats in front of us\, creating a gauze until we manage to tea
 r ourselves out of it. “Everytime you say you wanna know me I get anxiou
 s\, cause I would probably tell you about some dumb shit\,” the song beg
 ins\, glancing at those who also feel wary to show their full selves.\nMen
 dez encourages us to look beyond the rigidity of a one\, true self. Some o
 f the “I’s” on Greg Mendez are not Mendez at all but someone unknown
 \, a person formed to explore the shadows in his periphery. Writing from a
  different perspective doesn’t happen intentionally\, and Mendez only te
 nds to notice it after sitting with the song for some time. “It’s kind
  of like dreams\, where they end up being the stuff that your brain is pro
 cessing\, but you’re not aware that you’re doing it\,” he says. It
 ’s an exhale\, where Mendez allows his instincts to flourish.\nGreg Mend
 ez is an intimate dialogue between the chapters we’ve experienced\, and 
 how they can inform the reality we perceive. It’s a reminder that we are
  constantly shifting\, ever-changing selves and that if we ruminate too lo
 ng\, we may find ourselves stuck in the seriousness of it all. Here\, Mend
 ez allows us to take the time to notice what happens outside of the framew
 ork we may have built for ourselves\, and the beauty that can occur when w
 e finally do.\n

 \n\nPOUTY\nForgot About Me is Rachel Gagliardi’s full-length debut under
  the name Pouty. The album was written and recorded throughout 2022 in Los
  Angeles and Philadelphia with the Superweaks’ Evan Bernard and Chris Ba
 glivo (featuring Jarret Nathan and Cat Park). Forgot About Me’s nine tra
 cks speak to a series of realizations about desire\, self-sabotage\, denia
 l\, acceptance\, and aging\, all set atop fuzzy power pop. The album has r
 eceived glowing reviews from critics including Pitchfork\, Stereogum\, and
  Paste Magazine\, and is out now on Get Better Records.\nPouty began in 20
 13 when Gagliardi and Michelle Zauner (Japanese Breakfast) collaborated on
  a solo-song-a-day-project. At the time\, Gagliardi was one-half of Slutev
 er\, whose bratty punk songs continue to captivate new audiences on social
  media. She later joined Upset\, which featured former members of Hole and
  Vivian Girls. Pouty’s debut EP\, Take Me to Honey Island\, came out in 
 2016 and over the following years\, Gagliardi shared a handful of EPs and 
 singles including 2021’s “Bambina\,” which reflects on the changes t

  from Philadelphia\, Pennsylvania. The band consists of ex-Cayetana member
  Augusta Koch\, ex-Three Man Cannon member Matt Schimelfenig\, ex-Spirit o

  band from the south west of England fronted by Iona Cairns along with Tho

 there of having that bare minimum of self love\, things inevitably tend to
  tarnish.”\nAs Youth Fountain prepares to move forward\, the future perf

 lend of emo-tinged punk to soundtrack reflecting on every single life deci

 Free Throw\, Can’t Swim\, and Chris Farren cemented Youth Fountain’s s
 weat-soaked sound as something best experienced live – all while dodging
  a few stray elbows and overzealous crowd-surfers.\nNow once again\, Zanon
  finds himself as a solo artist following the departure of co-vocalist Cod
 y Muraro in mid-2020 – but this time\, he’s exactly where he wants to 
 be. Youth Fountain’s new release\, Letters To Our Former Selves – Acou
 stic EP\, re-introduces Zanon’s project to the world\, reimagining fan f
 avorite material from the 2019 LP of the same name. The four-song collecti
 on tones down Youth Fountain’s trademark frenetic energy in favor of mor

 ding it. Not content to let the more serene setting mellow him out\, Zanon
  pushes his vocals to the limit across the EP\, stepping into the spotligh
 t with the confidence and chops to assuage those concerned about the band
 ’s future.\nWith a new energy and determination empowering Zanon\, there
 ’s a lot on the horizon for Youth Fountain. He’s been spending the pan
 demic hard at work readying the next full-band LP\, slated for release in 
 early 2021\, and re-centering himself on why he began making music in the 
 first place. In many ways\, this musical rebirth is the best thing that co

 h his own songwriting ability and bravely dare to continue pushing its lim
 its under no one’s terms but his own.\n“It’s so freeing to not have

 \nShow starts at 8pm\n\n\nSUBHUMANS\nSubhumans are one of the most influen
 tial bands from the UK Anarcho-Punk scene of the 80’s\, filed right alon
 gside Crass and Conflict\, and just as relevant today as they were during 
 the darkest days of Thatcher’s Britain. Take your choice in how to label
  them – Punk\, UK82\, Crusty\, etc\, – there lies the attraction and c
 onsequent reason for their popularity\, the band epitomizes non-conformity
  and connects with people in many different scenes.\nForming in 1980\, rec
 ording and releasing a series of live and demo cassette tapes on their own
  Bluurg label\, they continued to release music throughout the 80’s – 
 building a powerhouse of a back catalog that completely stands the test of
  time. Their debut LP ‘The Day the Country Died’ (1983)\, with its Orw
 ellian influence\, is considered by many to be a classic and has sold in e
 xcess of 100\,000 copies. The second album\, ‘From the Cradle to the Gra
 ve’\, came swiftly the following year (1984)\, and although the same fre
 netic pace is in evidence\, this marks a significant musical development f
 or the band. In 1985 Subhumans broke up\, citing the usual musical differe
 nces\, although had managed to release a third\, maybe ironically entitled
 \, LP ‘Worlds Apart.’ A final EP was released posthumously in 1986\, 
 ‘29:29 Split Vision\,’ a further demonstration of how far the band had
  come musically from their initial leanings.\nDick Lucas subsequently join
 ed Culture Shock and then formed political ska-punk band Citizen Fish in 1
 990\, both bands releasing many albums\, and still playing today. Subhuman
 s had a couple of reunion shows in the nineties\, before a more permanent 
 return for the 21st century\, including 2 major tours of the US\, the firs
 t resulting in the ‘Live in a Dive’ LP. The Subhumans then released a 
 further studio album in 2007\, ‘Internal Riot\,’ again on Bluurg Recor
 ds. The band is still passionate and angry\, illustrated by Dick saying 
 “Being in a band is the source of most of my passion and drive! The live
  experience of sharing it with people keeps it ongoing\, the release of an
 ger\, frustration and initially negative/destructive states of mind is a r
 elease from the downward spiral of keeping it all bottled up and it feels 
 positive/constructive as a result.”\nThe band have recently written ten 
 new songs\, which Pirates Press Records are thrilled to be releasing\, and
  are embarking on a year of touring in both Europe and North America! Firs
 t a split with The Restarts before a 12” of their own comes out in Octob
 er of 2019! The social and political commentary of bands like Subhumans fo
 rged a path\, along with their contemporaries\, for punk to change lives a
 nd opinions around the world. Sadly the things they sang about forty years
  ago are largely just as important now\, sometimes more so in an age of Tr
 ump and Brexit. We can’t wait to hear more of what they have to say abou
 t the current political climate\, the immense imbalance of wealth and powe
 r\, and the causes they hold near and dear to their hearts.\n\nFEA\nSan An
 tonio-based band Fea embody one of the most vital tenets of punk: total an
 d unapologetic freedom\, fearlessly expressed with both fury and joy. Prod
 uced by Chicana punk legend Alice Bag\, their sophomore album No Novelties
  finds Fea following their instincts into entirely unexpected directions (
 e.g.\, covering an early-’90s pop anthem from Mexican superstar Gloria T
 revi\, trash-talking en Français on a yé-yé-inspired track called “Me
 rde”). But even in its most playful moments\, No Novelties channels a cl
 assic-punk ferocity\, endlessly backing Fea’s sticky melodies with break
 neck rhythms\, blistering guitar riffs\, and boldly nuanced vocal work.\nT
 he follow-up to their self-titled debut –a 2016 release that prompted Ig
 gy Pop to praise Fea in the pages of Rolling Stone\, with the Village Voic
 e ranking “No Hablo Espanol” among the year’s best protest songs—N
 o Novelties takes its title from the album-closing “Girl Band.” “It
 ’s referring to that stereotype of how female bands are some kind of nov
 elty with no real talent\,” says Lopez. “But that’s not us at all: w
 e know how to play our instruments\, we know how to write great songs. So 
 ‘Girl Band’ is basically a middle finger to anyone who underestimates 
 us.”\nRecording at Sonic Ranch (a studio in the Texas border town of Tor
 nillo)\, Fea brought both raw intensity and greater complexity to the maki
 ng of No Novelties\, composing more intricately layered arrangements and p
 ushing into heavier emotional terrain than ever before. On lead single “
 Let Me Down\,” the band offsets their frenetic energy with graceful thre
 e-part harmonies\, their lyrics speaking to social media’s constant enab
 ling of self-absorption. “Social media is a great platform that could po
 tentially be used in a lot of positive ways\, but it’s become this weird
  thing where everyone just puts themselves on display because they’re so
  obsessed with getting attention\,” says Martinez of the song’s inspir
 ation.\nWith No Novelties driven by Fea’s naturalistic use of bilingual 
 lyrics\, “Ya Se” injects Spanish-sung gang vocals into a cathartic mid
 dle-class anthem. “It’s about living paycheck-to-paycheck\, and gettin
 g caught in that cycle where you don’t make enough money but you spend t
 oo much on things you don’t need\, just to get some relief from reality\
 ,” says Martinez. “It also came from thinking about how a lot of peopl
 e in our generation are in a worse financial place than our parents\, and 
 how sometimes that makes us feel like failures—even though I don’t thi
 nk it’s necessarily true that we’ve failed.” Elsewhere on the album\
 , Fea turn confessional on songs like “ICU” (a darkly charged portrait
  of a toxic relationship) and take on a celebratory mood on such tracks as
  “Itch” (a surf-punk-leaning look at the scuzzy glory of touring). “
 We don’t glamorize touring in ‘Itch\,’ because for us it’s never g
 lamorous\,” Martinez points out. “It’s dirty and smelly and uncomfor
 table and we love it—we always embrace the dirty.”\nBorn from the ashe
 s of Diaz and Alva’s beloved former band Girl in a Coma\, Fea got togeth
 er in 2015 and soon carved out a kinetic sound shaped by the eclecticism o
 f their homeland. “We all listen to punk and post-punk and riot grrrl mu
 sic\, and we grew up on oldies and Latin music stars and so many other thi
 ngs—so there’s this whole melting-pot effect that definitely comes out
  in the songs we write\,” says Diaz. After putting out their self-titled
  debut—an album co-produced by Alice Bag\, Against Me!’s Laura Jane Gr
 ace\, and Babes in Toyland’s Lori Barbero—Fea earned acclaim from such
  outlets as NPR (who hailed the band as “Latina punk at its finest”)\,
  and soon began taking their rambunctious live show to venues across the c
 ountry.\nOver the past few years\, Fea have toured with both Against Me! a
 nd Babes in Toyland\, as well as with punk icons Agent Orange. And as thei
 r audience continues to expand\, the band aims to instill every show with 
 the same sense of solidarity\, purpose\, and irrepressible fun found in th
 eir albums. “We’re serious girls\, but there’s a lot of humor involv
 ed in everything we do\,” says Alva. “We try to put on a really rowdy 
 show\; we’re always moving around a lot and always smiling at each other
 . I think everyone in the crowd can tell we’re having a blast\, and hope
 fully that vibe and energy gets transferred onto them. Our favorite shows 
 are the ones where we can really feel that community between us and the au
 dience.”\n\nDARK THOUGHTS\n“Dark Thoughts\, one of the few pop-punk ba
 nds it’s OK for hardcore folks to like.”\nDark Thoughts’ 3rd LP is o
 ut\, and I think it’s their best one yet. If you heard the first two\, t
 his one is a little different\, with less of a stylized\, Ramones-influenc
 ed sound. There are very few bells and whistles (except for the literal be
 lls on the climactic closing track)\, and an apparently simple formula: ta
 ke some smart and heartfelt lyrics\, find a 3 or 4-chord progression that 
 goes along with their tone\, and bash it out as power chords with Ramones-
 style drums playing at an appropriate tempo (mid-paced to super fast\, dep
 ending on the tone). For most bands\, that would be a fast track to a bunc
 h of generic and boring songs\, but for Dark Thoughts the minimal ornament
 ation highlights how great these songs are. The lyrics give me all the fee
 ls (as the kids were saying in the not-too-distant past)\, and every track
  has the fist-pumping\, energetic and anthemic sound that makes Dark Thoug
 hts one of the few pop-punk bands it’s OK for hardcore folks to like. Th
 e overall tone and vibe is similar to what I consider the peak period of S
 creeching Weasel\, i.e. their run of LPs from My Brain Hurts through How t
 o Make Enemies and Irritate People\, but if you whittled those records dow
 n to the faster\, darker tracks like “Hanging Around\,” “The Science
  of Myth\,” “Every Night\,” etc. Like most of the individual tracks\
 , the LP is short\, but it’s such a thrilling listen that I often play i
 t a few times in a row\, something I rarely do with other records. I’ve 
 been playing Must Be Nice since the digital version first went online back
  in December\, and it shows no signs of leaving the “current listening
 ” pile any time soon.\n– Daniel Lupton\, Sorry State Records\n

  times since their debut LP “Burst” hopped onto the scene in March of 
 2020\, but crossing the pond wasn’t an opportunity that had come their w

 ed the band the idea of coming to his actual home in Norway to make their 
 upcoming sophomore full-length. The offer turned out to be one the band co

 uis Philippe\, Pete Astor and Papernut Cambridge)\n\nJEANINES\nBrooklyn’
 s Jeanines specialize in ultra-short bursts of energetic but melancholy mi
 nor-key pop. With influences that run deep into the most crucial tributari
 es of DIY pop — Messthethics\, the Television Personalities\, Marine Gir
 ls\, early Pastels\, Dolly Mixture — they’ve crafted a style that is a
 s individual as it is just plain pleasurable. Alicia Jeanine’s pure\, un
 affected voice muses wistfully on the illusions of time\, while My Teenage
  Stride/Mick Trouble mastermind Jed Smith’s frantic Motown-esque drummin
 g and inventive bass playing provide a thrilling rhythmic foundation.\n“
 Winter In The Dark” and a lovely\, jaunty cover of The Siddeleys’ “F
 alling Off Of My Feet Again” provide great insight into what Jeanines ar
 e about. 60s-meet-80s melodies combine with timeless guitar jangle in a wa
 y that recalls everything from The Aislers Set and Saturday Looks Good To 
 Me to more recent DIY pop groups like Parsnip and Chook Race. Album opener
  “Either Way\,” “Hits The Bone” and “Where We Go” hearken back
  to some of the most intriguing bands of the C86/C88 era\, when bands like
  Jesse Garon & The Desperadoes crafted perfect pop gems enlivened by the i
 nspiration of punk.\nGorgeous songs like “Where I Stand\,” “Too Late
 ” and “In This House” are windows into Alicia’s lyrical style and 
 inspiration. She expands: “I’m kind of obsessed with mortality and how
  weird the passage of time is so I think my lyrics reflect that. I definit
 ely lean into that kind of melancholy state of mind when trying to think o
 f lyrics\, while trying to avoid cliches!” The marriage of the minor-key
  melodies and melancholic lyrics is powerful and make Alicia’s songs all
  the more memorable\, especially so on songs like “No Home\,” with its
  echoes of girl harmony post-punk groups like Grass Widow and Household.\n
 Clearly\, with 16 great songs included\, there is a lot at work here on th
 is standout debut album. Jeanines have been compared to such cult pop icon
 s as Dear Nora\, Black Tambourine\, and more recent acts like Veronica Fal
 ls and Girl Ray\, but their dark\, modal melodies and pensive\, philosophi
 cal lyrics\, along with Smith’s versatile but ever-economical musicality
 \, ensure them a place of their own in today’s crowded but boisterously 
 healthy DIY pop scene.\n\nTHE NATVRAL\nThe Natvral (Kip Berman\, former fr
 ontperson of The Pains of Being Pure at Heart) returns with his second sol
 o album\, Summer of No Light on Dirty Bingo Records. \nOn his second al
 bum as The Natvral – a spirited\, beautifully observed collection of rou
 gh and ready songcraft – the former Pains of Being Pure at Heart frontpe
 rson was eyeing the past while dealing with an inescapable present. In 202
 0\, in the early stages of lockdown\, Berman began writing songs that refl
 ected on a world that had seemingly ended – while contending with the ne
 eds of his young family seeking solace in the familiar. “After putting m
 y children to bed\, I spent many a late night in the basement with my guit
 ar and let my mind wander to the places where I could no longer go\,” he
  says. “Initially\, a lot of the songs were about getting as far away fr
 om the reality of my moment as possible.” \nHe drew parallels with anot
 her tumultuous summer. “The record’s title\, Summer of No Light\, is t
 aken from the climate crisis of 1816\,” he says. Often referred to as Th
 e Year Without a Summer\, that year a massive volcanic eruption in Indones
 ia darkened much of the world’s sky. The resulting ash brought dramatic 
 global cooling and widespread famine\, hitting Western Europe especially h
 ard. While he initially sought escape from the isolation in which he foun
 d himself\, soon the solace of home and family life began to seep its way 
 into the music “The routines of domesticity were often unwelcome\, and a
 lways exhausting – but probably mentally helpful. I was isolated\, but n
 ot alone.” Despite the many graveyard romps that populate the record\, i
 t’s the moments that celebrate home that gives this album its heart.  \
 nSummer of No Light is an album that’s born of a precise moment\, yet re
 vels in anachronism. Collapsing time to make a little bit of sense of this
  one\, Berman feels artistically rejuvenated\, drawing on histories large 
 and small to breathe new life and perspective on his own. “It was a time
  that is now almost unspeakable – not because the tragedy was too profou
 nd or in any way trivial – but because we were all there.”\nplus ENGLA

 /r5productions.com/event/the-umbrellas/philamoca/philadelphia-pennsylvania
 /\n\nDoors at 7:30pm\nShow starts at 8pm\n\n\nTHE UMBRELLAS\nThe Umbrellas
  are four renegade romantics crafting irresistible indiepop hymns. The ban
 d’s self-titled 2021 debut album was a breakout moment\, winning critica
 l praise and fueling tours with everyone from labelmates Papercuts to Fuck
 ed Up. Follow-up LP Fairweather Friend goes a step further – balancing
  the rambunctious sonic attack of their live shows with studio craft and f
 inesse\, allowing the San Francisco four-piece to become the band they’v
 e always aspired to be.\nIt’s a record overflowing with highlights. The 
 addictive\, upbeat melodies of introductory track ‘Three Cheers!’ are 
 matched to an impactful percussive punch\; ‘Say What You Mean’ finds T
 he Umbrellas working with total confidence\, letting the song ride out to 
 its chiming conclusion\, four voices working in precision. ‘When You Fin
 d Out’ offers rotating notes of guitar punctuated by a vocal that pushes
  past angst to accept a world full of hope. A lean 10 track affair\, it gr
 asps towards beatific pop while fuelled by a sense of risk-taking and the 
 precision that comes from long months on the road.\nThe Umbrellas coalesce
 d in 2018 around a group of musicians with connections to the legendary Sa
 n Francisco record emporium Amoeba Music. Singer and guitarist Matt Ferrer
 a had previous links with bassist Nick Oka\, as well as the powerhouse dru
 mmer Keith Frerichs. A chance encounter with Morgan Stanley singing karaok
 e at a Fourth of July party cemented the line-up around an avowed thirst f
 or melody. “All of us love really earnest pop songs\,” Nick points out
 . “I guess we got to a point in our lives where we wanted to be genuine.
 ”\nPlaying shows at San Francisco’s vital DIY redoubt Hit Gallery\, Th
 e Umbrellas would share line-ups with local heroes such as April Magazine 
 and Cindy. Recording their debut album across a two-day spell at Matt’s 
 parents’ house\, the results won a devoted cult following. The experienc
 e of frequent touring bonded them tightly and allowed the volume to tick u
 p a little higher (and higher…) and and feeding a desire for their next 
 record to more closely mirror the energy of their live shows. “I think w
 e got tired of people saying\, oh you’re so much louder than I thought y
 ou’d be!” laughs Matt. “Our early recordings are sweet and earnest
 … and we wanted it to be louder.”\nKicking off sessions in November 20
 22\, the band used an ad hoc space Matt created in his basement\, which al
 lowed the sessions to be a little more relaxed in terms of timescale than 
 their debut. “We gave ourselves more space for this album\,” says Keit
 h. “We wanted time to sit on the songs\, and really work on them.”\nCa
 pturing their thrilling live dynamic on tape\, The Umbrellas are at once m
 ore physical and yet also more controlled on their new album. Take opening
  track ‘Three Cheers!’ – the peppy\, sun-soaked rush masks a barbed 
 lyric\, courtesy of Nick Oka. “It’s a pseudo-political song about powe
 r struggles that occur in a job situation\, or a friend group. It’s an o
 bservational song.”\n‘Toe The Line’ has an unkempt\, rollicking sens
 e of energy\, the playful relationship analogy of the lyric pushed to the 
 speed of light by Keith’s just-chaotic-enough punk drumming. ‘When You
  Find Out’ meanwhile epitomises their unified\, egalitarian way of makin
 g music – with The Umbrellas\, each voice counts. “It sounds different
  from any song we’ve ever written together\,” says Morgan. “It shows
  how much we’ve grown. Trust helps us to build the songs. It’s definit
 ely a team effort.”\nIt’s also a record of ambition. ‘Say What You M
 ean’ stretches past the four-minute mark\, the viola performance informe
 d by Estonian minimalist composer Arvo Pärt. ‘Gone’ was the first son
 g attempted for the new album\, and the last they actually finished\, endl
 ess re-writes transforming it into a manifesto of control and release. Tak
 en as a whole ‘Fairweather Friend‘ is a bold indiepop triumph\, crafte
 d with purpose and attention. Taking their time over each note\, the four-
 piece have strengthened their songwriting\, adding depth and assurance whi
 le unlocking their potential. Some bonds last a lifetime – The Umbrellas
  are ready to capture your heart.\n\n2ND GRADE\nRinging from hi-fi headpho
 nes and blown-out boombox speakers alike comes the overloaded guitar geniu
 s of Easy Listening\, a record of rock ‘n’ roll daydreams and termina
 l boredom\, and 2nd Grade’s long awaited second LP on Double Double Wha
 mmy. Like a blue slushy on a hot day\, Easy Listening is a sweet respite
 . Like the Blue Angels touching down on the Las Vegas Strip\, Easy Listen
 ing is impossible to ignore. And like a janitor mopping up beer on the fl
 oor of the Hollywood Palladium in 1972\, hours after the Rolling Stones ha
 ve finished “Ventilator Blues” and climbed onto the bus\, Easy Listen
 ing knows the glory and cost of escapism\, abandon\, and the soul of rock
  ‘n’ roll. Philadelphia’s 2nd Grade (Peter Gill\, Catherine Dwyer\,
  Jon Samuels\, David Settle\, and Fran Lyons) is a band both obsessed w
 ith and worthy of rock stardom\, and Easy Listening proves their status 
 as virtuosos of the power pop renaissance.\nSonically and lyrically\, Eas
 y Listening pays tribute to a guitar lineage linking the Stones to the Fl
 amin’ Groovies\, to Redd Kross and Guided By Voices. With its spiraling 
 hooks and handclapped quarter note beat\, lead single “Strung Out On You
 ” sounds like an alternate reality post-Radio City Big Star cut. In 2nd
  Grade’s world\, music history is a prism\, not a linear progression. Fa
 mous teens transcend time on the outro to “Teenage Overpopulation\,” a
  shouted cacophony of names including Tommy Stinson\, Lizzie McGuire\, and
  Joan of Arc. The line between the love of an audience and that of a roman
 tic partner is blurred on songs like “Hands Down” and “Me & My Blue 
 Angels.” Across the album\, hi-fi and lo-fi styles splice together\; pla
 yful references and surreal hints of impossibility build a complex\, belie
 vable world atop a foundation of simple and sticky melodies that resonate 
 on very first listen.\nAs usual\, 2nd Grade are generous with their album 
 offerings\, packing 16 songs on Easy Listening. Most tracks clock in arou
 nd two minutes\, almost indulgent compared to the average runtime on 2nd G
 rade’s debut 24-track LP Hit to Hit. On Easy Listening however\, the
  band develops their theory of quantum teenage energy\, composed of equal 
 parts sincerity and swagger. Basement drums and bass run full speed ahead.
  Gill’s vocal deliveries range from sweet to snotty. Guitar performances
  from Samuels and Dwyer similarly alternate between clean power-pop jangle
  and lo-fi scuzz\, dedicated above all to the band’s lodestar: riffs tha
 t rule.\nEasy Listening doesn’t just reference its larger-than-life for
 ebearers – it builds a multi-layered dreamworld of punk and rock mytholo
 gy from beginning to end\, allowing both band and listener to revel\, at l
 east for a moment\, in radio star euphoria. “We’re MVPs of MTV/Don’t
  have to live like a refugee/We’re VIPs of VH1/Learning to fly and free 
 fallin\,” Gill sings on Track 1\, “Cover of Rolling Stone.” Later\, 
 on “Planetarium\,” Gill colors his starry daydream with everyday patho
 s: “My lawyer says not to talk to the press/but I just like the way that
  they listen.” Across the album\, yesteryear’s guitar heroes show up a
 s totemic symbols\, transmuting their own worlds of meaning into new expre
 ssions in Gill’s overactive imagination.\nFor all its abundance\, Gill
 ’s imagination is also desperate. The brilliance of Easy Listening lie
 s in its longing\, and in the blindingly clear difference between the myth
  of rockstar ecstasy and the reality of ennui\, stagnation\, and addiction
 . Like anybody\, the voice of 2nd Grade just wants somebody to listen and 
 there’s nothing more human than fantasizing about the things we don’t 
 have. Like 2nd Grade\, we’re all children\, “dreaming of dreaming of d
 reaming a dream.”\n\nTHE SMASHING TIMES\nWhen you call your band Smashin
 g Times you can’t help instantly getting the flavour of the Television P
 ersonalties and Dan Treacy but on their second album\, the band deliver th
 at and so much more. This really is a fusion of psychedelic\, twee and fre
 akbeat that will make your heart skip and your head smile. The guitars shi
 mmer\, strum and jangle whilst the vocals float effortlessly on top of the
  efficient rhythm section. Every song is a bundle of energy with hooks tha
 t come both instantly and after multiple plays. Without doubt\, if it had 
 been recorded in the 80’s would have been released on Whaam or Dreamworl
 d but luckily for you pop kids this 2023 and K have the honour of releasin
 g it. (Sean Forbes)\n

 \nTEETHE\nTeethe is a band from Texas. Formed in 2020\, the band’s epony
 mous debut album is a collection of songs pieced together over time – a 
 sonic collage of fragmented recordings and half-finished tracks made whole
  in the midst of isolation.\nWhile attending the University of North Texas
  in Denton\, TX\, a small college town outside of Dallas\, members of the 
 band met and began performing in various other groups. They eventually mov
 ed in together\, leading the group to start recording as a whole.\nNow spr
 ead between Dallas and Austin\, the band continues to record their own mus
 ic\, releasing two singles\, Tag and Lucky\, in 2022\, and most recentl
 y partnered with Saddle Creek to release their newest single\, Moon.\n

 ylvania/\n\nDoors at 7pm\nShow starts at 8pm\n\n\nTHE SPITS\nIn an era tha
 t relies so heavily on quick-hit bands\, there are very few things that ar
 e truly part of the subculture and not just the passing zeitgeist du jour.
  Closing in on three decades\, The Spits have signified the crossroads bet
 ween punk mayhem and well-honed songwriting\, creating some of the most un
 hinged and anthemic tracks in underground music while standing tall enough
  to be uttered in the same breath as names like Jay Reatard\, Dead Moon\, 
 Ty Segall and more.\nThe Spits are readying their highly anticipated VI\, 
 due May 1 via their own Thriftstore Records imprint. Recorded by Erik Nerv
 ous on cassette four track\, the band’s new LP VI is ten hummable tracks
 \, shrouded in chainsaw punk that mesh the wild showmanship of party-rock 
 legends Van Halen and the leather-clad toughness and songwriting chops of 
 the Misfits. Marking a “return to roots’’ approach for the LP\, the 
 band decided to record and write VI in the basements of Kalamazoo and Gran
 d Rapids\, Michigan over the course of several spurts of activity\, each y
 ielding a few new songs from a terrible drum kit with a literal thrift sto
 re guitar. “We’ve only been into an actual studio like three times\,
 ” admits Sean Wood. “I don’t think we’ve had one record that was r
 ecorded all in one place\, this may be the closest thing. And for these so
 ngs we’d record a couple tracks\, step away and go back at it later– s
 ometimes weeks later. You know\, take our time.”\nOriginally from Kalama
 zoo\, Michigan\, brothers Sean and Erin Wood formed The Spits with Lance P
 helps in 1993 after realizing rock had gone limp\, hated partying and just
  plain wasn’t fun anymore. And even though they didn’t even know how t
 o play\, the self-professed deliquents who grew up with New Orleans–styl
 e jazz and bluegrass “got cultured” and formed a band dead set on remi
 nding the world how to have a good time. The Spits didn’t fit in with th
 e punks or the garageheads when they landed in Seattle two years later\, b
 ut carved out their own path with a series of empty open mic nights and pa
 rties under a bridge in the University District. Things started snowballin
 g a year or two later with a good word from Mudhoney’s Steve Turner and 
 a reputation for livewire gigs.\nBy the late 90s/early 00s\, The Spits wer
 e almost as famous for rowdy shows and outrageous costumes as they were fo
 r their acid-fried melodic rippers. Releasing five LPs over the next decad
 e-plus\, in addition to EPs and 7-inches\, the gospel of The Spits spread 
 far and wide\, expanding the band’s live legend further and further whil
 e giving more fans the chance to hear their uniquely catchy songwriting an
 d punk mayhem. And while several band members have come and gone since the
 ir formation\, including Wayne Draves and Josh Kramer\, The Spits have nev
 er lost their edge\, never lost their live chops and most importantly\, ne
 ver lost that sense of beer-soaked chaos.\nThe Spits have taken their time
  on this record and that’s meant a long\, cold nine years with no new ma
 terial. Legions of fans are frothing at the mouth for VI\, and clocking in
  at 17+ minutes\, The Spits are back and things are the same as it ever wa
 s. Yet this time\, the brothers Wood and Co. are adamant about letting the
  fans know that VI is a return to their roots– more deceptively simple p
 unk from these instigators and legends in their own time. For fans of the 
 band\, to-the-point melodicism and good old-fashioned rock ‘n roll\, VI 
 isn’t just the name of the Spits’ LP\, it’s also the number of insta
 nt-classic records in a row.\n

 \n\n\nGRAILS\nRather than pick up where they left off\, Grails take the sk
 y-high riff-based heaviness of their earlier albums and distill it into a 
 nuanced\, widescreen opus. The perennial influences of mid-20th century We
 stern film scores\, obscure library music\, and psychedelic krautrock are 
 indelibly imprinted\, but Chalice Hymnalexudes an eerie patience in unfurl
 ing the many layers of its subtle details. Produced by the band over the p
 ast five years\, Chalice Hymnal bears some of the European psych and exper
 imental hip-hop production techniques of founding members Alex Hall and Em
 il Amos’ other group\, Lilacs & Champagne. Amos’ meditative metal band
 \, Om\, and longtime singer-songwriter project\, Holy Sons\, also naturall
 y find their way into the Chalice cauldron. Rounding out their line-up\, c
 ofounder Zak Riles (also of experimental kraut-psych trio\, Watter) layers
  synths and programming into an electronic-prog hybrid that pushes Grailsf
 urther into the deep end\, displaying a profound resonance\, both musicall
 y and emotionally. No one else sounds like Grails\, and on Chalice Hymnal 
 they sound more like themselves than ever before.\n\nSOMA\nSOMA is a group
  of multi instrumentalists who play a blend of meditative soundscapes wove
 n together with traditional Indian kirtan music and inspired folk songs. T
 he result is a Sonic psychedelic tapestry of Esoteric mantras\, Dynamic rh
 ythms and Devotional prayers. SOMA’s live performances are as eclectic a
 s their recordings\, landing them in Temples\, Churches\, Concert Halls\, 
 Bars and even Cremation Grounds. Without exception each song\, vibration\,

 o: https://r5productions.com/event/waxahatchee/the-fillmore/philadelphia-p
 ennsylvania/\n\nDoors at 7pm\nShow starts at 8pm\n\n\nWAXAHATCHEE\nOne of 
 the hardest working singer-songwriters in the game is named Katie Crutchfi
 eld. She was born in Alabama\, grew up near Waxahatchee Creek. Skipped tow
 n and struck out on her own as Waxahatchee. That was over a decade ago. Cr
 utchfield says she never knew the road would lead her here\, but after six
  critically acclaimed albums\, she’s never felt more confident in hersel
 f as an artist. While her sound has evolved from lo-fi folk to lush alt-ti
 nged country\, her voice has always remained the same. Honest and close\, 
 poetic with Southern lilting. Much like Carson McCullers’s Mick Kelly\, 
 determined in her desires and convictions\, ready to tell whoever will lis
 ten.\nAnd after years of being sober and stable in Kansas City–after yea
 rs of sacrificing herself to her work and the road–Crutchfield has arriv
 ed at her most potent songwriting yet. On her new album\, Tigers Blood\, C
 rutchfield emerges as a powerhouse–an ethnologist of the self–forever 
 dedicated to revisiting her wins and losses. But now she’s arriving at r
 evelations and she ain’t holding them back.\nCrutchfield says that she w
 rote most of the songs on ‘Tigers Blood’ during a “hot hand spell\,
 ” while on tour in the end of 2022. And when it came time to record\, Cr
 utchfield returned to her trusted producer Brad Cook\, who brought her sou
 nd to a groundbreaking turning point on 2020’s Saint Cloud.\nThey hunker
 ed down at Sonic Ranch in Tornillo\, Texas–a border town known for cotto
 n and pecans–and searched for another turn\, waited for a sign. Initiall
 y\, MJ Lenderman\, Southern indie-rock wunderkind (much like Crutchfield w
 hen she started out) came to play electric guitar and sing on “Right Bac
 k To It.” But as soon as they tracked it\, Cook told Lenderman he had to
  stay for the rest of the album. And he did.\n“Right Back To It” is 
 ‘Tigers Blood’’s lead single. A nod to country duets like Gram and E
 mmylou\, winding over a steadfast banjo from Phil Cook. Together\, Crutchf
 ield and Lenderman harmonize on the chorus: “I’ve been yours for so lo
 ng/We come right back to it/I let my mind run wild/Don’t know why I do i
 t/But you just settle in/Like a song with no end.” Crutchfield says it
 ’s the first real love song she’s ever written.\nThe song “Bored” 
 opens with blase drum beats from Spencer Tweedy that crash under Crutchfie
 ld as she throws her voice high: “I can get along/ My spine’s a rotted
  two by four/Barely hanging on/My benevolence just hits the floor.” Lend
 erman’s scuzzy riffs and Nick Bockrath’s climbing pedal steel add powe
 r to the album’s most ‘Southern Rock’ a la Drive-By Truckers moment.
 \n“365” is a story of recognition told from a hard-won place of self-a
 cceptance/forgiveness. Crutchfield initially started writing it for Wynonn
 a Judd\, with whom she has written and performed in the past\, until the l
 yrics started hitting closer and closer to home. The writer Annie Ernaux s
 ays\, “writing is to fight forgetting.” Like Lucinda Williams\, Crutch
 field’s lyrics are memoir. Throughout ‘Tigers Blood’ Crutchfield is 
 addressing a “you\,” but the ‘you’ in “365” evokes raw closene
 ss\, vulnerability. “Ya ain’t had much luck but grace is/In the eye of
  the beholder/And I had my own ideas but/I carried you on my shoulders\, a
 nyways.”\n“365” is essentially ‘Tigers Blood’’s aria about add
 iction\, with little to no accompaniment to Crutchfield’s voice. Her bac
 king band is hushed\, as if the spotlight’s coming down on her\, alone o
 n the stage\, giving her testimony. Crutchfield slings her voice with arre
 sting precision\, reaching its highest harmony on the whole album. “So w
 hen you kill\, I kill/And when you ache\, I ache/And we both haunt this ol
 d lifeless town/And when you fail\, I fail/ When you fly\, I fly/And it’
 s a long way to come back down.”\n“365” circles back to the beginnin
 g of ‘Tigers Blood\,’ where Crutchfield’s words ring clear as a bell
 . Album opener “3 Sisters” starts with Crutchfield singing over hymn-l
 ike piano chords: “I pick you up inside a hopeless prayer/I see you beho
 lden to nothing/I make a living crying it ain’t fair/And not budging.”
  ‘Tigers Blood’ is Crutchfield at her most confident and resilient. St
 aring straight at the truth\, forgiving but not forgetting\, not batting a
 n eye.\n— Ashleigh Bryant Phillips\n\nTIM HEIDECKER\nBest known for his 
 work as a comedian\, writer\, and actor\, Tim Heidecker is also an accompl
 ished musician and songwriter whose tunes don’t necessarily have to rely
  upon humor to succeed. While he had played in bands since the ’90s\, He
 idecker’s music first began winning a large audience when some of his tu
 nes appeared on Awesome Show\, Great Job\, the TV series he created with c
 reative partner Eric Wareheim\, and his work appeared on two albums of mus
 ic from the show. Heidecker’s love of ’70s soft rock found an outlet o
 n a pair of albums he made with Awesome Show composer Davin Wood\, 2011’
 s Starting from Nowhere and 2013’s Some Things Never Stay the Same. Barb
 ed political satire informed 2017’s Too Dumb for Suicide: Tim Heidecker
 ’s Trump Songs\, while his fascination with vintage pop grew on 2019’s
  What the Brokenhearted Do and 2022’s High School.\n\nGLADIE\nDon’t Kn
 ow What You’re In Until You’re Out\, the second full-length record fro
 m Philadelphia band Gladie\, opens with a contemplative instrumental calle
 d “Purple Year.” Along with acoustic strumming and a late-night wall o
 f cricket-chirps\, cello and gentle horn runs set a dewy\, moonlit stage b
 efore second track and single “Born Yesterday” bursts alive with drums
 \, bass\, and bright guitar chord crunch. It’s like a cold\, heart-jolti
 ng morning plunge as Augusta Koch’s familiar Philly tenor starts in: “
 It takes me more time\, I’m a little unsteady/I was born yesterday\, I f
 orgot I could be somebody.”Koch realized while writing these songs that 
 she had become an entirely different person: a mental\, spiritual\, and ph
 ysical renaissance had unfolded over several years that\, together\, const
 ituted an entirely new reality. Everything had changed\, from relationship
 s with friends to relationships with alcohol. Being on the other side of t
 hese tectonic shifts offered the sort of clarity that you can only get by 
 going through the darkness: You Don’t Know What You’re In Until You’
 re Out. It’s optimistic\, but it’s scary\, too—life changes always a
 re. Who will you be at the end of them? “Born Yesterday\,” which Koch 
 wrote about not drinking alcohol anymore\, offers a critical revelation th
 at guides the record\, and which was hard-earned while experiencing the ov
 erwhelming emotional acuity that developed while living without alcohol: 
 “The way I feel\, I could fill the ocean/When the wave comes crashing in
 \, it said I’m not a fixed thing/I’m changeable.”\n“I like the ide
 a that the record’s title can be both a positive and a negative\,” say
 s Koch. “It could seem sad\, but it can also be hopeful in the sense tha
 t when you’re going through something really rough. It will get better\,
  you will change\, you will survive it\, and you will be able to see it fr
 om a different perspective that you never thought you could.”Don’t Kno
 w What You’re In Until You’re Out cycles through these transitions son
 ically and thematically. “Hit The Ground” is a folksy\, desert-drive s
 huffle\, while “Nothing\,” opening with feedback screech\, is a punk-r
 ock rollercoaster ride that rejects the American cultural drive to want mo
 re and more and more until we die: “What would it feel like to want noth
 ing?” cries Koch.“Soda” tells a shoegazey\, indie-psych love story t
 hat imagines creating our own normal when we’re around the people that m
 ake us feel seen\, rejecting societal pressure to hate ourselves and feel 
 like we’re not enough: “I like the way we live in tandem and the world
  we wish to see/Sweet and cheap\, we thrive on less\,” Koch sings on the
  second verse. The gentle alt-rock waltz of “Smoking” reflects on a de
 eply missed habit\, and pensive\, spacey\, synth-and-cello-centric closer 
 “Something Fragile” ends the record with as many questions as it start
 ed: “Am I something fragile or something strong?” Koch wonders\, still
  finding her footing in strange new realities.\nDon’t Know What You’re
  In Until You’re Out marks the first Gladie production with a set band l
 ineup\, a feature which was previously hampered by the pandemic. As a resu
 lt\, the LP leans into Gladie’s live energy and dynamics\, moving away f
 rom the home-recorded keys and drum machines of their 2020 debut Safe Sins
 .Koch recorded Don’t Know What You’re In Until You’re Out at The Bun
 k in early 2022 with Matt Schimelfenig (guitar\, keyboard\, vocals)\, Pat 
 Conaboy (guitar)\, Dennis Mishko (bass)\, and Miles Ziskind (drums). Schim
 elfenig also recorded and mixed the record\, while Ryan Schwabe mastered. 
 Mark Glick (cello)\, Mike Park (saxophone)\, and Brian Lockerm (trumpet) g
 uest across four tracks.\nDon’t Know What You’re In Until You’re Out
  will be released on November 18th on Plum Records\, the label Koch starte
 d with former Cayetana bandmates Kelly Olsen and Allegra Anka.\n-Luke Otte

 m Lush\, seventeen-year-old Lindsey Jordan sang “I’m in full control /
  I’m not lost / Even when it’s love / Even when it’s not”. Her nat
 ural ability to be many things at once resonated with a lot of people. The
  contradiction of confidence and vulnerability\, power and delicacy\, had 
 the impact of a wrecking ball when put to tape. It was an impressive and u
 nequivocal career-making moment for Jordan.\nOn Valentine\, her sophomore 
 album out November 5th on Matador\, Lindsey solidifies and defines this tr
 ajectory in a blaze of glory. In 10 songs\, written over 2019-2020 by Jord
 an alone\, we are taken on an adrenalizing odyssey of genuine originality 
 in an era in which “indie” music has been reduced to gentle\, homogeno
 us pop composed mostly by ghost writers. Made with careful precision\, Val
 entine shows an artist who has chosen to take her time. The reference poin
 ts are broad and psychically stirring\, while the lyrics build masterfully
  on the foundation set by Jordan’s first record to deliver a deeper unde
 rstanding of heartbreak.\nOn “Ben Franklin”\, the second single of the
  album\, Jordan sings “Moved on\, but nothing feels true / Sometimes I h
 ate her just for not being you / Post rehab I’ve been feeling so small /
  I miss your attention\, I wish I could call”. It’s here that she mour
 ns a lost love\, conceding the true nature of a fleeting romantic tie-up a
 nd ultimately\, referencing a stay in a recovery facility in Arizona. This
  45-day interlude followed issues stemming from a young life colliding wit
 h sudden fame and success. Since she was not allowed to bring her instrume
 nts or recording equipment\, Jordan began tabulating the new album arrange
 ments on paper solely out of memory and imagination. It was after this cho
 ice to take radical action that Valentine really took its unique shape.\nJ
 ordan took her newfound sense of clarity and calm to Durham\, North Caroli
 na\, along with the bones of a new album. Here she worked with Brad Cook (
 Bon Iver\, Waxahatchee). For all the album’s vastness and gravity\, it w
 as in this small home studio that Jordan and Cook chipped away over the wi
 nter of early 2021 at co-producing a dynamic collection of genre-melding n
 ew songs\, finishing it triumphantly in the spring. They were assisted by 
 longtime bandmates Ray Brown and Alex Bass\, as well as engineer Alex Farr
 ar\, with a live string section added later at Spacebomb Studios in Richmo
 nd.\nLeaning more heavily into samples and synthesizers\, the album hinges
  on a handful of remarkably untraditional pop songs. The first few seconds
  of opener and title track ‘Valentine’ see whispered voice and eerie s
 ci-fi synth erupt into a stadium-sized\, endorphin-rush of a chorus that i
 s an overwhelming statement of intent. “Ben Franklin”\, “Forever (Sa
 iling)” and “Madonna” take imaginative routes to the highest peaks o
 f catchiness. Jordan has always sung with a depth of intensity and convict
 ion\, and the climactic pop moments on Valentine are delivered with such a
  tenet and a darkness and a beauty that’s noisy and guttural\, taking on
  the singularity that usually comes from a veteran artist.\nAs captivating
  as the synth-driven songs are\, it’s the more delicate moments like “
 Light Blue”\, “c.et. al.” and “Mia” that distill the albums rang
 e and depth. “Baby blue\, I’m so behind / Can’t make sense of the fa
 ces in and out of my life / Whirling above our daily routines / Both burie
 d in problems\, baby\, honestly” Jordan sings on “c. et. al.” with a
  devastating certainty. These more ethereal\, dextrously finger-picked fol
 k songs peppered in throughout the album are nuanced in their vocal delive
 ry and confident in their intricate arrangement. They come in like a breat
 h of air\, a moment to let the mind wander\, but quickly drown the listene
 r in their melodic alchemy and lyrical punch.\nThe album is rounded out ra
 diantly by guitar-driven rock songs like “Automate”\, “Glory” and 
 “Headlock”. Reminiscent of Lush but with a marked tonal shift\, Jordan
  again shows her prowess as a guitar player with chorus-y leads and rhythm
 ic\, wall-of-sound riffs. “Headlock” highlights this pivot with high-p
 itched dissonance and celestially affected lead parts – “Can’t go ou
 t I’m tethered to / Another world where we’re together / Are you lost 
 in it too?”\, she sings with grit and fatigue\, building so poignantly o
 n her sturdy foundation of out-and-out melancholy. On Valentine\, we are t
 aken 100 miles deeper into the world Jordan created with Lush\, led throug
 h passageways and around dark corners\, landing somewhere we never dreamed
  existed.\nToday\, in the wake of recording Valentine\, Jordan is focused 
 on trying to continue healing without slowing down. The album comes in the
  midst of so much growth\, in the fertile soil of a harrowing bottom-out. 
 On the heels of life-altering success\, a painful breakup and 6 weeks in t
 reatment\, Jordan appears vibrant and sharp. “Mia\, don’t cry / I love
  you forever / But I gotta grow up now / No I can’t keep holding onto yo
 u anymore” she sings on the album closer “Mia”. She sings softly but
  her voice cuts through like a hacksaw. The song is lamenting a lost love\
 , saying a somber goodbye\, and it closes the door on a bitter cold season
  for Jordan. Leaving room for a long and storied path\, Valentine is someh
 ow a jolt and a lovebuzz all at once.\n– Katie Crutchfield\n\nGREG MENDE
 Z\nFor Greg Mendez\, reflection doesn’t mean a static image in a mirror\
 , or even a face he recognizes. It’s more a kaleidoscopic mirage\, where
  paths taken shapeshift with the prospect of paths untread\, and the subco
 nscious merges with the intentional. On his self-titled new album\, the Ph
 iladelphia-based songwriter and multi-instrumentalist investigates the sha
 ky camera of memory\, striving to carve out a collage that points to a tru
 th. But there isn’t a regimented actuality here\; instead\, Mendez highl
 ights the merit in many truths\, and many lives\, and how even the hardest
  truths can still contain some humor.\nWhile this is technically Mendez’
 s third full-length album\, his back catalog boasts an extensive range of 
 EPs and live recordings. He’s a prolific and thoughtful songwriter\, und
 erstanding the joy in impulse\, and shying away from the clinical sheen of
  overproduction. 2017’s “¯\\_(ツ)_/¯” and 2020’s Cherry Hell ga
 rnered acclaim for their quiet\, lo-fi urgency\, exploring themes of addic
 tion and heartbreak with an intentional\, authentic haze\, and it’s this
  approach that has solidified Mendez as a staple in the DIY community for 
 years.\nGreg Mendez was written in fragments\, some stretching across more
  than a decade\, with Mendez reworking old ideas and arrangements\, and ot
 hers blossoming much more recently. The weight of time––and perhaps th
 e anxiety in running out of it––clouds the album\, as Mendez prods at 
 some painful experiences from his childhood and early adulthood. The commo
 n thread connecting the characters is their evident imperfections\, and th
 e various degrees of damage they cause\, both knowingly and unknowingly. B
 ut where do we draw the line between a good person and a bad person? For M
 endez\, it’s never been that easy.\n“There’s a lot of pretty bleak m
 emories in the songs but one thing that I hope comes through is that nothi
 ng is ever fully dark\,” he explains. While recognizing the severity of 
 certain situations\, Mendez is also careful to showcase the absurdity of o
 ur reality\, and how that can often highlight a softness around the edges.
  Opener “Rev. John / Friend” begins with a cartoonish organ\, like a s
 ermon waiting to start\, correlating with the album’s artwork: a Virgin 
 Mary staring at Mendez’s name. It’s a smirk at the serious\, where ear
 nesty can still be encouraged\, and the light and the dark can effortlessl
 y co-exist.\nThroughout the album\, Mendez extends an empathetic and relat
 able hand. The scrappy-pop of “Goodbye / Trouble” waits for “the sou
 nd of God\,” searching for a sense of love or purpose\, but the searcher
  falls apart in the process. The stripped back\, finger-picked “Best Beh
 avior” probes the spite and immaturity that can arise when we feel hurt 
 or wronged\, and how lonely that can leave us. “Maria” mimics those mo
 ments when we reach back to a story and find ourselves immersed in its sce
 nery\, using melodic swells to charge like a memory that floats in front o
 f us\, creating a gauze until we manage to tear ourselves out of it. “Ev
 erytime you say you wanna know me I get anxious\, cause I would probably t
 ell you about some dumb shit\,” the song begins\, glancing at those who 
 also feel wary to show their full selves.\nMendez encourages us to look be
 yond the rigidity of a one\, true self. Some of the “I’s” on Greg Me
 ndez are not Mendez at all but someone unknown\, a person formed to explor
 e the shadows in his periphery. Writing from a different perspective doesn
 ’t happen intentionally\, and Mendez only tends to notice it after sitti
 ng with the song for some time. “It’s kind of like dreams\, where they
  end up being the stuff that your brain is processing\, but you’re not a
 ware that you’re doing it\,” he says. It’s an exhale\, where Mendez 
 allows his instincts to flourish.\nGreg Mendez is an intimate dialogue bet
 ween the chapters we’ve experienced\, and how they can inform the realit
 y we perceive. It’s a reminder that we are constantly shifting\, ever-ch
 anging selves and that if we ruminate too long\, we may find ourselves stu
 ck in the seriousness of it all. Here\, Mendez allows us to take the time 
 to notice what happens outside of the framework we may have built for ours
 elves\, and the beauty that can occur when we finally do.\n

 LFRIEND\nHailing from Wrexham\, North Wales and currently residing in East

 e her debut EP in 2017. Combining organic instrumental textures with blue-
 hour tinged electronics\, the producer/multi-instrumentalist has released 
 two acclaimed albums. With 2021’s Is It Light Where You Are\, Mackey cap
 tured a long-term breakup in vast sonic landscapes\, skittering beats and 
 diaristic lyrics. She followed this with 2023’s Soft Landing – a gauzy
 \, liminal take on finding joy and contentment\, described by Pitchfork as
  an “intimate and adventurous second album… guitars are processed to s
 ound like synths\, synths function like lead guitars\, and drums flip betw
 een electronic and acoustic”. Mackey spent the last year touring and bui
 lding her own studio\, which has become a creative hub for both her own mu
 sic making and working with other artists and bands\; her third and upcomi
 ng record will be a product of her new space\, with fresh music expected i
